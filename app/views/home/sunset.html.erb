      <p class="intro">Websites of all government departments, and those of most other central government bodies, are going to be closed and merged into the Inside Government section of GOV.UK.</p>

      <p class="intro">This will happen in batches, starting soon and finishing in 2014.</p>

      <p>Inside Government will contain government policy, publications and announcements grouped by topic and organisation.</p>

      <p>It will make government information simpler and more open, and save lots of money.</p>

      <p>Organisations will be publishing independently to the platform.</p>

      <p>All existing website URLs will be redirected, so you don't need to worry about changing your links and bookmarks.</p>

      <p>GOV.UK is being built by the Government Digital Service. For more information, see the <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">GDS blog</a>.</p>
