Under existing legislation, people are able to propose changes to Government policies or national laws which they feel would help their local area economically, socially or environmentally.

The new Act improves the process to allow communities a greater say in how their proposed changes can happen.

The principles behind the new Act - and the original Sustainable Communities Act (2007) - are aligned with recent reforms of local government, and the policy direction set out last autumn in the paper Putting the Frontline First.

The Chief Executive criticised in the report has already left the council and has been replaced by Jo Miller as acting Chief Executive on an interim basis. Mr Denham has today appointed Rob Whiteman, the new Chief Executive of the local government improvement organisation IDEA, to chair an emergency advisory board to provide, if urgent decisions are needed, leadership and clear support to the acting Chief Executive.

The report has identified severe failings across the council and the Secretary of State takes very seriously the deep-seated nature of some of the issues highlighted in the report. The Government is now urgently discussing the form that intervention should take, including active consideration of appointing Commissioners to take over some or all of the council's functions.

The Audit Commission report into Doncaster Council found that the council was failing due to a culture of poor governance, following a corporate governance inspection.

The Commission recommended that the Secretary of State use his powers to issue a direction to intervene, and set out steps that could be taken to improve the council's performance.

The Government is already intervening in Doncaster's Children's Services, following their inadequate Ofsted annual rating in 2008. That work is having an impact, as the Audit Commission acknowledges. The action the Government is now proposing will help secure further improvements.

John Denham said:

> ""I welcome this investigation by the Audit Commission and I accept the recommendation in the Report. I take very seriously the failure of Doncaster Local Authority - the Mayor, Cabinet, Chief Officers and Councillors - to serve the people of Doncaster well. From the outset, I have made it clear that I would take whatever action was necessary to look after the best interests of local people. I can make it clear today that I will use my statutory powers to intervene.
>
> ""The Audit Commission's report on Doncaster Council shows the severity of the problems in the local authority across the board and concludes that the local authority is failing the people of Doncaster, not just on one service or issue but in the very way it operates. This is absolutely unacceptable.
>
> ""I welcome the appointment of Jo Miller on an interim basis as acting Chief Executive, following the departure of the Chief Executive criticised in the report.
>
> ""I am immediately establishing an emergency advisory board chaired by Rob Whiteman and involving other senior colleagues with relevant experience, so that if urgent decisions are needed at the council, it can provide clear leadership and support to the acting Chief Executive. I will not hesitate, if necessary, to use my power of direction to enable me, in consultation with the board, to take further action.
>
> ""I am now considering the form of intervention that will best serve the people of Doncaster. There should be no doubt that I am actively considering appointing commissioners to take over some or all of the functions of the council.
>
> ""I call on everyone at the local authority to accept the report's findings, acknowledge the severity of the failings, and work with Government and other partners to move on from this unacceptable state of corporate paralysis for the good of Doncaster.
>
> ""I have asked for an early meeting to be held with other government departments and the LGA this afternoon. In addition I have invited local partners from the public and other sectors to help me form the detail of my intervention and to contribute to the establishment of robust arrangements to ensure rapid improvements in Doncaster. This invitation has been extended by letter today.
>
> ""As a first step my officials will be holding meetings this week with partners and the local authority's leading officers to explore the way forward on intervention.""

Rob Whiteman, incoming Managing Director of the Improvement and Development Agency, said:

> ""The residents of Doncaster quite rightly deserve assurance that every possible effort will be made to help the local council improve. It is absolutely vital that changes are put in place to the way the authority operates, services are safeguarded and local people start to receive a better deal.""

### Notes to editors

1. Where poor performance at local level is critical or long standing Central Government has a wide range of intervention powers, both informal and statutory. Action may range from:

  * Use of statutory powers under section 15 of the Local Government Act 1999 to direct the Council to take specific action to secure recovery or improvement.  This is likely where other action has failed to lead to improvement
  * In the most serious cases, under section 15(6) of the 1999 Act, the relevant Secretary of State may himself exercise certain specified functions of the authority, or appoint a nominee to do so.

3.  As a matter of urgency views on the form of intervention are being sought from the LGA, the Mayor, Doncaster Council and key partners (including South Yorkshire Police, NHS Doncaster, Yorkshire Forward, Jobcentre Plus, Doncaster Community Empowerment Network, Doncaster CVS, South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, Doncaster Chamber and YoHr Space, Yorkshire & Humber Improvement & Efficiency Partnership).

4. The emergency advisory board will be chaired by Rob Whiteman and, if urgent decisions are needed, will advise the Secretary of State.

Mr Clark confirmed that the Infrastructure Planning Commission - a quango with the power to approve major infrastructure projects - will be abolished in line with the Coalition Agreement.

It will be replaced with a new rapid and accountable system where Ministers, not unelected commissioners, will take the decisions on new infrastructure projects critical to the country's future economic growth.

A Major Infrastructure Planning Unit will be established in the Planning Inspectorate to continue fast-tracking major infrastructure projects like offshore windfarms and nuclear power stations. Ministers will take decisions on applications within the same statutory fast-track timeframe as the current regime.

In addition, all National Policy Statements (NPS), the Government's future infrastructure blueprints, will now be subject to ratification by Parliament. Ministers believe these critically important national documents must have the strongest possible democratic legitimacy.

Greg Clark said:

> ""New infrastructure is critical to the country's return to economic growth and we believe we must have a fast track system for major projects
- but it must be accountable.
>
> ""The previous system lacked any democratic legitimacy by giving decision making power away to a distant quango on issues crucial to every community in the country.
>
> ""Today the coalition is remedying those deficiencies by putting in place a new fast track process where the people's elected representatives have responsibility for the final decisions about Britain's future instead of unelected commissioners.""

Energy Minister Charles Hendry added:

> ""A fast and efficient planning system is critical for facilitating investment in much needed new energy infrastructure. By abolishing the Infrastructure Planning Commission we will ensure that vital energy planning decisions are democratically accountable.""

New primary legislation will be brought forward to close the IPC. Until it is in place the IPC will continue to consider and determine applications as National Policy Statements are designated to ensure there is no delay in handling applications.

### Notes to Editors

#### 1. Abolition of the Infrastructure Planning Commission

The Government wants a planning system for major infrastructure which is rapid, predictable and accountable. However decisions on major infrastructure applications should not be taken by an unelected quango. They should be made by Ministers. Abolishing the unelected Infrastructure Planning Commission will reintroduce democratic accountability in line with the Coalition Agreement:

> ""We will abolish the unelected Infrastructure Planning Commission and replace it with an efficient and democratically accountable system that provides a fast-track process for major infrastructure projects.""

The intention is therefore to establish a Major Infrastructure Planning Unit as part of the Planning Inspectorate - an existing agency of Communities and Local Government - which will retain the strengths of the streamlined processes and the experience of the Planning Inspectorate. The Government will put these changes into effect as soon as possible. In the interim, the Infrastructure Planning Commission and the Planning Inspectorate will consider how they can work together and identify efficiency savings.

#### 2. National Policy Statements

The coalition is committed to openness and transparency and it follows that planning decisions should be taken within a clear policy framework, and within clear time limits, making these decisions as predictable as possible. The Government will therefore be pressing ahead with the development of National Policy Statements and will issue a more detailed statement on them later in the summer.

The Government also wants to ensure that National Policy Statements, and the decisions that will be based upon them, are as robust as possible, thus minimising the risk of successful judicial review, particularly by those wishing to abuse the system. The decision-making framework for major infrastructure should have the strongest possible democratic legitimacy. National Policy Statements should be ratified by Parliament. National Policy Statements are critically important documents and they should be subject to public consultation with appropriate local and community engagement, and both scrutinised and ratified by Parliament before designation.

#### 3. Transitional arrangements

Until new legislation is in place the Infrastructure Planning Commission will continue in its present role until it is abolished. During this interim period, should an application reach decision-stage and where the relevant National Policy Statement has been designated, the Infrastructure Planning Commission will decide the application. If an application reaches decision stage and the relevant National Policy Statement has not been designated, the Infrastructure Planning Commission will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State, who will take the decision.

For those applications under active consideration by the Infrastructure Planning Commission when it is abolished, transitional provisions will enable the examination of such applications to continue without interruption, through a seamless transfer to the new Major Infrastructure Planning Unit. There is no question of applications having to restart the process and we intend that the statutory timetable for decision-taking will be no longer than the current regime.

The Government wants to have National Policy Statements in place as rapidly as possible. The Government intends to complete the process for making the Energy (including Nuclear) National Policy Statements, which are part-way through the scrutiny process, and will bring forward revised final texts and ask Parliament to ratify them. Plans for how to take forward the remaining National Policy Statements under development will be published in a more detailed implementation plan - including transitional arrangements and a revised timetable - later in the summer.",29-Jun-2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thurrock Borough Council will absorb the Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation from 1 April 2012. As part of this localist move, decision making power for local regeneration and planning will shift back to into the hands of the local council and communities, who know best what their area needs.

This is a move away from the previous Government's decision to merge the corporation with the Homes and Communities Agency and is part of wider plans to turn Government on its head and end centrally imposed decision making on local areas, including the Thames Gateway.

The change will benefit local residents, businesses and the council, by strengthening local control over regeneration, maintaining the momentum of private sector investment and enabling efficiency savings to be realised.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Putting Thurrock Borough Council back in command of local regeneration puts decision-making power back into democratically elected hands - marking a new era in the area and giving local people more influence to shape the place in which they live.
>
> ""This is part of our wider plans to decentralise strategic oversight of the Thames Gateway, freeing local authorities from the shackles of Whitehall diktat.""

Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation (TTGDC) will cease operation and become part of Thurrock Borough Council from 1 April 2012. The company will move into the Council's premises by March 2011 to work more closely with the council ahead of the change and ensure that vital efficiency savings can be made as soon as possible. The treatment of the assets currently held by TTGDC will be considered as part of the detailed arrangements for the transfer.

### Notes to editors

Last year, the previous administration undertook a quinquennial review of the Development Corporation's performance from inception. Following that review, it was decided that the UDC should be transferred into the HCA. Ministers have reviewed this decision and have concluded that this should not be implemented - believing that it was a centralising measure that would have further distanced local people from decisions about the future of their area. In addition, the consultation undertaken as part of the review showed clearly that there was no local support in favour of this decision.",8-Sep-2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr Shapps argued that some of the best examples of people contributing to the Big Society can be found on England's council estates - looking out for their neighbours and making efforts to make their streets better places to live. Yet only two per cent of council properties are run and managed by the tenants themselves.

So the minister has today backed tenants looking to build the Big Society in their neighbourhoods with up to £8m government cash.

This money will be used to set up Tenants Panels where the key decisions to improve the local area can be made - such as how quickly repairs should be made, measures to make their streets safer and children's play schemes. The panels can also be used to hold landlords to account.

The Minister is also planning to reduce bureaucracy and red tape to make it easier for tenants across the country to use their Right to Manage their council-run properties, take responsibility for managing their home from their landlords and take control for themselves.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Big Society is alive and well in many housing estates across the country - but I want to make it easier for those who want to build the Big Society in their own back yard to do so. The Right to Manage gives council tenants the opportunity to take power back from their landlords, and take control over their own homes and to make the changes they want to see.
>
> ""There are inspiring examples across the country of where tenants have taken control. But at the moment, only two per cent of council properties are managed by their tenants - I want to see that figure increase substantially. That's why I'm backing tenants to the tune of up to £8m, and looking to cut the red tape and bureaucracy that stop so many people from coming forward.""
>
> ""Council house tenants know the small changes that could make a big difference to their local community. They know the improvements that need to be made, and what local people want to see done. I want to see more tenants able to act and take control for themselves. But for years these tenants have felt powerless to act. From today, that can all change.""

### Notes for editors

1. Examples of communities taking up their Right to Manage include:

Bloomsbury Estate Management Board, Birmingham: Members of the board have focused on transforming the 1960s estate, with measures including demolishing a number of maisonettes and houses to rebuild them with low-rise flats; the building of a new leisure complex with funding from a successful Lottery bid, and setting a local ""Bloomsbury Standard"" for improvement to the properties that exceeds the Decent Homes Standard. Since taking responsibility for the estate, the Board has boosted rent arrears recovery and saved £750,000 over five years through better productivity.

Childwall Valley Estate Management Board, South Liverpool: Set up in 2000 in response to the council's 'emergency repairs only' policy, the board have worked to transform the estate by measures including introducing community wardens to work with local young people, the police and Citizens Advice Bureau to reduce anti-social behaviour and a major redevelopment involving the demolition of unpopular high rise blocks to make way for new homes. Over 90 per cent of residents are satisfied with the services provided by the board, and demand for properties on the estate now far exceeds supply.

New Barracks Tenant Management Cooperative, Salford: The cooperative manages 115 houses on an estate of six streets, and have raised funds for installing play equipment, have maintained the local park area, contributed half the cost to installing CCTV on the estate and introduced community activities including street parties and children's playschemes.

Pembrooke Estate Management Board, Plymouth: Set up in 1994, the Board manages the estate of 13 blocks of flats housing around 500 people, and has taken charge of a £5million refurbishment programme. Since doing so, crime rates have fallen, a Youth Service has been set up to encourage training for excluded school pupils and other vulnerable youngsters, and residents' surveys consistently show that local people consider the estate to be well managed, clean and safe.

2. Funding for the Tenant Empowerment Programme (TEP) is £8m over the Spending Review period (£2m in each of the next four financial years).

3. This programme is managed by the Tenant Services Authority on behalf of DCLG. It provides information, training, and capacity building to enable social housing tenants to challenge, influence or control how housing services are delivered to their communities, in order to improve the quality of life for residents. The programme supports activities over and above the activities that landlords' should provide as part of their regulatory responsibilities.

4. Local authority tenants currently have a statutory right to take over the management of local housing services. The _Housing (Right to Manage) (England) Regulations 2008_, together with statutory guidance, set out the procedures to be followed where a tenant management organisation proposes to enter into a management agreement with a local housing authority.

The importance of local solutions to tackle tenants' problems, including an enhanced role for tenant panels, was identified in the Government's Review of Social Housing Regulation - [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulation).",10-Feb-2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consultation seeks views on freeing fire and rescue authorities to tailor their services to meet local needs whilst meeting the wider needs of national resilience.

This more localist approach builds on the approach of the Coalition Government in ending the regionalisation of the fire service and dismantling regional government in England. We have already announced that fire and rescue authorities no longer have to work through Regional Management Boards, and we have stopped the forced regionalisation of fire control rooms through the termination of FireControl.

Launching the National Framework consultation Bob Neill said:

> ""The draft National Framework marks a key milestone to reset the relationship between fire and rescue authorities and central Government.
>
> ""We know that fire and rescue authorities, not Whitehall, are best placed to decide what their communities need. Government must get out of their way and allow them to get on with their vital job of keeping our communities safe.""

The Government is committed to all public services meeting the needs of their communities and the priorities in the draft National Framework are for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * Identify and assess the full range of fire and rescue related risks their area faces, make provision for prevention and protection activities and to respond to incidents appropriately

  * Work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service and

  * Be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

The Minister for Housing slept rough himself in 2007 in order to highlight the plight of rough sleepers and recalling his night on the street he said:

> ""In a civilised society no one should have to sleep on the pavement.""

He acknowledged that factors like relationship breakdown can lead to sudden homelessness, but said that the Government is committed to its recently launched No Second Night Out policy.

Now the Minister has appealed to the public to help rough sleepers by calling one of the 24-hour hotlines to bring urgent assistance to rough sleepers.

For the first time, a complete list of these hotline numbers will be available on the Communities website, the Minister announced as he visited Emmaus in St Albans - a project where formerly homeless residents work to restore second-hand furniture and get their lives back on track.

He also announced his New Year's resolution - to establish a new national single phone number which will provide a central point of contact for people across the country to get help for rough sleepers in their neighbourhood.

Based on London's No Second Night Out number, introduced by the Mayor, this new phone line and website will ensure anyone wanting to get help for rough sleepers in their area will know where to go and who to call.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Christmas is a time for Goodwill, and with winter rapidly approaching, it's more important than ever to ensure that help and shelter are available for those who need it most.
>
> ""We have some of the strongest homelessness protection in the world and councils have a responsibility to ensure that their residents aren't 'roofless' in their area, so I'm calling on members of the public to help them achieve this.
>
> ""It is my New Year's resolution to ensure that a national 'No Second Night Out' hotline is in place by next Christmas, but there are already many local homelessness hotlines available, from Nottingham to Norwich. These numbers are now posted in one place on the Communities website. So my message is simple: if you see someone sleeping rough, please bring them the gift of shelter this Christmas.""

The progress report by the Ministerial working group on tackling inequalities experienced by Gypsies and Travellers contains 28 measures from across Government that will improve outcomes for Gypsies and Travellers across education, health, accommodation, employment and in the criminal justice system.

Gypsies and Travellers experience, some of the worst outcomes of any ethnic or social group including: below average educational attainment; above average rates of miscarriage, still births and neo-natal deaths; and widespread discrimination and hostility.

Ministers are determined to tackle these inequalities and improve the lives of the country's Gypsy and Traveller communities. In November 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles set up a ministerial working group, bringing together seven Government departments, to examine the challenges faced by these communities and to make recommendations for action.

The report by the working group, published today, is an important step in making headway towards increasing equality for Traveller communities by helping mainstream services work better for Gypsies and Travellers. The commitments outlined in the report include:

  * piloting a 'virtual headteacher' who will champion the interests of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils across their local authority and respond to issues of low attainment and attendance
  * promoting of improved health outcomes for Gypsies and Travellers within the proposed new structures of the NHS
  * work to build on our support for authorised sites that have the backing of the local community, through £60 million Traveller Pitch Funding and the New Homes Bonus to match monies raised through council tax. Both the settled and travelling communities will benefit from such an approach
  * improving knowledge of how Gypsies and Travellers engage with employment services
  * preventing hate crime, increasing reporting of incidents and challenging the attitudes that underpin it; and
  * ensuring access to appropriate rehabilitation activities in prison and on probation.

Today Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Immigration Minister Damian Green held the first in a series of cross-Whitehall summits with representatives from the police, the UK Border Agency and local government.

The meetings will find ways to close down thousands of sheds and outbuildings being rented out illegally to migrants, including some with no right to be in the UK.

These 'tenants' are being exploited by ruthless landlords who charge them extortionate rents to live in cramped conditions.

These modern day shanty towns, often visible on websites such as Google Earth, can be plagued with rats and cockroaches - and are potential death traps with dodgy wiring and poor sanitation.

Some foreign 'tenants' wish to return home but, after destroying their passports to avoid removal, find it difficult to do so quickly.

Today, Mr Shapps and Mr Green discussed:

  * encouraging councils to make greater use of legal powers across planning, fire safety, housing and environmental health
  * how to better measure the extent and nature of the problem, drawing on information collected by Whitehall and Town Halls
  * how best to ensure councils and the police share the intelligence available and enforcement activity
  * closer working with organisations such as the Indian High Commission to help those wanting to return home; and
  * steps to prevent more ""beds in sheds"" from being created.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It is a scandal that these back garden slums exist to exploit people, many of whom are prepared to return voluntarily to their home country but instead find themselves trapped into paying extortionate rents to live in these cramped conditions.
>
> ""I want to see a crackdown on these criminal landlords. So today we are launching a national taskforce, made up of the police, local councils, the UK Border Agency and HM Revenue and Customs to close down these 'beds in sheds', help those living there to be reunited with their families and ensure their so-called landlords feel the full force of the law.""

Immigration Minister Damian Green said:

> ""Those with no right to be in the UK must leave the country. If they volunteer to leave, we will help. If they refuse, we will enforce their removal.
>
> ""The UK Border Agency will do whatever is necessary, working with local authorities and the police, to clear up this problem and enforce our laws against those who are in the UK illegally and the employers who exploit them.
>
> ""This work is well under way - many individuals have already been removed from the UK and further enforcement visits will follow.""

The Minister spoke as latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed the number of repossessions unchanged from the same quarter last year. Today's figures show there were 9,600 repossessions during the first three months of 2012 - unchanged from the same quarter of 2011.

Mr Shapps said today's figures underlined how Government action was helping to head off the threat of far higher rates of home repossessions predicted by a leading academic three years ago.

In his report Professor John Muellbauer of Nuffield College, Oxford warned that at the extreme, repossessions could hit levels last seen in the 1990s - and even in more likely scenarios could hit as many as 60,000 a year.

But the Minister also stressed that while today's figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders were below these earlier predictions, there was no room for complacency and that the Government is determined to do all it can to prevent the trauma of repossession for hard-pressed households.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""No family that has worked hard to buy their own home should be left feeling like repossession is the only option - not when there is help and support on offer to ensure that it is only ever the last resort.

> ""Even though figures today show that repossession levels are stable, now is not the time to rest on our laurels. Just as the Government is tackling the problem head on I would urge struggling homeowners to do the same - I would urge them to take action and take charge, get advice early and use the support on offer.""

Mr Shapps said that, just as he is committed to helping people onto the property ladder, he is also determined that for those who already own their own homes, real help and advice is on hand to keep people in their hard earned homes and ensure repossession remains a last resort.

This help includes:

  * A £20 million Preventing Repossession fund giving every council the opportunity to offer small interest free loans to struggling homeowners and ensure that court desks can offer on the day advice for those facing the prospect of repossession.

  * The Directgov website - [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) - which has lots of free advice and information. Helpful advice is also on hand from organisations including Citizens Advice and the National Debtline; and

  * The Mortgage Rescue Scheme, which has been refocused to deliver better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to housing associations and tighter caps on property prices and repair costs, to ensure as many people as possible can benefit from it. More than £200 million has been invested into the scheme, and is now available through councils and housing associations to ensure help is targeted at homeowners most likely to benefit from it.

2. Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that claims leading to a court order have fallen over the past three months by three per cent, and by 12 per cent compared with the same quarter of 2011. The total number of claims for mortgage possession by lenders between January and March this year were five per cent lower than the previous quarter, and 15 per cent lower than in the same quarter in 2011. Of the mortgage possession claims that led to orders in the first quarter of 2012, 50 per cent were suspended.

The Minister said he was responding to appeals by local authorities for more time to take advantage of the new scheme by allowing them three years to reinvest the funds they gain from additional sales into hew housing. He said councils now have a ""prime opportunity"" to refresh their housing stock and help meet the housing needs of hard-working families currently languishing on the waiting list.

The revamped Right to Buy, which will give 2.5 million social tenants the opportunity to buy their home with discounts of up to £75,000 was launched last month.

Mr Shapps has said his ambition is that, for the first time, every extra Right to Buy home sold will be replaced by a new affordable home to rent nationally. He said he had listened to views raised by councils on how they would deliver this ambition, and has agreed to extend their timeframe for spending the receipts from two years to three.

Under the new, light touch agreement between Whitehall and Town Halls published today, councils will have the opportunity to keep receipts from additional Right to Buy sales and the freedom to spend the cash as they see fit to meet local housing demand.

Councils will have the freedom to:

  * decide on the type, size and location of the new homes they build according to local needs
  * work with other organisations such as housing associations to finance and deliver affordable homes for their area; or
  * pass the cash to Whitehall to help deliver one-for-one replacement at a national level.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""By upping the Right to Buy discount to a maximum of £75,000 we've given hope back to thousands of council tenants who want to own their home, and for the first time in years, social housing is on the move.
>
> ""For every extra property sold under Right to Buy we're giving councils the flexibility to build the homes they need, where they need them - or to work with us to ensure every penny raised through the scheme goes towards housebuilding. I've listened to their views, and they now have three years to make the most of the extra funds the scheme will bring.
>
> ""This is a prime opportunity for councils across the country to refresh their housing stock, handing the keys to thousands of tenants who want to cross the threshold to home ownership and building new affordable properties to rent for local families who for too long have been left languishing on the waiting lists.""

To ensure best value for taxpayers' money, Mr Shapps said Right to Buy funds should account for no more than 30 per cent of total investment in new homes - in place of Government funding. This is in line with the highly successful Affordable Homes Programme, which has exceeded expectations and is expected to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015.

However, the Minister was clear that the new homes must be delivered as quickly as possible, which is why councils must spend the cash on new affordable homes for rent within three years of first receiving it. This has been extended from the original proposal of two years in response to feedback from councils.

And if additional Right to Buy receipts remain unspent after three years they will be returned to Whitehall to be reinvested in housebuilding nationally.

### Notes to editors

1. Additional Right to Buy receipts for councils that have not signed the Right to Buy agreement will immediately be passed on to the Homes and Communities Agency or the Greater London Authority for investment. Councils will then be able to bid for funding for investment in affordable housing from this pot.

2. Councils that wish to retain additional Right to Buy receipts for the first quarter of 2012/13, must sign up to the Right to Buy agreement by Wednesday 27 June 2012. Agreements can be signed after this date but will not cover receipts for Q1.

3. The agreement being issued today follows a short technical consultation in April 2012.

4. If Right to Buy receipts remain unspent at the end of three years they must be returned to central Government for investment by the Homes and Communities Agency or Greater London Authority. Similarly, if receipts constitute more than 30 per cent of total investment, then a sum equivalent to the overspend should be returned to central Government.

5. The remaining 70 per cent invested in new affordable homes must come from authorities' or housing associations' own resources, which could include borrowing supported by the additional rental income. (For local authorities this will be possible only if they have sufficient headroom to borrow under the recent Self-Financing settlement.)",15-May-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nightmare tenants whose persistent antisocial behaviour causes misery and fear for their local communities will face swifter justice, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

Mr Shapps said that proposed powers announced today would significantly speed up the eviction process and, for the first time, tackle riot related offences even if they are committed away from home.

At the moment it can take over a year to bring nightmare neighbours to justice - during which they can continue to cause chaos in their local area and misery for their fellow tenants and community.

The Minister said that the powers proposed today - part of a wider package of measures in a new Government White paper - would make it easier to evict tenants if they or any member of their household has previous convictions for anti-social behaviour - cutting out repeated and expensive court proceedings and achieving a better balance between the rights of tenants and the needs of their victims.

### Response to the Riots

Mr Shapps also said that landlords would have a new additional power to take eviction action against tenants if they or any member of their household is convicted for riot-related antisocial behaviour - whether that behaviour takes place in their own back yard or across the UK.

The measure, put forward in response to last year's riots, will ensure that those committing this antisocial behaviour in the future will face the consequences of their actions.

He said that the law abiding majority would be disgusted that people who cause chaos in a riot would still benefit from the valuable support and resource of social housing. The proposed new powers would ensure tenants will not escape the justice they deserve just because their offences take place outside their own community.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For too long communities have been forced to suffer vicious neighbours from hell in misery, while seemingly endless court proceedings held the rights of the perpetrator above the rights of their victims.
>
> ""While eviction should always be the last resort, communities should not have to live in fear of their neighbours while they wait for justice to be done.
>
> ""The powers set out today would make it easier for landlords to take swift, decisive action against their most anti-social tenants, taking previous convictions into account and cracking down on riot tourism by ensuring that a local border won't stand in the way of tackling the worst offenders.""

### Notes to editors

1. A public consultation on proposals to introduce a new mandatory power of possession to enable landlords to take swifter action to evict their most anti-social tenants, as well as extending existing discretionary ground for possession for convictions for riot-related offences anywhere in the UK was held from 3 August to 7 November 2011.

2. Final proposals on the proposed new powers in the light of consultation and our summary of responses to the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourresponse](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourresponse).

4. Examples of recent eviction cases demonstrate the long process currently required to evict:

#### Helena Partnerships: unresolved after one year

In October 2010, a police raid at one of Helena Partnership's properties resulted in the partner of one of the joint tenants being convicted for possession with intent to supply cannabis and possession of heroin. Helena Partnership agreed that one of the tenants and their partner would leave the property, leaving the other in sole occupation.

In December 2010, the same person was found in the property in possession of cannabis. In light of of this, Helena sought an outright possession order. A year later, the landlord was only granted a Suspended Possession Order in October 2011 for 2 years.

#### Gloucester City Homes: two years

A tenant of Gloucester City Homes and her teenage son waged a campaign of persistent anti-social behaviour against their neighbours over a 2 year period including threats of violence, drunken behaviour and drug abuse.

The tenants' Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction Order, granted in 2007, was repeatedly breached, including involvement in the theft of an elderly pensioner's life savings, forced entry and assault of one of their neighbours.

The tenant was eventually evicted in August 2009. Had the mandatory ground for possession been available to tackle the ongoing anti social behaviour, local residents could have been given respite much earlier, with no need for witnesses at the hearings.

#### Adactus Housing: one year

After three years of persistent anti-social behaviour from one of their tenants, Adactus Housing an injunction was first granted in November 2009.

Unfortunately the problems persisted and the tenant threatened and intimidated victims and witnesses who had taken part in court action. A two day trial in August 2010 granted Adactus Housing Association Possession of the property and the tenant was eventually evicted in November 2010.",22-May-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The review identified the number of off payroll engagements worth more than £58,200 per annum across central government - and made recommendations to improve the transparency of these kind of arrangements. The public have a right to expect that their interests are being protected when appointments, particularly senior appointments, are being made. The full review and recommendations can be found at [www.hm-treasury.gov.uk](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk) (external link).

### Call for transparency on local government pay arrangements

Local authorities are each employers in their own right and are not directly covered by the Treasury's Managing Public Money Guidance, which audits senior civil service appointments, and were not included in the review. However, Bob Neill has today publicly written to the Local Government Association to encourage the sector the follow similar principles to those in the Government's policy.

In addition, the Localism Act now requires councils to publish and be accountable for their pay policies, helping to ensure that local remuneration arrangements - particularly for chief officers - provide value for money for the whole of the public sector. In February, the Government published associated guidance on _Openness and Accountability in Local Pay_ which states that local authorities should review the terms of senior appointments, particularly where arrangements could be perceived as seeking to minimise tax payments.

The Secretary of State has said that transparency and openness must be the default setting for the way councils do business. Councils are now expected to have regard to a _Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency_ published by this Government, which covers all their data publications including senior salaries and payments to contractors over £500.

### Pay transparency in the Department

No senior staff in the Department for Communities and Local Government are paid by means of payments to a limited company in lieu of a salary.

In the interests of transparency the Department has published a short list of individuals, currently paid off payroll where the cost is in excess of £58,200 per annum. These were primarily specialist contractors. There is no suggestion that there were any inappropriate tax avoidance arrangements by these specialist contractors.

The Department is leading the way on transparency across Whitehall. It was the first to publish all its expenditure over £500 and it now routinely publishes spend data, ministerial data and senior staff data, as well as new contracts and tenders.

Acknowledging that times are tough, Mr Clark pointed to positive signs. A million new vacancies were notified to Jobcentres in the three months to March 2012 - up 16 per cent on the same period last year. Older people should also take encouragement from the Government's record number of apprenticeship places.

Apprenticeships are not just for the young. Mr Clark said:

Twelve town centres across the country will have a unique opportunity to revitalise their high streets after being selected to be the first Portas Pilots, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said today.

![High Street Illustration (Dermott Flynn)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2082239.jpg)Illustration by Dermott Flynn

Mr Shapps praised the exceptional quality of the winning bids, which will each receive a slice of £1.2 million and a tailored package of support from both the Minister and retail guru Mary Portas.

From Stockport to Margate, successful pilots will be helped to implement their ideas to rejuvenate the town centre, as well as test out the measures in Mary Portas's High Street Review.

### First round winners

The first 12 Portas Pilot towns are:

### Second round announced

The competition to become a pilot received an overwhelming response, with over 370 applications from across the country. Mr Shapps said unsuccessful applicants should not despair - the quality of the bids has been so high that he was launching a second round of the competition, which will see 12 additional pilots announced by the end of July. The Greater London Authority are also funding a further 3 which takes the total to 15.

Mr Shapps said there was no need for unsuccessful applicants to reapply, but they could sharpen up their bids if they wished and submit them again by 30 June, which was also the deadline for new town teams to apply.

The Minister said it was clear that Mary Portas's review into the High Street was the ""catalyst communities craved"" to get together and secure the future of their town centres.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The best local high streets offer more than simply shopping - they are the beating heart of their neighbourhoods: places to meet, work, relax and come together as a community. It's why this competition to become a Portas Pilot has captured the imagination of the nation, with communities across the country uniting to support their high streets.
>
> ""The quality and sheer number of applications has been overwhelming - 12 winning bids now have the chance receive expert advice and financial support, but I believe more towns deserve to be selected. So today I can announce a second round of the competition will see 15 more town centres benefit from this unique opportunity. Together these pilots can be the vanguard of a high street revolution, and others can look to their example to kick start a renaissance of our town centres.""

Mary Portas said:

> ""I've been deeply touched by both the quality and creativity of the bids and the momentum Britain's first town teams have generated in just a few short weeks.
>
> ""It is now clearer to me than ever that Britain wants its town centres revitalised and the energy and accountability for that needs to rest with the people who live and do business there. My sincere congratulations to everyone who entered.""

The Mayor of London Boris Johnson said:

> ""Driving growth and creating jobs through the rejuvenation of London's high streets is at the heart of my mayoralty, and the Portas Pilot initiative is a fantastic way to help us achieve this. Through our regeneration drive we have already started reversing the decay of our high streets that had been allowed set in through long-term underinvestment. So I'm looking forward to receiving some innovative ideas which will help lead the way in steering London out of recession and get these vital economic centres booming again.""

Peter Drummond, President, British Council of Shopping Centres said:

> ""With high street pilots being such a central plank to Mary Portas's recommendations to Government, today's announcement of the winning Town Teams is fantastic news. Local communities from up and down the country have submitted some incredibly innovative ideas designed to boost struggling high streets, and the enthusiasm demonstrated is to be applauded. We look forward to working closely with them in delivering these ambitious plans, providing free mentoring from within our membership and drawing upon the vast experience therein to maximise what can be achieved. However, importantly we consider this the first step in what should be a crucial ongoing initiative for Britain - both in the context of local community and the wider economy.""

Martin Blackwell, chief executive of the Association of Town Centre Management, said:

> ""The competition to be one of the first 12 Portas Pilots has galvanised activity across England focused on improving High Streets. It is a tribute to the resilience of the British public that so many people are willingly volunteering their time, energy and imagination towards saving and improving their own town centre neighbourhoods at the present time. The ATCM looks forward to working with and assisting all the applicants, not just the winners, during the months that lie ahead.""

Liz Peace, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said:

> ""Landlords are as committed as anyone to finding a solution to our struggling high streets and creating vibrant town centres, and we welcome the announcement of the twelve Portas Pilots.
>
> ""Landlords are experts in the fields of property management, place making and marketing, they have a wealth of professional experience that the Pilots can access. We want to give this positive initiative the best possible chance of success and breathe life into struggling high streets.""

### Support for Town Teams

The 12 new pilots' leading Town Teams will now start work to bring their high street back to life. To help them on the path to success they will receive:

  * a share of £1.2 million to put their winning plans into action
  * dedicated contact point in Government to provide advice and support in identifying and overcoming challenges to local business growth
  * free support from retail industry leaders including Mary Portas's own team and access to a range of sector experts
  * opportunities to meet and discuss with fellow pilots to share their experiences and lessons learned

Areas that are unsuccessful will also benefit from the pilots, as the best ideas and solutions will be shared to help struggling high streets across the country.

This is alongside a range of other measures announced by the Housing Minister in the response to the Portas High Street review, including:

  * a £1million Future High Street X-Fund for creative and effective schemes to rejuvenate town centres
  * a National Markets Day and Fortnight, to celebrate local markets and offer budding entrepreneurs the chance to test their business ideas; and
  * a £500,000 Business Improvement Districts fund to help town centres access set-up loans

### Notes to editors

1. More information on the pilots:

> #### Bedford
>
> Bedford's Pilot aims to put a 'buzz' back into the town centre with many vacant shops. One key aspect of the bids is to take one of the empty shops and turn it into a show case, sales and support unit for all the other businesses on the High Street and those who aspire to be part of it. Large businesses will support and mentor small independent retailers, and a contract of care between landlords and their tenants will be encouraged. They will also start more imaginative community use of empty properties, building on 'We are Bedford' events, which use empty shops as art venues, to create a platform for fledgling businesses and a new pride and ownership of the town centre.
>
> #### Croydon
>
> Riot-stricken Croydon's Portas Pilot will help transform the area's historic Old Town market it into a thriving market, food and cultural quarter, emphasising local heritage. The Pilot aims to attract people from the nearby business district and new housing developments by providing the practical everyday essentials that are missing from local high street shops alongside interesting creative offers. The Town Team will bring in pop-up traders, working with other London markets to attract home grown talent, support improvements to shop fronts, creating a member-owned cooperative to provide small loans for this purpose, and establish a food court in Exchange Square.
>
> #### Dartford
>
> Despite Dartford's high average earnings, the town's proximity to London's West End and the Bluewater shopping centre means that very few residents spend on their local high street. Dartford's Portas Pilot will bring the community back into the town centre, opening up spaces for use by classes and clubs, from the Scouts to Slimming World. They will expand market trading days, offer bursaries to set up market stalls and give free pitches to startup companies. They will also offer training to local business owners, reopening an empty unit as a 'social networking shop' for local trades to share knowledge and offer their services and bringing in West End retail experts for a 'school for shopkeepers'.
>
> #### Bedminster
>
> On the edge of Bristol, Bedminster intends to restructure its economy for the 21st Century, tackling the empty shops and anti-social behaviour in the eastern end of North Street and East Street. The Town Team aims to make Bedminster an internationally renowned home of Street Art and Street Theatre, with a permanent route of 25 pieces of locally made art around the area, a pop up street theatre and a permanent outside theatre space. A bicycle rickshaw service, a review of car parking and a review of shared space will tackle the traffic environment.

> Liskeard's hidden high street means that many of its residents are unaware of its charms and are,shopping and socialising elsewhere. The Liskeard Portas Pilot will inject fun back into the tired town centre, battling against the edge of town supermarket with a vibrant arts scene, seasonal and evening events and an evening market. Dedicated volunteers will use flash mob techniques from guerrilla gardening to yarn bombing to awaken the town with empty shops used as art space, and a website and work hub to connect everyone together.
>
> #### Margate
>
> An area of high deprivation and low income, Margate has been labelled as 'Britain's second worst ghost town' with its 36.1 per cent vacancy rate. Margate's Portas Pilot will turn the town's fortunes, putting education and enjoyment at the heart of its transformation. Empty shops will be used for an enterprise centre and courses, 'job club' services and pop up shops. A new quality market will be opened with stalls offered to entrepreneurs, and website, free public WIFI, high street co-ordinator, marketing material and work to improve the look of the local area also help revitalise Margate.
>
> #### Market Rasen
>
> Market Rasen High street often sees people pass through the town on their way to local sporting events, from the races to rugby, but few stop in to visit the shops. The traditional market town's Pilot will help the area draw customers in by bringing pride back to the local area and restoring the market town 'look'. The Town Team plans to 'blitz' the unkempt areas of the town and work with landlords to tackle empty shops. They will advertise the local free parking and revitalise the market with stallholder demonstrations. Local shops will also be encouraged to open stalls and a 'mentoring' scheme will be put in place for new businesses to start on a market stall and work their way up to a high street store.
>
> #### Nelson
>
> The historic cotton mill town Nelson is determined to re-establish its town centre as a vibrant hub for a diverse and multi-cultural community. Nelson's Town Team will attract the town's 2000 students to the town centre by creating a young persons cafe with free wi-fi and space to work and socialise. The town centre will hold sports activities such as morning bootcamps, and a new art and vintage market will also be established with college art work displayed in empty premises. Two empty shops will be dedicated to three month artist commissions and many other vacant sites will be granted to young entrepreneurs and artists, with professional business support and marketing.
>
> #### Newbiggin by the Sea
>
> Just 20 minutes from Newcastle, Newbiggin by the Sea is a small, isolated village ""at the end of a road"", and with 36 per cent of its retail premises lying empty, the seaside town could benefit from a serious boost. The Newbiggin pilot will introduce new branding to help draw people into the town, including people from surrounding holiday parks. Plans to improve local transport will make it easier for those living on the outskirts of town to use their high street rather than heading to the city, vacant shops will be opened up to host pop up shops for new traders and exhibitions, and existing Newbiggin businesses will work together to support each other and draw customers back into the town.
>
> #### Stockport
>
> Stockport's proximity to Manchester and the Trafford centre means this large market town's high street is among the worst affected in England. The Markets and Underbanks area in particular has 25-50 per cent vacancies, yet this recently restored area has huge character and potential. Stockport's pilot will bring a new vibe to the area with venues owned and run by young people, and a creative arts complex 'Seven Miles Out'. There will be a programme of evening events to animate Stockport's unique places and spaces such as outdoor screenings in St Peter's Square. Other elements include using the creative community to 'dress' vacant units, support for current and new occupancies, a new strategy for car parking charges, and street champions.
>
> #### Stockton on Tees
>
> Rather than directly compete with the retail competition of nearby towns and retail parks, Stockton's Portas Pilot plans to become a thriving and vibrant market town destination that attracts both residents and visitors to shop, eat and drink, as well as providing a vibrant business and retail offer. The reopened Globe Theatre will be a local centre for live entertainment which, along with the ARC arts centre and Cultural Quarter, will be a catalyst for the evening leisure economy. Specialist High Street markets and evening markets will make Stockton a unique shopping destination and improvements in heritage areas, such as spotlights on significant buildings will support the evening economy.
>
> #### Wolverhampton
>
> Wolverhampton's city centre has the fifth highest level of empty shops in the country, with strong competition from neighbouring towns and derelict areas attracting graffiti and antisocial behaviour. The WV One Pilot will bring the city will to life by introducing modern day town criers and on-street performers to promote local events and traders already established in the area will receive additional business support. They will also tackle the high level of empty shops head on with a 'dragon's den' style competition to support local entrepreneurs. The winners will receive cash grants, a free place to trade and a showcase shop.

2. The successful bids come from mix of areas from a variety of town centres and high streets across a geographical spread including market towns, villages, large towns, new towns, coastal towns and suburban areas. The pilots cover both high / low average income levels and high / low empty shop vacancy rates.

3. The chosen pilots have demonstrated a transformational vision for their high street and strong support from the local community and a wide range of local partners to make it a reality. The lead partner clearly articulated this vision and demonstrated strong support from the local community and a wide range of local partners. The pilots also demonstrated:

  * **strong leadership** - pilots areas clearly articulated and delivered a transformational vision for their high street
  * **commitment** - demonstrated maximum commitment to the Town Team approach amongst retailers, landlords, the local authority and the local community or community groups.
  * **potential for improvement** - clear articulation of the problems and challenges, including proposing solutions that would bring real change to their high street.
  * **innovation** - set out the most innovative ideas that would have maximum impact and can be replicated elsewhere.

4. The Mayor of London, recognising how this initiative complements his extensive efforts to regenerate the capital's high streets, is joining forces with the Department for Communities and Local Government to invest £300,000 to fund three additional London pilots. The pilots will be selected by the Mayor this summer following a bidding process designed to attract the best ideas that will deliver jobs and growth to some of they city's high streets and town centres most affected by the economic downturn and underinvestment.

5. The Portas Pilots scheme is being supported by other organisations. These include:

  * **Arts Council England**, who will offer advice, expertise and potentially grant support to help develop the cultural and artistic elements of planning the pilots;
  * The **Local Data Company** has agreed to support the 12 pilots by providing free access to its current and historical data and insight along with peering to national trends. **Springboard Research Ltd** has also agreed to provide access data and run workshops for pilots. Evidence based research is important to enable the pilots to get a thorough understanding of the issues that they face, the potential solutions.
  * The **British Council of Shopping Centres** and the **British Property Federation** are coordinating a mentor scheme online so that pilot towns can access free specialist advice on issues like property and planning.

6. _The Portas Review: An independent review into the future of our High Streets_ was published on 13 December, 2011. The Review made ambitious recommendations on what can be done - by Government, local authorities and business - to help high streets deliver something new. The focus is on putting the heart back into the centre of our high streets, re-imagined as exciting social hubs for shopping learning, socialising and having fun.",26-May-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2082239.jpg,High Street Illustration (Dermott Flynn),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
438,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/21464671,New Council Tax help for hard-working families and pensioners,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"New common sense measures will save ordinary families up to £20 a year in council tax, and make bills easier to pay, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today. This comes on top of the council tax freeze over the last two years which has cut council tax in real terms.

Following a consultation, the Coalition Government is today confirming plans to amend council tax rules so elected local councils have greater local flexibility to help residents through fairer approaches to tax billing, second homes, empty homes and solar panels. Further steps will also be taken to support family annexes to help elderly relatives and extended families.

These reforms could allow councils to make up to a £20 reduction in the bill for a typical Band D property in England, or hold bills down by the same amount.

The Government will amend council tax laws to:

  * Make bills easier to pay by giving local residents a new legal right to choose to pay their council tax bills in **12 monthly payments**, rather than the fixed 10 in the course of a year. This will help those on fixed incomes, like pensioners.
  * Promote the take-up of **voluntary electronic billing**, by removing regulatory obstacles. The Government is keen to promote e-billing and direct debits, delivering savings for councils which could be passed onto local taxpayers. Residents will retain the right to hard copy documents, if they wish.
  * Give councils greater local flexibility to choose to waive special tax relief on second homes and empty homes, allowing councils to use the monies to keep the overall rate of council tax down. This would allow a **£20 saving on a Band D council tax bill** for ordinary families. There will be no requirement for councils to make any changes, if they do not wish.
  * There will be no changes to homes which are empty due to the death of the owner or if the resident is away in care or hospital. Nor will there be any changes to the 'job-related' second homes discount. The Government has already provided 100 per cent council tax relief to Armed Forces personnel on operational duties abroad for six months.
  * Reforms will also allow councils to tackle long-term empty homes (empty for more than two years), through an empty homes premium. This is since empty homes can attract squatters and vandalism, blighting communities and harming local amenity of nearby resident families.
  * Prevent a 'sun tax' supplement on bills for homes with solar panels or the need for intrusive inspections where panels are installed by a third party under the rent a roof scheme.  Domestic scale solar panels will continue to be treated as part of the home.

Mr Pickles also announced that his department is to undertake further work into **supporting family annexes**. Ministers are keen to remove tax and other regulatory obstacles to families having a live-in annex for immediate relatives - such as teenagers or their elderly grandparents. Such reforms will help increase housing supply and help ensure the elderly have dignity and security in retirement.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Since 1997 council tax bills have more than doubled. The Coalition Government's council tax freeze has cut council tax in real terms over the last two years.
>
> ""These further common sense reforms will help families and pensioners with their cost of living, keeping bills down and making bills easier to pay.
>
> ""This Government is on the side of ordinary families, who work hard and do the right thing.""

These practical improvements build on other recent Government local tax policies including:

  * Confirmation that there will be no council tax revaluation which would have forced up bills for millions of homes;

  * The revocation of laws which would have imposed bin taxes on family homes;

  * Two years of real terms council tax cut delivered by the Government's freeze grant deal. The average Band D change across England this year as a mere 0.3 per cent. Last year there was no change;

  * New rights for residents to veto excessive council tax increases - this year set at 3.5 per cent. No council tried to increase council tax above this level.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation on technical reforms of Council Tax was launched on 31 October 2011 and closed on 29 December 2011. The summary of the 398 responses can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/technicalreformcounciltaxsors](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/technicalreformcounciltaxsors).

2. Councils can already reduce the discount on second homes from 50 per cent to 10 per cent. The reforms will increase the flexibility to remove the discount completely, so they pay the same as an ordinary home. There will be no changes to the job-related second homes discount.

3. The Government is also to give councils the discretion to reduce or remove the existing 100 per cent tax relief on 'Class A' and 'Class C' empty homes ahead of proposals to abolish both classes in the future. There are no plans to change the rules on council tax relief currently available for homes left empty because a person has moved into a hospital or care home, or has died, or has moved to provide care to another. These are special circumstances where there is a justification for a home temporarily lying empty. Moreover, councils will be encouraged to use their existing powers to apply discretionary discounts in cases where homes are empty due to other justifiable circumstances - for example, hardship, fire or flooding.

4. The Government has undertaken to carry out further work to consider the issue of domestic annexes or so called 'granny flats' and on liability of banks/mortgagees in cases of repossession with a view to developing proposals in due course. Currently, council tax inspectors treat such annexes as a separate property, meaning families get charged twice for the same single property they occupy. Lenders are currently exempt fro council tax in case of repossession.

5. Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home in the years up to 2010-11 before the freeze grant was offered. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double. Average Band D council tax and percentage change between 1993-94 and 2012-13 are shown below:",28-May-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
434,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2152963,£145 million boost to help communities tackle empty homes,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,andrew-stunell,,"A further multi-million pound cash boost for communities will help tackle the blight of empty properties and bring thousands of homes back into use, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

Following bidding processes, 20 successful councils will each receive a slice of £60 million to tackle clusters of empty homes, and voluntary and community groups across the country will receive over £25 million to tackle individual empty properties in their area, ensuring that another 5,600 empty homes are lived in once again.

The number of long term empty homes has fallen to the lowest level since 2004, but with 720,000 empty homes across England, Mr Stunell believes there is still more to do.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The number of empty homes in this country is a national disgrace - for every two families that need a home there is one standing empty. Empty homes bring down a neighbourhood and attract vandals and fly-tipping, as well as being a waste of much needed housing.
>
> ""I'm delighted to announce this funding boost today that will allow councils and community groups to bring these houses back to life and offer families a chance of a stable and secure home.
>
> ""We need to do much more to tackle this problem. This Government is breathing life back into these neglected neighbourhoods.""

Previous announcements have seen £70 million allocated to bring empty homes back into use as affordable housing, the appointment of TV presenter George Clarke as an independent adviser to the government on empty homes, and plans brought forward to allow councils to charge extra council tax on properties vacant for two years or more through the Empty Homes Premium.

Today's announcement brings the total investment to £215 million to bring these empty properties back into use. Ministers believe that targeting the funding in this manner will have more success than previous attempts, such as the Pathfinder programme, that too often left families in half-empty ghost streets.

Empty homes can often attract anti-social behaviour and associated crimes such as vandalism and fly-tipping. By returning these homes into use and providing families with much needed homes, new life will be breathed into these areas as well as providing local training and employment to do so.

20 successful bids from local authorities have been announced under the Clusters of Empty Homes Fund with winning bidders offering value-for-money proposals and match funding alongside strong backing from their local communities.

Examples of clusters of empty homes funding include:

  * A partnership bid across 10 local authorities in the Greater Manchester area, to tackle clusters of empty homes across the area. The project utilises early intervention and advice for owners; matching owners of empty homes with investor landlords; bringing about environmental regeneration; and pioneering an enforced sales process
  * House to Home - an innovative project that will see 100 empty properties brought back into use in Gresham, Middlesbrough, a key town centre regeneration site and priority for the Tees Valley. The bid uses over a £1 million private sector investment and a commitment to use local labour throughout the process.

### Backing community-led efforts

In some areas, the expertise for returning empty homes into use lies with community groups or voluntary organisations and that is why £25.8 million grant is being given to innovative schemes around the country that will allow groups to make a real difference where in the past they have often struggled to be involved or raise financing.

Examples of winning schemes, which have been agreed in principle, include:

  * A homesteading scheme in Stoke to refurbish terraced housing;
  * 7 schemes from YMCAs to return properties to use; and
  * Renovated properties to provide accommodation for women at risk of domestic violence

Independent empty homes adviser, George Clarke, said:

> ""The announcement of this funding is a fantastic step forward in bringing empty homes back into use, especially the £25 million of funding for community and voluntary groups. It's now up to these organisations to think creatively using new forms of procurement like home steading, sweat equity and apprenticeship schemes to make every penny stretch as far as possible.
>
> ""This is an amazing opportunity to rethink the way we refurbish our existing housing stock in Britain and for communities to declare that empty homes are unacceptable when there are so many families in need of a decent home. Although there is still a long way, this is a brilliant start.""

A radical new Right to Build will today put the power to grant planning permission firmly in the hands of communities, Housing Minister Grant Shapps will say today.

The Minister will make £17million available to help local people get their building projects off the drawing board - with an 'early bird bonus' for those that move quickly and get their plans in early.

And a new support hub launched today will offer the help and advice they need.

### Control in the hands of communities

Under the new Community Right to Build, communities will be able to approve new local developments without the need to go through the normal planning application process.

As long as the proposals meet certain criteria and there is the backing of more than 50 per cent of voters in a local referendum, these projects will get the go-ahead.

The Right to Build can be used for whatever communities need to make their neighbourhoods prosper and can include:

  * family houses to sell or rent
  * community halls
  * homes designed specifically to meet the needs of older people
  * children playgrounds; and
  * shops and business facilities

Grant Shapps will today offer a share of £17million to areas looking to start their own building projects.

The Minister will also pledge an 'early bird bonus' of up to £2,000 to those that move quickly and get their plans in by the end of March next year.

And for those looking for advice and support, community charity Locality will launch a new website, phone line, seminars and detailed one-to-one mentoring for those looking to use their Right to Build.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For too long communities have had to use their energy fighting development they didn't want rather then putting it to use bringing about the homes, shops and facilities they did. The Community Right to Build completely changes that and puts communities in the driving seat by ensuring they can bring about the development their neighbourhood needs.
>
> ""The funding and advice service being offered will provide a big boost to those communities eager to take up their Right and bring about change to their area. I would urge all communities to make use of this support to ensure they have the best chance to thrive in the future.""

Chief executive of Locality, Steve Wyler, said:

> ""Locality fought hard to shape the Localism Act. We believe in self-reliance and community ownership. The new Community Right to Build presents incredible opportunities for people to have a greater stake in their area. If you can see the potential of new buildings for community benefit we're here to help, support you through the process and make things happen, enhancing local pride and prosperity.""

The fund will be run by the Homes and Communities Agency.

Chief executive of the agency, Pat Ritchie, said:

> ""The Community Right to Build is an innovative new way of empowering local communities, enabling them to play a more active role in shaping their area according to their needs and aspirations.
>
> ""The funding will support those local groups who want to take forward locally-backed development which will ultimately benefit the whole of their community.""

3. The £17million fund will be available over the next three years (2012 to 2015). The funding is not intended to cover the cost of building, land acquisition or other costs associated with the development itself. The funding is available to communities through England with the exception of London. Separate arrangements for London will be announced shortly.

4. The Locality-led advice support programme, run in partnership with Urban Forum and HACT, is being funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government for three-years.

5. The Community Right to Build forms part of the neighbourhood planning provisions contained in the Localism Act 2011 and became law on 6 April 2012 as part of the Neighbourhood Planning (General) Regulations.

6. In order to use the Right members of the community will need to set themselves up as a corporate body with the purpose of furthering the interests of the local community.

7. Once established the community organisation will have to have their development proposal independently examined and have agreement from more than 50 per cent of people voting in a community referendum.

8. The funding must be used towards the costs of preparing a submission for a Community Right to Build Order - a new route for obtaining planning permission. This could include consulting in the local area or developing the proposal and business case for a community-led scheme.",29-May-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It comes ahead of a new power giving councils more options to tackle record waiting lists and move people out of expensive temporary accommodation.

A change in the law - aimed at tackling record waiting lists that doubled in the previous 15 years - means local authorities will soon be able to fulfil their legal duty to vulnerable residents who fall homeless by finding them suitable accommodation in the private rented sector.

Ministers acted because councils have been restricted by rules limiting how they could help those at risk of homelessness - with those deemed eligible for help able to turn down offers of private rented accommodation and wait for a social home.

This has left councils with a bill for expensive temporary accommodation and other residents languishing on waiting lists.

The proposed rules are contained in a new consultation that also sets out how homeless families should face the least possible disruption when being offered new accommodation.

Mr Shapps published details of the safeguards private landlords will have to meet before councils can place homeless families in their accommodation.

The safeguards include:

  * a current Gas Safety record
  * the accommodation and any appliances or furnishings provided conforming to standards on fire and electrical safety
  * precautions to be taken by landlords to prevent the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning
  * the need for a valid Energy Performance Certificate; and
  * a written tenancy agreement that the local authority considers adequate.

Mr Shapps said the new rules would also ensure families avoided the upheaval of a long-distance move wherever possible.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""With record numbers on housing waiting lists, we're absolutely determined to give councils the flexibility they need to fulfil their statutory duties to the homeless while managing their housing stock in a way that's fair to all residents.
>
> ""At the same time, the most vulnerable in our communities who find themselves homeless through no fault of their own deserve a safe and secure roof over their heads, close to their community wherever possible. These new safeguards will ensure vulnerable families have this reassurance whether they're placed in the private or social rented sector.""

Tradesmen who operate under self check schemes, which allow them to check their own work, will be required to meet higher standards and prove they meet the right levels of quality, giving householders the peace of mind that work on their homes is up to scratch.

The measures will also ensure that householders have a financial safety net in place such as a guarantee or insurance, to catch them if self-check installers fail to finish work properly or if they can't be chased through the courts.

Around 85,000 complaints are made about building work in homes each year according to the Office of Fair Trading.

Current self-check schemes have conditions in place to keep the cowboys out. Today's proposals will further protect people from shoddy work and raise the bar for self-check tradesmen.

Organisations running self-check schemes will now:

  * need to be accredited to an international quality standard in order to operate
  * have to assess that their members' competence levels and actual work are up to national standards; and
  * be required to promote the membership and use of their schemes.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Cowboys builders that leave behind a trail of shoddy work costing householders thousands to put right, give the rest of the industry a bad name. We are determined to keep the cowboys from infecting self-check schemes, which let hardworking competent tradesman get on with providing high quality work, quickly and at fair prices.
>
> ""I'm determined to ensure that consumers are properly protected. By raising the bar even higher for self-check tradesman, we are sorting the rogues from the professionals, making it easier for people to identify competent installers and giving them the confidence that they will receive a high quality of work - or be protected if they don't.""

Clearing out the louts, setting up savvy services and rallying round the community are top of a 'shopping list for success' that can transform run down neighbourhood shops into parades to be proud of, announced Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

Mr Pickles is publishing a new [guide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/paradesstrategies) that gives hands on practical advice and insights on how to restore local shops into vibrant business areas that are full of local character and sit at the heart of neighbourhood communities. This builds on the high street review by Mary Portas and the announcement of [12 'Portas Pilots'](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2136594).

New research shows that local shopping parades - traditionally a neighbourhood preserve of convenience shops, greengrocers, newsagents and cafes - are crucial to the economy. These micro businesses hire on average less than ten employees each, but still account for over half a million local jobs across England.

These vital local shops are facing mounting challenges from lack of investment, anti-social behaviour and competition from online shopping and mega-store discounts. For example in the past ten years out-of-town retail spending rose by almost 30 per cent while neighbourhood stores only increased by 18 per cent.

The new guide _Parades to be Proud of: Strategies to support local shops_ sets out 'a shopping list for success' for village or neighbourhood communities and shop owners to think about to rejuvenate their local shopping parades. It recommends:

  * **Making parades safer** - many local shopping parades have become rundown and magnets for anti-social behaviour like intimidating shoppers, littering or graffiting that affects footfall. Shop owners and councils should work together to find ways to buy lighting, CCTV, shop front awnings or shutters or work with the police to set up neighbourhood watch schemes will all help increase street safety.
  * **Restoring pride in parades** - in order to continue to thrive, local business need to think creatively and innovatively about how to enhance their shops. A collective focus on the parade's selling points, sharing advertising costs, or maximising the impact of personalised face-to-face services and local knowledge can all help restore its reputation.
  * **Rallying round the community** - working with community organisations to champion local events like street fairs or running community services will attract local residents and help make the parade the hub of the community.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said;

> ""In the past too many neighbourhood shopping parades have been left to fade in memory and outlook. Convinced they can't compete with the mega stores and besieged by gangs of louts they have become tatty, no go zones turning our beloved local convenience store into the local inconvenience.
>
> ""We've taken action to back local firms and small shops and today we are offering up ways to rescue run down shop parades by kicking out the louts, set up savvy services for shoppers and restoring the local pride in parades.
>
> ""This Government is committed to promoting local economic growth. Parades should be thriving beacons of local business, home to the character of the neighbourhood community and the local shoppers' destination of choice.""

Today's guide makes it clear that local shop parades have not been forgotten and that their role in the community remains vital. It sets out the Government support on offer to this specific type of local shop including:

  * [Community Right to Bid](http://www.communities.gov.uk/communities/communityrights/righttobid/) which allows local people to step in and save treasured local shops, giving parades the reassurance they can get community support if needed;
  * [Doubled small business rate relief](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2124553) from £6,000 to £12,000 for two and a half years is available to half a million firms with the average tax benefit is around £1650. Inflation increases on bills can be spread over three years;
  * [Councils can offer extra business rate discounts](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2124553) that can be targetted to towards local shop parades as a result of the Localism Act. The Act has also made it easier for local firms to claim the relief they are entitled to;
  * 12 new [Portas Pilots](http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/economicgrowth/highstreetsportas/townteams/) will share in £1.2 million to rejuvenate their high streets and reinvigorate businesses to drive local growth. Local shop parade representatives are encouraged to join their 'Town Team' ahead of a second round of pilots in July. In addition a £1million Future High Street X-Fund will go to the best Town Team schemes;
  * Local parades can participate in their [Neighbourhood planning](http://www.communities.gov.uk/communities/communityrights/neighbourhoodplanning/) forum which gives communities control over how their areas develop. These can make the sure the local shops are factored into the future development and benefit from simplified planning like change of use rules; and
  * A multi-million [Community Action Against Crime Innovation Fund](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/partnerships/innovation-fund/) (external link) is helping local groups and communities to tackle local crime problems. Community Safety /or Crime Reduction Partnerships operate in many communities and can offer support or advice. The Association of Business Crime Partnerships have produced crime reduction guides for retailers.

In addition the Government is also offering wider support through:

  * A [£200 million growth Accelerator fund](http://bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/May/growthaccelerator-uk-small-businesses-smes) (external link) to help up to 26,000 of England's brightest small businesses achieve their ambition and potential, as well as an £82.5 million Start Up Loan scheme so 18-24 year old can get loans up to £2,500, with a repayment period of up to five years, to support and training to start a business;
  * A new [National Markets Day and National Markets Fortnight](http://www.nabma.com/your-local-market/) (external link) in June to celebrate the role markets can play and offer local shops the chance to showcase their produce or business ideas;
  * A [£500,000 fund for Business Improvement Districts](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2120120) is available to help town centres access loans for their set-up costs.

From Abingdon to Accrington market traders across the country are preparing to showcase all that is great about our local markets during a National Markets fortnight beginning on 23 June 2012.

Following the Mary Portas review of the High Street, Grant Shapps announced a National Markets fortnight. The 'Love your Local Market' campaign ([www.loveyourlocalmarket.org.uk](http://www.loveyourlocalmarket.org.uk/) [external link]) will promote markets and allow budding shopkeepers to try their hand at operating a low-cost retail business. ![Love Your Local Market logo](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2158076)

Some of Britain's biggest business success stories started out as market stalls including retail giants such Marks and Spencer, Matalan and Innocent Smoothie. During the fortnight thousands of pitches will be made easily available to business entrepreneurs, young-starts ups and would be retailers to set up a stall and test out their wares.

People will be able to take advantage of the 'tables for a tenner' deal where they can turn up on the day and pay just ten pounds for a stall. Expert advice will also be on hand from 'market mentors' with years experience to offer top tips for success.

Love Your Local Market will kick off at Spitalfields Market in the heart of London's East End. The world famous market, a favorite with locals and tourists a like, is a great example of how markets can compete with high street brands.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles believes markets are a fantastic testing ground for budding entrepreneurs and has praised the national markets groups for supporting traders and promoting such a great British tradition.

Love Your Local Market is being lead by the National Association of British Market Authorities. Over 200 markets are already signed up.

The overwhelmingly positive response from upper-tier local authorities in England means that the Department for Communities and Local Government is on track to meet the Prime Minister's pledge to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families in the next three years.

Councils have welcomed the payment by results model launched in March 2012 to get children off the streets and back into school; reduce youth crime and anti-social behaviour; and put adults on a path back to work.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""It is great news that every upper-tier authority has agreed to run this programme in their area. The fast and unanimous level of take-up shows that the Government has got the confidence of local councils that together we can tackle a problem that councils have long grappled with. We cannot go on spending so much taxpayers' money on such a small amount of families without turning their lives around once and for all. This programme is a unique opportunity to do so and I am delighted that every council has opted in.
>
> ""We now have an opportunity to offer real and lasting change for these families and the communities around them. Everyone will benefit from getting kids off the streets and into school; getting parents off benefits and into work; and cutting youth crime and anti-social behaviour. But it is also right that we will only pay councils in full if they deliver the results that we require.""

It is estimated that these families put a £9 billion drain on public spending, amounting to £75,000 per family per year, with £8 billion of this spent on reacting to, rather than getting to the root causes of their problems.

The Government's £448 million three-year budget is drawn from across seven departments in a bid to join up local services dealing with these families on the frontline.

2. The Framework Document for Troubled Families Funding can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/troubledfamiliesframework](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/troubledfamiliesframework).

3. The payment by results outcomes are:

  * more than 85 per cent attendance in schools and fewer than three exclusions from school

  * a 60 per cent reduction in anti-social behaviour across the whole family

  * and a 33 per cent reduction in youth offending
Payment of £3,900 (in 2012/13)

Plus:

  * progress towards work such as referral and attachment to the Work Programme or the European Social Fund provision for troubled families
Payment of £100 (in 2012/13)

Or:

  * one adult in the family moving off benefits and into continuous work
Payment of £4,000

Local authorities and their partners are expected to make up the remaining 60 per cent of the average £10,000 cost of a successful family intervention.

4. The funding provided under the Troubled Families payment by results arrangements will be available for five out of six troubled families in each upper-tier local authority. This is to minimise double payment for the same outcomes. Government funding has already been provided to support these remaining families. For example, the Department for Work and Pension's £200 million+ European Social Fund provision, the Work Programme and existing government-funded Multi-Systemic Therapy pilots.

5. The Troubled Families Team and the Department for Communities and Local Government will be joined on secondment by Robert McCulloch-Graham who is currently the Director of Children's Services at the London Borough of Barnet.

Near Neighbours uses the parish infrastructure of the Church of England to bring people together from diverse communities and different faiths to get to know each other better, take action on local issues and help them to transform their local neighbourhood.

Attendees of all faiths heard from groups across Waltham Forest that are fostering greater understanding of each other's cultures, including:

  * the parish of St Barnabas with St James, which is bringing local Christians and Muslims together to discuss community safety concerns
  * Waltham Forest Asian Seniors' Club, which is working with the Shem Hall Methodist church to develop a new 'healthy lunch club' for pensioners
  * and the Intergenerational Community Mentoring Project, which has been training adults of various faiths - who have overcome issues including homelessness or unemployment - to become mentors to local young people.

The Temple is itself linked to St Andrew's ecumenical church, Walthamstow as part of the Faith Friendship Club which connects Hindus and Christians through art, music and dance.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Our faith groups play a vital role in our communities with a strong tradition of giving back, improving the lives of those around them through practical action.
>
> ""It's great to hear from communities in East London that are taking up Near Neighbours with such enthusiasm, coming together to do great things for the common good.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps today welcomed new figures showing a ""rapid and dramatic"" increase in the numbers of new affordable homes being built.

Figures published today by the Homes and Communities Agency show that affordable housing starts in the six-month period to March 2012 were up by nearly 15,000 compared to the first half of the last financial year.

At the same time, the numbers of affordable homes for rent and affordable home ownership completed in the 12 months to March stood at over 51,000.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Far from the predictions of the doom merchants, today's figures show work has started on over 15,000 new affordable homes since last September - a massive increase on the previous six month period. This is clear evidence that our efforts to get Britain building are starting to yield impressive results.
>
> ""I am also impressed at how, as we've moved to our new housebuilding programme, developers up and down the country have taken up the exciting opportunity to build thousands of new affordable homes. This rapid and dramatic progress means that we are well on track to exceed all original expectations and deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes over the next few years.
>
> ""But even with the need to cut the record deficit we inherited, I'm clear there's still more to do. That's why on top of the £4.5billion we're investing in affordable homes, we're also spending £1.3billion to get stalled developments back on track and to build the infrastructure needed to unlock sites for housing.""

![Bob Neill at Stratford market](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2161015.jpg)Bob Neill meets market traders in Stratford

Attending the topping out of the multimillion-pound Spenhill scheme in Woolwich, the Minister was encouraged to see now the development is providing a lasting legacy for the community, bringing homes and retail to the area. The Minister was delighted to award prizes to local school children whose art work proudly decorates the worksite hoardings.

Whilst visiting Woolwich, Mr Neill said:

> ""I'm delighted to see the regeneration of Woolwich first hand and congratulate those involved on all their hard work. This scheme is providing jobs for local workers, much-needed homes and a wonderful new retail centre. 2012 is going to be a landmark year for this area of London and the Government is committed to ensuring areas like Woolwich develop a lasting legacy.""

Tony Fletcher, Regional Corporate Affairs Manager, Tesco, said:

> ""Woolwich Central will deliver a range of benefits to the area including much-needed new homes, jobs for local people and a major contribution to the local shopping offer. Work on site is progressing apace and we're delighted to be on track to deliver the first 259 homes by the end of 2013. We are pleased to be making this important contribution to the renaissance of Woolwich town centre at this exciting time when the area is benefiting from a range of improvements in the run up to the Olympics.""

Mr Neill also travelled to Stratford town centre, close to the Olympic Park, to see how Government investment is improving the local environment. The Department for Communities and Local Government has contributed towards £15.9 million of public realm funding that has seen new paving, lighting, street furniture and major new civic art work revive the area. The funding highlights that whilst the Olympic Park receives many millions in investments it is important that the surrounding areas also benefit from a lasting legacy of regeneration and investment.

In Leyton, Waltham Forest, the Minister met local shop owners and saw how £5 million of public realm funding is improving the civic environment and inspiring local shops to bring a new lease of life into the High Road. Public realm funding is enabling the local community to build on the existing strengths of local high streets and town centres to support economic vitality during and after the Olympic Games.

Tenants on high salaries would in future pay a fair level of rent for the privilege of living in a social home, under plans announced by Housing Minister Grant Shapps today.

The Minister argued that this ""handout to the very rich"" must end if social housing is to offer the vital support system to those in need. On average the economic subsidy provided by this to high earning social tenants in England is worth as much as £3,600 a year - a subsidy Mr Shapps said he considers unfair both to taxpayers and those who have been left languishing on social housing waiting lists.

The proposals published for [consultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/paytostayconsultation) today would see high-income tenants - for example those earning above £60,000 or £100,000 - potentially paying up to market rents if they want to continue living in taxpayer-subsidised housing.

The move could see tens of thousands of high earning social tenants paying market rents to continue living in their social homes.

Mr Shapps said that with millions of people languishing on waiting lists, it was right that those who could afford it 'pay to stay' in homes that should be helping those in the greatest housing need.

### New powers for landlords

Today's proposals would give social landlords the extra flexibility they need to increase rents for high-income households - and seeks views on whether this is something landlords should be required to do. The additional income generated could then be used by landlords to increase spending on affordable housing.

Ministers believe the changes are necessary to address the problem of precious social housing resources being occupied by tenants who could comfortably afford to live elsewhere.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long, millions of people on waiting lists have watched helplessly as high-earning social tenants continue to occupy homes designed to help the most vulnerable. These high-income tenants are not only blocking homes that could benefit those in greater housing need, they're also relying on poorer taxpayers to subsidise their lifestyle.
>
> ""A lazy consensus about the use of social housing has left landlords powerless to deal with this problem. So we want to call time on this blatant unfairness and these handouts to the very rich. Proposals I've announced today will give landlords the option to charge high-earning social tenants a fair level of rent - so if they want to continue using this precious national resource, they will pay for the privilege.""

### Social housing shake-up

The 'pay to stay' consultation will consider the income threshold for higher rents - the proposals are part of the most radical and fundamental reform of social housing for a generation, making the system fairer and more flexible so councils can better meet the needs of local people.

Ministers believe that in times of economic hardship, it is more important than ever that social housing helps the most vulnerable in society.

Tenure reforms will allow social landlords far greater freedom to target their resources at those who need a social home, for as long as they need it, by granting fixed term tenancies to new tenants where appropriate.

New allocations rules will give greater priority to members of the Armed Forces applying for social housing, and will enable councils to prioritise those with a long-standing connection to the local area.

Local authorities will also be given new powers to reject applications for social housing from people who already own a perfectly acceptable home of their own - including those who come to the UK from overseas.

A separate consultation is currently considering stronger measures to tackle those who abuse social housing by unlawfully sub-letting their homes; and a consultation has just ended that will give landlords stronger powers to tackle tenants who make their neighbours' lives a misery through anti-social behaviour.

![Flag of the Falkland Islands](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2161124.jpg)The Falklands' flag outside Eland House

Mr Pickles has asked for the flags of the United Kingdom's Overseas Territories - from Anguilla to the Turks and Caicos Islands - to be proudly flown by the Department as part of a formal recognition of the continued important and close relationship with the country. This follows from a programme of flying England's county flags last year. The Falklands' flag, which is also being flown outside Downing Street and the Foreign Office, appears alongside the Union flag, which is flown all year round.

The flags will be flown at appropriate times in the coming months to recognise national days of significance. Britain has 14 Overseas Territories which encompass over 600,000 square miles and are home to 260,000 people - more than Nottingham or Newcastle. The Falkland Islands are made up of over 700 islands with the two largest, West and East Falkland home to around 3,000 people.

Liberation Day on 14 June marks the anniversary of the Falkland Islands being freed by British forces after an unprovoked Argentine invasion thirty years ago - marking the end of the battle in the South Atlantic.

At the ceremony of hoisting the Falklands' flag, Eric Pickles said:

> ""Today, we pay tribute to the bravery of our Armed Forces thirty years ago in liberating the Falklands from totalitarian aggression.
>
> ""British forces put their lives on the line to defend British sovereign territory, the British way of life and the rights of British people to determine their own future. This is was a victory both for freedom and the indefatigable spirit of the Islanders.""

The Hon Dick Sawle MLA said:

> ""This year is an important one for Falkland Islanders. Not only does it mark 60 years on the throne for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, but also, 30 years since the cessation of hostilities with Argentina. As a proud member of the UK Overseas Territory family, relations between the Islands and the UK are closer than ever. I am sure that this gesture by the DCLG will be appreciated by all Islanders.
>
> ""Liberation Day is the perfect day to fly the Falkland Islands flag and we are grateful for Her Majesty's Government for its continued support.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is currently assessing responses to a discussion paper on relaxing the planning regime on flag flying and allowing people to fly more flags without having to seek and pay for planning consent from their local authority.

2. There are 14 UK Overseas Territories, 11 of which have permanent populations.  Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands are all in the Caribbean. Bermuda is in the North Atlantic Ocean whilst the Falkland Islands and the Territory of St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha are located in the South Atlantic. Pitcairn, with a population of less than 60 people, is the only Territory in the Pacific. Gibraltar and The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekilia in Cyprus are the only territories in Europe. The remaining Territories, ie the British Antarctic Territory, the British Indian Ocean Territory, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (in the South Atlantic Ocean) do not have permanent populations.

396,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2161261,Funding boost for strong homelessness safety net,providing-housing-support-for-older-and-vulnerable-people,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,grant-shapps,,"Cash to help advice service continue

Advice and support services for frontline staff helping families facing the real and frightening prospect of homelessness are to receive a cash boost from Government, strengthening one of the world's strongest safety nets against homelessness, Housing Minister Grant Shapps announced today.

It comes as new figures today show that councils have already helped over 13,000 vulnerable households secure alternative homes and avoid living on the streets, showing that many people are still suffering from the legacy of a debt-laden economy.

Mr Shapps announced £3.4 million to the National Homelessness Advice Service to ensure it continues to deliver the vital support services to equip local agencies to help thousands of families across the country.

Today's funding, to be shared between Shelter and the Citizens Advice Bureau, will help provide:

  * Vital training for homelessness advisors
  * A National Information Service to keep advisers up to date on homelessness prevention law
  * Help with mortgage debt and money advice for those at risk of repossession; and
  * Legal services for local advice bodies like councils and voluntary organisations.

Today's funding is part of the £400 million Government funding already in place to help those at risk of homelessness until 2015.

In addition, £70 million has been made available for homelessness services including:

  * £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund to help protect vital front line services
  * £20 million Preventing Repossessions Fund to enable local authorities intervene earlier and help people stay in their homes
  * £18.5 million Single Homelessness Prevention Fund to help ensure single homeless people get access to good housing advice
  * £5 million boost to the Homelessness Change Programme to deliver improved hostel provision and provide over 1,500 new and improved bed spaces.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This country has one of the strongest safety nets in the world to protect families and vulnerable households from losing their home, which has helped ensure homelessness remains lower than for 28 of the last 30 years and half the average rate under the previous administration. I am determined that we do all we can to keep this in place.
>
> ""But it is clear that the earlier families act, the more options are available to help avoid the worst. That's why today's cash boost is vital to ensuring that when people ask for help, the practical advice and expertise is there.
>
> ""No hard-up household at risk should fall through the cracks - today's new funding will help ensure that everyone has access to support when they need it most.""

Figures published today show that councils helped over 13,000 vulnerable households secure alternative accommodation when faced with the prospect of homelessness.

Councils have a duty to provide help for households facing homelessness through no fault of their own and in priority need, and can provide free advice and information to prevent homelessness.

Under the Localism Act, councils will have greater powers to fulfil this duty by housing people at risk of homelessness in stable, secure accommodation in the private rented sector.

This will mean shorter waiting times for homeless households, and will leave councils better equipped to help the 50,000 families currently living in temporary accommodation.

The Sustainable Communities Act provides a way for people to ask, via their local council, that central government removes barriers that hinder them from improving their area.

Many community action groups have come up against bureaucracy that holds them back from delivering innovative ideas that will make their village or town a better place to live - such as planning regulations or bye-laws. The Act provides a clear process to reduce or remove barriers affecting local action.

Groups or individuals using the Act will now have more opportunity to ensure their bureaucracy cutting proposals are successful. New regulations being introduced this week include a new light-touch duty that ensures previously dismissed proposals can be reconsidered.

A third party 'selector' will be able to provide a robust challenge by asking Government to review its decision on behalf of a local authority so that the Government has to fully justify its reasons for rejecting the original proposal, making it more accountable.

The Government will also need to consult and try and reach an agreement with the 'selector' before a decision is made on whether the proposal should be implemented.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Local people often have great ideas for their areas and are keen to improve their neighbourhoods yet are met with a plethora of rules and regulations that do nothing but stand in their way.
>
> ""Ensuring people can challenge these rules will make the Government much more accountable for the rules it implements. Government's role should always be to support local people, not stop them.
>
> ""These new regulations help enforce that notion and put the power where it belongs, at the local level. They will help replace the implicit 'no' to improvement in our cities, towns and villages with an explicit 'yes'.""

A consultation on whether town and parish councils should be given the power to submit Sustainable Communities Act proposals was also launched today. Currently they have to submit their proposals via their local authority.

The consultation recognises the important role these councils play in their area and acknowledges they often know best the barriers they face on the ground in bringing about local improvements.

### Notes to editors

1. The regulations will be laid on 15 June 2012 and come into force on 26 July 2012.

2. The name of the 'selector' will be confirmed in the near future.

390,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2162103,Rock Starr's home saved with a little help from his friends,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,grant-shapps,,"A tide of community support has saved Ringo Starr's childhood home from the wrecking ball, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

![Madryn Street sign](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2162595.jpg)Madryn Street was previously earmarked for demolition

Fans of the Fab Four from across the world will now be able to pay homage to the childhood home of the Beatles drumming maestro - 9 Madryn Street, which joins the Cavern Club and the childhood homes of Sir Paul McCartney and John Lennon as beacons of Beatlemania.

The Minister confirmed that he was making over £13.5 million available to help bring empty homes across Liverpool back into use. This, and the efforts of the local community have ensured that the streets Ringo Starr grew up on will be preserved for years to come.

Yesterday, Mr Shapps visited Madryn Street with the city's Mayor Joe Anderson to see first hand the ambitious plans now being worked up to hand Ringo's former home and other homes in Madryn Street that were previously earmarked for demolition over to the community.

### A long and winding road

The decision to save Madryn Street marks a victory for the local community and Beatles fans who for years battled to save Starr's home.

Aware of local opposition to the demolition plans, Mr Shapps stepped in to ensure that the views of local people were properly heard, and that other options were being considered.

He asked TV's George Clarke, newly appointed as Empty Homes Independent Adviser, to work closely with Liverpool City Council, the local community and housing associations to see what could be done before sending in the bulldozers.

Now, in a ground breaking experiment Liverpool City Council have agreed to give the local community the opportunity to take over and refurbish 16 of the properties on the street, and in doing so gauge the demand for such properties in the wider area.

This means that, thanks to their combined efforts and the extra millions of pounds Mr Shapps has been able to secure, Ringo Starr's former childhood home can now be preserved for years to come.

The Government are determined to bring more homes back into use. £155 million has been allocated to bring more empty homes back into use, including £60 million to tackle clusters of these empty properties. The Government have also been working to save homes from demolition and address the problem of 'ghost streets', to help ensure families are not trapped in half-empty and abandoned streets.

The cash will be used as part of a funding package to save 750 homes from demolition in Liverpool. These will now be refurbished and brought back into use.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Ringo Starr's home is a significant beacon of Beatlemania, a bricks and mortar reminder of a hugely important influence on British music. But it's also a lot more than that - a real example of communities having the power and voice to step in a save the places they treasure most.
>
> ""With the Help! of Liverpool residents we worked it out and Madryn street can be saved for the nation. Its future will now be in the hands of local residents - if they can make a success of this street then many more similar houses and streets could be saved.
>
> ""The £14million will help to transform run-down houses into homes to be proud of. Rather than destroy swathes of housing indiscriminately, we have listened to the local community. This is a step forward in making Madryn Street a great place to live as well as a must-see stop off while on a Magical Mystery Tour of this great city.""

He added:

> ""I am delighted that Ringo Starr's former childhood home is just one of 16 homes in the Welsh Streets that we're saving from the bulldozers.
>
> ""Today presents a real opportunity for the local community to preserve and protect these properties for the future, but I'm keen that this is just the start.  That's why I'll be watching closely to see how the refurbishment of these 16 homes progresses, and how we can use this to prevent more homes from being demolished.
>
> ""With a further 750 homes set to be preserved across Liverpool, I want to see this local commitment continue.""

![Love your Local Market logo](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2158076)Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and Apprentice star Adam Corbally today joined forces to call on communities and budding entrepreneurs to use the local markets fortnight to back new businesses and a high street revival.

The two week event will start next Saturday (23 June) on National Market Day. Around 300 local markets will be involved in celebrations all over the country to attract visitors into towns, help new start-ups and boost enterprise.

Adam Corbally, formally a market-trader and now a successful businessman, is offering would-be traders his top ten tips for running a market stall.Tips include: get there early; set up near a cafe or toilet for more footfall; get your prices right; and remember smiles and tales make sales.

Love Your Local Market fortnight will encourage budding entrepeneurs and shopkeepers to try their hand at operating a low-cost retail business at the market. Thousands of extra low-cost pitches will available to entrepreneurs, business starts-ups and would be retailers.

There will be a 'tables for a tenner' deal so people can turn up on the day and pay just ten pounds for a stall. Some places will also have expert advice on hand from experienced 'market mentors' offering helpful advice to new traders.

Mr Pickles has written to every council in the country urging them to make the most of this 'exciting opportunity' to support their high street and boost the local economy by considering things such as temporarily pedestrianising streets and relaxing parking and delivery restrictions as well as supporting advertising for local events.

Adam Corbally's top tips are part of a short guide being published next week called ""Getting Started"". Produced by the National Association of British Market Authorities, it will offer helpful advice for people looking to get started as a market trader or establish a market including who to speak to, grants and what to do about insurance.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The bustle of a busy market has long been a great British tradition. Markets are a vital and vibrant part of any town's shopping experience. These energetic traders are not just somewhere to find a great deal, they are an important part of local economic life that deserve our support.
>
> ""Love Your Local Market fortnight is a really exciting opportunity for towns and villages to boost their high street economy. For any local entrepreneur who's dreamt of starting a business, now is the time to try it and take advantage of the special trader rates on offer - it doesn't come much better than a tenner to start a new business.""

Adam Corbally said:

> ""I am really passionate about markets and proud to support this fantastic Love Your Local Market fortnight.
>
> ""My top tips come from the heart and are based on 14 years of trading. They're a straight forward and simple way to do it right - the kind of advice I wish I'd been given when I started out.
>
> ""I hope as many people as possible get stuck in and have a go at running a stall - if I can make it a career so can you - either way, head down to your local market and see what's on offer.""

Minister for Markets Andrew Stunell said:

> ""From Stockport to St. Ives market traders across the country are preparing to showcase all that is great about our local markets. Some of Britain's biggest household names started off on market stalls and Love Your Local Market, starting on 23 June, could be the fortnight that kick starts a few more budding British businesses.""

First announced as part of the Government's response to Mary Portas' review of the High Street, the Love Your Local Markets fortnight is being run by the National Market Trader Federation and the Markets Alliance.

Graham Wilson, Chief Executive of National Association of British Markets Authorities said:

> ""Markets provide excellent opportunities for new start businesses and I am delighted that so many markets have responded to Mary Portas' proposal for a National Market Day. Love Your Local Market and National Market Day will also provide markets with the chance to demonstrate their value to the local communities they serve and we are going to see lots of celebration and innovation during the fortnight of the campaign.""

Joe Harrison, Chief Executive of the National Market Traders Federation added:

> ""This is a great initiative to get more people trading on markets, and is an excellent way for them to dip their toes into our industry. It's in line with what Mary Portas recommended in her review, and puts a deserved focus on retail markets, which are at the heart of town and city centres.
>
> ""The campaign reinforces what the federation is doing to encourage entrepreneurs to set up in businesses on markets by producing a comprehensive training guide for first-timers. Also it's not about taking a job, but about creating one, and that is something I am sure the Government wholeheartedly supports.""

### Notes to Editors

1. One of the stars of this year's Apprentice, Adam Corbally, started out as market-trader in his hometown of Glossop, Derbyshire and now runs a successful wholesale and retail fruit and veg business and manages his own property portfolio. Here are his top ten tips for market stall start ups:

> 1) **The early bird catches the worm**. Get there early, get set up and be prepared.
>
> 2) **Get the best pitch**. As crazy as this may sounds, always pitch near the toilet or the cafe, people generally visit both on a market, if you're near them you'll get the footfall. If you are casual then get the best pitch you can and then you can always work your way up, respect that some traders will have been there for years.
>
> 3) **Setting up to sell**. Always judge your pitch from 25ft away, not stood at it. If it doesn't look right from afar, people won't feel invited to have a look around.
>
> 4) There is **no such thing as bad weather**, it's just not dressing for bad weather. Wrap up and always have waterproofs at the ready. A comfy trader is a happy trader. Don't forget about the good weather either, sunhat and sun screen are a must, people forget that the English sun is the same as the Spanish sun.
>
> 5) **Float**. Never overlook the importance of having a healthy float at the start of the day, if you start running around looking for change, you will lose sales.
>
> 6) **Things to remember**: Bungee cords (You will see what I mean once you start trading), Bags (For customers to take away from the stall), Cash Till/Box/Pouch (You'll always need somewhere to keep your money).
>
> 7) **Get your pricing right**. People go to a market for a bargain, make sure you have everything priced clearly. I personally like a deal when I'm on a market, on the flip side I never walk away from a sale.
>
> 8) Sales. If you are selling something and you believe in it, you will sell it - trust me and remember to smile, **smiles make sales**. Simple!
>
> 9) Connect, talk to people - **tales make sales**, find common ground and relate to people. If people want a robot, they will go to a supermarket.
>
> 10) Network. **Talk to other traders**. Introduce yourself, give/receive ""traders"" discount, discuss other markets and learn from one another. Remember it is not what you do it's how you do it, and if you do it right you will get results.

1. The Government announced plans in August 2010 to disband the Audit Commission. In the future, councils will be free to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market and there will be a new audit framework for local health bodies. This will save council taxpayers' money and bring in a more localist approach.

Rushmoor Borough Council, Kent County Council and The Royal Borough of Greenwich will each receive £200,000 and Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council in Warwickshire will receive £50,000 this year to take the lead in developing local projects and support services in their authority and in neighbouring councils. In addition each authority will work with Gurkha charities in developing training to help veterans adjust to life in their new communities and promote better understanding among residents.

The funding builds on £500,000 given to Rushmoor in Hampshire last year to help ease the exceptional pressures placed on health, education and social services in the towns of Aldershot and Farnborough by the arrival of a high number of elderly Nepalese nationals over a short period of time.

Since then the Council, together with the Gurkha Welfare Trust, has been developing ideas to support the wider settlement of retired soldiers and their dependants. Today's allocation also awards the Council £200,000 to establish a special interest group on Gurkha settlement.

The Council will take the lead in helping local authorities across the country improve their veteran services support and develop a partnership with Citizens Advice to improve local advice for families, which will help to reduce the pressure on the over-stretched Gurkha Welfare Centre in Aldershot. A further £150,000 will be made available for English language support for Gurkhas and their families to help improve their employability and build better community relations.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We should all feel proud of the immense contribution the Gurkhas have made to the British Army and the tremendous sacrifices they have made for our country. We should also be proud of the good relations fostered between the ex-Gurkhas their families and local communities.
>
> ""We recognise the continued pressures faced by Rushmoor Borough Council but in giving financial and practical support to other authorities this will help ensure that there are positive choices available to new Gurkha migrants to settle and make an active and positive contribution to life in their new communities.""

Peter Carroll founder of The Gurkha Justice Campaign said:

> ""The fact that this money has been found at this difficult time is testament to the commitment of the Government to do all it can to help these fine former warriors and their families to settle in Britain. The effort to make sure this money is spent wisely is a tremendous example of Government departments working together with charities and other agencies to make a positive difference.""

William Shuttlewood OBE, Director of The Gurkha Welfare Trust said:

> ""The Gurkha Welfare Trust, the lead Gurkha Charity, welcomes this initiative by the Department for Communities and Local Government. It will provide some much-needed help for local councils and other agencies responsible for providing welfare and other support to ex-Gurkhas seeking settlement in their local communities. The Trust looks forward to continuing to work in partnership with local councils and other agencies not only by providing welfare and other support but also by helping to promote integration within local communities.""

### Notes to Editors

1. Parliament has decided that retired Gurkhas who served between 1948 and 1997 would be able to apply to settle in the UK with their families.

2. The funding of £1.5million fund over two years has been agreed between Communities and Local Government, Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. Each department will contribute £500,000. This was announced on 15 November 2011. Today's allocation awards Rushmoore Borough Council, Kent County Council and The Royal Borough of Greenwich £200,000 each and Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council in Warwickshire £50,000. Each of these authorities will act as lead authorities for their counties, neighbouring counties, and councils. Rushmoor Borough Council will be the lead authority for North Hampshire, Berkshire, Surrey and Swindon. The Royal Borough of Greenwich will be the lead authority for London. Kent County Council will be the lead authority for Kent and Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council will be the lead authority for the Midlands and South Yorkshire.

3. Rushmoor Borough Council has also been awarded £200,000 to establish a special interest group on Gurkha settlement to help these authorities improve their veteran services support and develop a partnership with Citizens Advice. A further £150,000 will be made available for English language support for Gurkhas and their families to help improve their employability and build better community relations.

4. Rushmoor Borough Council have estimated between 6,000 and 12,000 people of Nepalese origin live in the area; the official population of the council area is just over 90,000. This group has an unusual demographic, with large proportions of older people and children. This has increased pressure on social, health and education services (over seven per cent of school children have Nepali as their first language).",19-Jun-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tenancy cheats who deny social homes to families in need will ""feel the full force of the law"" under new plans published today, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said.

The Minister said the Government would back a new Bill, introduced in Parliament today by Conservative MP for Watford Richard Harrington, which would make the subletting of social homes a criminal offence.

### Creating an effective deterrent

Estimates suggest that between 50,000 and 160,000 social homes are unlawfully occupied across the country.

Tenancy cheats can earn thousands of pounds a year renting their social homes out to private tenants, while thousands of families are languishing on social housing waiting lists.

However, if caught these cheats face little more than losing their tenancy.

Mr Harrington's Bill would:

  * create a new criminal offence of subletting; and
  * allow for proceeds of subletting to be reimbursed to the social landlord in whose stock the fraud was committed

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Tenancy cheats profit from renting out homes that were built to help those in greatest need. Due to their actions, thousands of families who could benefit from this vital support system are instead languishing on housing waiting lists.
>
> ""I am delighted that Richard Harrington's Bill will make this fraud a criminal offence so that the perpetrators don't just lose their tenancy but feel the full force of the law. And by introducing this effective deterrent against subletting, we can free up thousands of homes for those who genuinely need them.
>
> ""I look forward to working with Mr Harrington to give this Bill the best possible chance of being passed into law.""

Conservative MP for Watford Richard Harrington said:

> ""It has been a concern of mine for some time that whilst hundreds of people in my constituency are unable to access social housing and may sit on the waiting list for many years, a large number of properties are being sublet improperly - allowing those individuals who do so to profit at the expense of local authorities and preventing hardworking and the most vulnerable individuals and families from accessing homes.
>

More than £100 million is available to get spades in the ground and stalled developments back on track. This will potentially deliver up to 2,000 new homes.

The Get Britain Building fund has already provided a boost to developments in places including Ashford and Bath, where work has now restarted on 181 new homes.

The Minister said he was opening up remaining money in the £570 million Get Britain Building fund so this loan lifeline is also available to smaller builders after other developers later found they could build without the fund.

### Smaller builders getting bigger chance

Previously, builders bidding for cash had to have plans for at least 25 homes on their sites. Now, to help smaller firms bid for funding the Minister has lowered the bar to 15 homes. This will open the door to additional developers who previously could not access this financial support. Larger developers can still bid.

Mr Shapps said he was determined that every taxpayers' pound works as hard as possible and that as many homes as possible are built. That's why the fund provides commercial loans directly to building firms that have shovel-ready sites, with planning permission in place, and that fit with local priorities.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""By spreading the net wider and boosting the number of eligible sites we can offer more help to builders both large and small.
>
> ""We saw huge appetite last time for this funding but some developers later found they could build without the fund. We need to be sure every single pound of taxpayers' money works as hard as it can so we can get as many homes as possible out of Get Britain Building. That is why I'm inviting further bids.
>
> ""We've already started seeing the benefits this is bringing to the industry and the economy as a whole. I now want to see as many firms as possible grabbing this opportunity to get the diggers back on site.""

Increasing opportunities for smaller firms will not only help secure the livelihood of people across the building trade but also offer more opportunities to local trades, from carpenters and plumbers through to people who keep their local housing market moving.

The Get Britain Building fund is one of a number of measures aimed at tackling the housing shortage, boosting the economy, creating jobs and giving people an opportunity to get on the housing ladder. In addition:

  * The Government and the sector is investing £19 billion in its affordable homes programme.
  * FirstBuy, a shared ownership scheme, is expected to help nearly 10,000 buyers onto the housing ladder. NewBuy, a scheme that helps people secure a mortgage with a five per cent deposit is expected to help up to 100,000 households.
  * The £770 million Growing Places Fund is providing local areas with flexible funding to get the infrastructure built to build new homes.

The £570 million Get Britain Building fund was announced at the end of last year and was initially over-subscribed three times. All projects are assessed on a level playing field, regardless of the size of the firm.

The fund is administered by the Homes and Communities Agency, the body responsible for assessing applications.

The agency's chief executive, Pat Ritchie, said:

> ""I'm pleased that we are able to extend the reach of the Get Britain Building programme, giving many more developers who have struggled to secure finance the opportunity to apply for the investment they need to get their stalled projects back on track.
>
> ""As with the original submissions, the HCA will continue to be thorough in our due diligence, and will only support those schemes backed by the community, which boost the local economy and provide a secure and value for money investment for the taxpayer.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is today calling on local people to show their support for high street shopping by visiting one of a host of local markets open across the country on National Market Day (23 June).

Today marks the start of a two week 'Love Your Local Market' extravaganza. Over 300 local markets will be offering special deals and events to attract new shoppers and encourage budding entrepreneurs to start up new businesses by trying out this low-cost way to get into retail.

Over a thousand new start-ups pitches are already booked. Low-cost pitches and 'tables for a tenner' deals mean many more people can set up a stall on the day. Some places will also have expert advice on hand from experienced 'market mentors' offering helpful advice to new traders.

Mr Pickles and Apprentice star, Adam Corbally launched the fortnight at Spitalfields market in London where they met young entrepreneurs from local schools trying their hand at running a market stall and selling their craft goods.

Adam Corbally, formally a market-trader and now a successful businessman, has given his top ten tips for running a market stall. Tips include: get there early; set up near a cafe or toilet for more footfall; get your prices right; and remember smiles and tales make sales. They are part of a new guide to _Getting Started_ as a market trader.

Mr Pickles has urged every council to get behind this ""exciting opportunity"" to support the high street and local economy. The Government has committed over eighty million pounds to give young entrepreneurs start-up loans, personal training and expert support to develop a business plan. This could to create over 30,000 new businesses.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The hustle and bustle of a busy market has long been a great British tradition. Brimming with energetic traders and great deals, local markets should be a vibrant part of every town's shopping experience.
>
> ""Love Your Local Market is going to be a really exciting fortnight for towns and villages across the country - it's a great way to put local economic life back into the high street. Over a thousand new entrepreneurs are taking advantage of the special rates on offer to try out their business ideas.""

Adam Corbally said:

> ""I am really passionate about markets and proud to support this fantastic Love Your Local Market fortnight.
>
> ""My top tips come from the heart and are based on 14 years of trading. They're a straight forward and simple way to do it right - the kind of advice I wish I'd been given when I started out.
>
> ""I hope as many people as possible get stuck in and have a go at running a stall - if I can make it a career so can you - either way, head down to your local market and see what's on offer.""

Minister for Markets Andrew Stunell said:

> ""From Stockport to St. Ives market traders across the country will be showcasing all that is great about our local markets. Some of Britain's biggest household names started off on market stalls and Love Your Local Market could be the fortnight that kick starts a few more budding British businesses.""

First announced as part of the Government's response to Mary Portas' review of the High Street, the Love Your Local Markets fortnight is being run by the National Market Trader Federation and the Markets Alliance.

The builders behind half of all homes built in England are committed to offering the NewBuy Guarantee to help aspiring homeowners onto the property ladder, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

It comes as a new study by lenders Halifax showed that Government help for first-time buyers is bringing down the cost of home ownership, ensuring the dream of buying a property is in reach for more and more people.

Mr Shapps revealed that nine of the 10 largest housebuilders in the country are now signed up to offer the NewBuy Guarantee - which offers aspiring homeowners to buy a new-build property with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require.

The NewBuy Guarantee is one of a number of Government-backed measures in place to support those looking to take their first step onto the property ladder. Others include:

  * The FirstBuy Scheme, which offers an alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad for those struggling to get together the deposit they need. Over 10,000 first-time buyers are expected to be helped over the next two years; and
  * The HomeBuy schemes, which help first-time buyers to buy a 25 per cent share of a new property, paying rent on the remainder.

Today's Halifax Survey shows that the average price paid under affordable home ownership schemes is £161,839 - 12 per cent lower than the average house price in England.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today's research shows how the range of Government schemes available is bringing down the cost of home ownership and making that first rung of the property ladder easier to reach for more and more people.
>
> ""As well as the FirstBuy Scheme offering a valuable alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad, the NewBuy Guarantee is proving increasingly popular, offering those who dream of owning their own home the chance to buy a newly-built property with just a fraction of the deposit normally required.
>
> ""And because both schemes are available on newly-built properties, they also offer a boost to our ongoing efforts to get Britain building, delivering the homes and jobs this country needs.""

Armed Forces Day on 30 June helps raise public awareness of the contribution made to our country by those who serve and have served in Her Majesty's Armed Forces. Mr Pickles is currently looking to relax planning rules on flags to make it easier for the public to fly local military flags to show support for the men and women who make up the community: from currently serving troops to Service families and from veterans to cadets.

At the ceremony of hoisting the Armed Forces flag, Eric Pickles said:

> ""Today, we pay tribute to the bravery of our Armed Forces both in present and historic conflicts.
>
> ""British forces put their lives on the line to defend British sovereign territory, the British way of life and the rights of British people to determine their own future. Flying their flag is our small way of recognising their endeavour.""

The City of Plymouth, with its historic and distinguished links with the military, has been chosen to host the Armed Forces Day national event in 2012. Celebrations on Saturday 30 June will be an opportunity to see the Armed Forces up close and pay tribute to our heroes past and present. Participants will include members of the Armed Forces, veterans, the Cadet Forces, the Merchant Navy, support agencies and charitable organisations.

A leading High Street business is joining forces with Local Government Minister Grant Shapps, and retail guru Mary Portas, to help champion the nation's high streets.

Alex Gourlay, Chief Executive, Boots UK, will offer vital advice and support to Mary Portas and the 12 'Portas Pilots', as they take forward their plans to bring their town centres back to life.

Mr Shapps said this kind of corporate backing would give the Town Teams in these areas access to ""knowledge and expertise built up over decades of experience"".

The British Independent Retailers Association will also work closely with Mary and the Portas Pilots to offer their expertise and support.

More retailers are expected to join forces with Grant Shapps and Mary Portas in the coming weeks and months.

This support will be offered not only to these first 12 winning Portas Pilots but also to the next 15 winning pilots due to be announced before the end of July.

This will be a shot in the arm to the campaign to revive high streets across the country, and comes as the 12 winning Town Teams met with the Minister and Mary Portas for the first time, to share their ideas and gain valuable feedback and advice.

This will be the first in a series of workshops taking place over the coming months, giving all pilots the opportunity to share their ideas and experiences, as well as gaining valuable advice.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Boots is a stalwart of our high streets, with knowledge and expertise that has been developed over decades of experience.
>
> ""Our 12 winning Portas Pilots will be able to tap into this valuable resource as they seek to support their local shops, but also explore other ways that their town centres can become the heart of their communities once again.

> ""I look forward to meeting the town teams and hearing first hand how they plan to use this and the other help at their disposal.""

Mary Portas said:

> ""I'm delighted that our efforts to revive the nation's high streets will be boosted by the knowledge and experience of these leading retailers.

Alex Gourlay, Chief Executive of the Health and Beauty Division of Alliance Boots said:

> ""There has never been a more important time for government and business to take an active interest in how local high streets are run and managed. These 12 towns will be delighted to hear the news that they have been selected.

""Mary Portas has brought a personal energy and drive to the programme which can only benefit the 12 pilot towns. Business in the Community has brought a number of us together to discuss how we can help Mary and her team and we'll continue to explore what practical means of support we can give.""

The Community Right to Challenge hands more power back to communities, allowing voluntary and community groups, parish councils and local authority staff to express an interest in taking over the running of local authority services, making services more responsive to local needs and delivering better value for money.

Also from today a range of specialist support is being put in place to help community groups wanting to take greater control of their community through every stage of the process - from setting up a group and developing a proposal right through to the delivering services on the ground.

The Social Investment Business, in partnership with Locality and the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations will deliver a three year support programme worth £11.5million. The programme will include a dedicated advice phone line where support and information will be available. It will also include grants to help groups to use the new right and bid to run local public services, resources, and case studies.

Some examples of community groups already providing excellent local services include:

> **Bulky Bob's** - a social enterprise that has contracts with Liverpool City Council and others to collect, reuse and recycle bulky household waste. 70 per cent of the furniture and white goods collected are recycled or reused, helping over 34,000 low-income families gain access to affordable, 'pre-loved' furniture and a huge saving for councils in landfill tax.
>
> **Shiney Advice and Resource Project (ShARP)** - is an independent welfare rights advice centre based in Sunderland. Run as a charity it provides basic advice on debt, welfare benefits, housing and employment. Many of ShARP's users are vulnerable adults or people in stressful situations. Sunderland City Council has recently renewed its contract with ShARP to provide key advice to the Shiney Row, Houghton and Hetton wards of Sunderland.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Community Right to Challenge gives communities another opportunity to be the driving force in the future of their local services. As the people who know their communities best and use and rely upon local services it makes sense, that where they feel they can run services better, they should be encouraged and supported to step in and do exactly that.
>
> ""Already we have seen some excellent achievements from local people taking the reins, and with these revolutionary rights now in place we can look forward to more communities getting involved in making their local areas better places to live.""

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""The Community Right to Challenge paves the way for communities to play a bigger part in shaping excellent local services around their needs.
>
> ""Councils do not have to have a monopoly over the best ideas and the most creative are already welcoming innovative ideas from communities about how services can be reformed and improved to better meet local need.
>
> ""This marks the next step in returning power back to citizens, communities and local groups to manage their own affairs free from Whitehall interference.""

Jonathan Jenkins, Chief Executive, Social Investment Business said:

> ""The Right to Challenge presents a fantastic new opportunity for social ventures to grow through increased revenue, and therefore build their capacity to secure further investment - all with the goal of being able to reach more beneficiaries.""

Steve Wyler, Chief Executive, Locality said:

> ""We are delighted that the Community Right to Challenge is coming into force, having pushed hard to make the Localism Act a reality. The Community Right to Challenge will give communities the impetus to suggest and put in place new ways of delivering services - meeting the needs of residents, employing local people and creating resilient community enterprises. Locality supports local people to run local services as the best way to deliver economic and social change.""

Mohamed Aslam MBE, BEM, Director, Himmat Limited a community-led organisation based in Halifax said:

> ""At Himmat, we have expanded from our original base of Halifax to deliver services elsewhere in West Yorkshire. As a community-led organisation, we have been successful in being awarded contracts to run services such as with the local Youth Offending Team. It hasn't been straightforward establishing ourselves - we're lucky to have strong relationships with our local authority. The new Community Right to Challenge will make it easier for community organisations to suggest new ways of running council services. The 95 per cent attendance record at our Youth Offending Team programme is evidence that community organisations deliver results.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Community Right to Challenge was introduced by the Localism Act 2011 which was enacted on 15 November 2011. Regulations were laid in Parliament on 30 April and 17 May 2012. _A plain English guide to the Localism Act_ is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localismplainenglishupdate](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localismplainenglishupdate).

2. Under the Community Right to Challenge, relevant authorities (county, district and London Borough councils and fire and rescue authorities) must consider expressions of interest and, where they accept an expression of interest, carry out a procurement exercise for the service.

3. A Community Rights website has been launched to give people more information about the new powers and opportunities available to them.

In the drive for greater transparency across all Government, from 1 July, councillors will be required to register certain pecuniary interests, including trade union dealings on a publicly available register. Deliberate failure to declare interests could result in a criminal conviction.

These new measures, outlined in the Localism Act, will replace the bureaucratic and controversial Standards Board regime, which ministers believe had become a system of nuisance complaints and petty, sometimes malicious, allegations of councillor misconduct that sapped public confidence in local democracy. The old regime also raised concerns that it discouraged councillors from whistle-blowing or criticising waste and inefficiency in local government, as it opened them up to complaints by local authority officers.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""The Standards Board regime led to an explosion in petty, partisan and malicious complaints that dragged down the reputation of local government, as well as suppressing freedom of speech.
>
> ""Our reforms take a tough stance on council corruption by making serious misconduct a criminal offence, accompanied by the sunlight of transparency on financial and union interests. Such reforms will give local people the confidence that councillors are putting local residents' interests first.""

### Notes to Editors

1. The new arrangements coming into force on 1 July include a code of conduct based on 'Nolan principles', the involvement of an independent person in allegations of misconduct, a register of members' pecuniary interests, and a new criminal offence for failing to declare or register pecuniary interests.

2. The register of interests regulations in force from 1 July for local authority members are in the Localism Act (sections 29 to 34) which received Royal Assent last November.

3. The regulations set out the rules for disclosure and registration of pecuniary interests, which may limit a councillor's involvement with the business of the authority, where failure to comply with the rules without reasonable excuse is a criminal offence, punishable with a fine of up to £5,000 and disqualification from office for up to five years.

4. Pecuniary interests cover the member's 'employment, office, trade, profession or vocation', any 'sponsorship' of the member, including contributions towards their election expenses, any 'contracts' between the member and the authority, any 'land' the member has an interest in and lies within the area of the authority, any 'licences' the member holds to occupy land in the area, any 'corporate tenancies', and certain 'securities' the member may hold.

5. The new arrangements explicitly state any payment or financial benefit from a trade union must also be declared.

6. The new arrangements reflect the Government's policy that elected representatives should continue to declare financial interests in an open and transparent way, to avoid conflicts of interest especially on issues such as planning applications or financially benefiting from the issuing of council contracts.",28-Jun-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The families of those killed in the line of duty will be at the front of the queue for social housing, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The Minister outlined how a change to the law will give top priority for homes not just to members of the Armed Forces with pressing housing needs, but also to their loved ones if anything happens to them.

Former servicemen and women, and those members of the Reserve Forces injured in action, will also be placed first in line if they have an urgent need for social housing.

### Security when it's needed most

The Minister said that the reforms announced today would ensure that those who have risked their lives for our country - and their families - would have the security they need at the most difficult times.

In the past, members of the Armed Forces could be pushed towards the bottom of local waiting lists as the nature of their job and the need to move from base to base often meant they couldn't prove the local connection to the area they wanted to live in.

But changes announced today in new guidance for local councils will ensure that an exception is made for military families, so that they are not at this disadvantage when applying for a council home.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This nation's heroes, serving in military hotspots around the world, put their lives on the line for us on a daily basis and it's only right that we should have the support in place for them and their loved ones when they need it most.
>
> ""That's why I'm ending the unfair treatment of military families on the waiting list. But I want to be sure that the safety net of social housing is not just there for those serving our country, but also the families that support them. So today, I'm planning for the first time to extend this help to those who lose loved ones on the front line, as well as men and women injured in the line of duty.""

### Tackling the tick-box culture

Mr Shapps said he also wants to end the perception that council houses are only available to those willing to play the system. Today's new guidance will also give councils and housing associations more freedom to use their discretion to reward ambition and achievement - ensuring homes go to the most in need such as hard working families - instead of those who merely know how to tick the most boxes.

So today's new guidance gives councils greater flexibility and encouragement to:

  * stop prospective tenants who already own another property from benefiting from a council property they don't need;
  * support those who are willing to provide a loving home for children - whether they are adopters or fosterers, or other family and friend carers, and
  * offer tailored advice and support to those whose housing needs may be better met by private rented and other forms of housing, and who may not qualify to join the local social housing waiting list.

This is part of a series of radical reforms that the Government has made to ensure the precious resource of social housing is used most effectively, Other measures include:

  * giving councils more flexibility over tenure rules, so that housing can be offered to those who need it most, when they need it;
  * giving more freedom to councils to help homeless households by offering suitable private sector accommodation;
  * introducing HomeSwap Direct, helping tenants to see potential home-swaps in every part of the country; and
  * reforming council house financing, so that councils can keep their rents and plan ahead to maintain their homes.
  * stopping paying for empty rooms, in order to focus on bringing down waiting lists which doubled under the last Administration.

On 28 June, the Government published an _Overseas Territories White Paper_; one of the goals is to raise awareness in the United Kingdom of these British communities, lands and seas around the world.

Mr Pickles has asked for the flags of the United Kingdom's Overseas Territories - from Anguilla to the Turks and Caicos Islands - to be proudly flown by the Department as part of a formal recognition of the continued important and close relationship with the country. This follows from a programme of flying England's county flags last year. The Cayman Islands' flag is being flown alongside the United Kingdom's Union flag, which is flown all year round.

The flags will be flown at appropriate times in the coming months to recognise national days of significance. Britain has 14 Overseas Territories which encompass over 600,000 square miles and are home to 260,000 people - more than Nottingham or Newcastle. The Department provides advice and guidance to Territory Governments in areas where it has relevant expertise - in particular planning, housing, and fire safety and rescue services.

First noted by Christopher Columbus in 1503, the Cayman Islands are a major world financial centre whilst its famous Seven Mile Beach is a renowned tourist attraction. The Cayman Island flag design includes their coat of arms which features a pineapple and turtle above a shield with three stars (representing the three islands) and a scroll at the bottom bearing the national motto, 'He hath founded it upon the seas'.

At the ceremony of hoisting the Cayman Islands flag, Eric Pickles said:

> ""I'm delighted to see the flag of the Cayman Islands flying proudly outside my Department. British Overseas Territories play a vital role in our sense of national identity and the Government's vision is for the Territories to be vibrant and flourishing communities, proudly retaining aspects of their British identity and generating wider opportunities for their people.
>
> ""I look forward to seeing many more flags of the UK's overseas territories flying in the coming months especially in this year of celebration.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is currently assessing responses to a discussion paper on relaxing the planning regime on flag flying and allowing people to fly more flags without having to seek and pay for planning consent from their local authority.

2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office published a white paper on Overseas Territories on 28 June setting out its overall approach to the Overseas Territories. It can be found here: [www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/overseas-territories/overseas-territories-white-paper/](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/overseas-territories/overseas-territories-white-paper/) (external link).

Well over 100 councils across England have seized the opportunity to use cash proceeds from the reinvigorated Right to Buy to help meet the housing needs of hard working local families, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The revamped Right to Buy, launched in April, offers England's 2.5 million council tenants discounts of up to £75,000 when buying their home - tripling the discount in many parts of the country, and quadrupling it in London.

For the first time, every extra council property sold under the scheme will be replaced by a new affordable home for rent.

### Council freedom to build

Today the Minister revealed that of the 167 councils which retain housing stock, more than two thirds (120) have already signed up to a one-for-one deal that allows them to keep the receipts from their additional Right to Buy sales.

This agreement will give them the freedom to:

  * decide on the type, size and location of the new homes they build according to local needs; and
  * work with other organisations such as housing associations to ensure the additional affordable homes are built in their area.

The remaining 47 councils yet to sign an agreement will have to pass their additional receipts into a central pot from which they will be able to bid for funding to invest in affordable homes.

But Mr Shapps stressed the door would still be open for these councils to sign up to use Right to Buy cash to build new homes in their area. Those who sign up by September will be able to keep receipts from July sales onward.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The reinvigorated Right to Buy has given hope back to thousands of aspiring council tenants who want to own their home - and for the first time, every extra home sold will be replaced on a one for one basis.
>
> ""So I'm pleased that 120 councils have seized this prime opportunity to refresh their housing stock by signing up to keep the cash from sales in their area.
>
> ""Not only will they be able to hand the keys to home ownership to their existing tenants, they will also be able to help families who for too long have been left languishing on their waiting lists.""

### Notes to editors

1. The councils that have already signed up to deliver one-for-one replacement locally are:


2. Additional Right to Buy receipts from the 47 councils that have not signed up to the one-for-one deal will be returned to the Homes and Communities Agency - or the Greater London Authority in London.



3. To ensure best value for taxpayers' money Right to Buy funds should account for no more than 30 per cent of the total spend on new homes - in line with the highly successful Affordable Homes Programme, which is expected to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015.

4. The cash raised from Right to Buy sales must be spent on new affordable homes for rent within three years of first receiving it. If the money remains unspent after three years it will be returned to Whitehall to be invested nationally in more housebuilding.

350,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2171515,DCLG Annual Report and Accounts published,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"The Department for Communities and Local Government has published its [Annual Report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/annualreport1112) and, for the first time, consolidated Group Accounts for the 2011-12 financial year.

The Annual report and accounts provides an overview of the Department's performance in 2011-12, structured around the five Coalition Priorities set out in the [Business Plan](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/businessplan2012), and the role the Department is playing in reducing the deficit.

Key achievements highlighted in the annual report include:

  * Passing the **Localism Act** - the most radical shift in power for a generation, giving local people powerful new rights to run services and help shape planning in their neighbourhoods. It also reduced regulatory costs to business by £14m per year.
  * Introducing the **National Planning Policy Framework** - reducing nearly 1,300 pages of guidance to around 50 pages.
  * Our far-reaching **Housing Strategy** - setting out how we will make housing more affordable, support new building and tackle empty homes.
  * The **transfer of powers to London**, and completion of **City Deals** to other core cities.
  * Responded to the August 2011 public disorder with a **package of support to help with recovery**.
  * Our **Local Government Finance Bill** to support local economic growth, letting councils keep part of their business rates to support local firms and jobs. In addition 14 Community Budget pilots have been established.
  * Proposals to turn around the lives of 120,000 **troubled families**.
  * Set aside up to £250m for a **weekly waste collection support scheme**.
  * Setting up 24 **Enterprise Zones**, with business rate discounts and simplified planning.
  * Supporting to **Local Enterprise Partnerships**, setting up £730m **Growing Places Fund**.

All this was set against the need to tackle the record budget deficit whilst implementing the Department's own reductions which include a 33 per cent saving in real terms on administration costs and a 37 per cent workforce reduction. The Department made £190m saving by completing abolition of Government Offices for the Regions and disbanding the Audit Commission which is expected to save a further £650m. Nine other arms length bodies have been closed.

The Department's core budget over the current Spending Review period is now £18.3bn, an increase from £16.2bn at the beginning of 2011-12, as a result of additional funding being provided to support troubled families, the Growing Places Fund, the Regional Growth Fund and other new or expanded programmes.

The report follows the publication of the Department's latest transparency information which included:

  * An [Open Data Strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/opendata201214) which identifies how the department will drive reform and service improvement through transparency and greater participation from citizens, communities, partner groups and small businesses. This will help improve how citizens hold governments to account
  * [Senior employee salaries](http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/transparencyingovernment/staffdata/seniorstaffsalaries/) which shows the latest details of consenting senior departmental staff earning a full-time salary over £58,200 in line with _The Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency_.
  * A list which shows [companies that DCLG (Homes and Communities Agency) has interests in](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/2171425.pdf).
  * The [spending data from May](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/spendingdatamay12). The Department has been matching the level required of councils since August 2010.

The package of measures includes proposals to make it easier to re-use some existing buildings without needing planning permission including the so-called 'meanwhile' use of vacant commercial buildings; streamlining the amount of paperwork needed for a planning application; speeding up planning appeal decisions; reducing the volume of planning guidance; and ensuring planning departments are properly resourced to assess applications promptly and efficiently, reducing the burden on council taxpayers.

The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.

For example, the rate at which councils are putting in place a local plan is increasing in comparison to the average over the previous seven years and over 100 local authorities are now working with front-runner communities on neighbourhood planning.

Today's proposals will help to maintain the rapid pace of reform by removing unnecessary barriers, streamlining paperwork, and supporting swifter decision making.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Our reforms to the planning system are making it simpler, clearer and more accessible to people in communities.
>
> ""Following the simplification of the national planning policy in the National Planning Policy Framework, these proposed changes streamline the process of applying for planning permission.
>
> ""Our aim is to have a system that applicants and members of communities can be confident will give a reliable, swift and fair outcome.""

The measures include:

  * Making it easier to re-use existing agricultural, retail and commercial buildings, such as offices and warehouses, without the need to submit a planning application, supporting small business growth. A consultation is being published on changes to the Use Classes Order, which determines the flexibility with which such buildings can be re-used. The consultation also proposes allowing so called 'meanwhile' or temporary uses of certain buildings to open up premises to new businesses and to bring redundant buildings back into use, in line with recommendations in the Portas Review.
  * Cutting out unnecessary information in the application process to make the system clearer, and easier to use, without undermining the ability for councils to make well-informed decisions. A consultation setting out proposals is being published today.
  * Following the approach of the National Planning Policy Framework in distilling 1,000 pages of policy into around 50, the next challenge is to review around 6,000 pages of supporting planning guidance. Details of the approach to be taken will be announced shortly.
  * Speeding up the process for determining planning appeals - proposals on shortening and streamlining the process will be published for consultation later this year.
  * Uprating local councils' planning fees in line with inflation thereby reducing the burden on ordinary council taxpayers, who otherwise end up subsidising developers. Planning fees are set by Government and have not been increased since 2008.
  * Ensuring councils whose planning decisions are consistent with an up to date local plan are not ordinarily liable for costs if their decision is appealed.
  * Making technical changes to the operation of the Community Infrastructure Levy including ensuring that developers are not charged the levy twice, on the same development, if they amend existing planning consent.
  * Extending the funding to April 2013 to the four organisations providing advice and support to communities leading the way on neighbourhood planning.

3. Community Infrastructure Levy allows local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from owners or developers of land undertaking new building projects in their area. The money can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development, including new or safer road schemes, flood defences, park improvements, green spaces and leisure centres. The Government will introduce regulatory changes in the Autumn to improve the operation of the levy.

4. The Government is proposing to improve the performance of statutory consultees in the planning process by ensuring that there is an effective mechanism for applicants to obtain an award of costs where a statutory consultee has acted unreasonably. A consultation with detailed proposals is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation).

_Alcohol Lessons for Life_ - delivered by Coram Life Education and supported by a grant from the High Sheriff Youth Awards scheme - addresses the problems alcohol can create for young people, parents, families and their local communities.

![Baroness Newlove with pupils from Bansted Community School](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2172119.jpg)
Baroness Newlove and pupils from Bansted Community school

Targeting Year 6 pupils approaching secondary school age, the programme covers the health risks and the anti-social behaviour that problem and binge drinking causes. The children are asked to present their findings as part of an interactive assembly for their parents to which school governors, neighbourhood police, councillors, local business people and neighbouring schools are also invited. The programme has been successfully piloted in primary schools across Surrey and funding has been extended for this year.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I was delighted to see this innovative alcohol education programme which works with primary school children, their parents and teachers. It is never too early to start addressing negative issues around underage and binge drinking and it was refreshing to hear from the children themselves how they view their world, and what their solutions would be. We need to work together as a community, agencies and public, young and old to build, safe happy places for us all to live, work, and play in. In time, I'd like to see this fresh approach rolled out across the country.""

340,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2174012,Cities' economic power unlocked in radical power shift,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"Government has agreed to devolve new powers to England's largest cities in a series of unique deals that will help them invest in growth, improve local workers' skills and create jobs, support local businesses, control budgets and improve critical infrastructure Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Cities Minister Greg Clark announced today.

The core cities are Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. These eight largest and most economically important English cities outside of London were invited to set out the powers they need to drive local growth in December last year. In return the cities have agreed to put in place stronger, more accountable local leadership and to spend their resources more efficiently. The resulting groundbreaking agreements signal a dramatic shift, freeing cities from Whitehall control.

Following Greater Manchester's example, Leeds and Sheffield will each form Combined Authorities, bringing their existing local authorities together so they can make more strategic decisions about how money is spent and what it is spent on. Liverpool and Bristol have voted to have directly elected mayors supported by strong decision making structures across the wider economic area. Leeds will form a West Yorkshire Combined Authority and Sheffield will form the South Yorkshire Combined Authority.

Newcastle is working with the seven authorities across their economic area to take steps towards forming a North East Combined Authority; Greater Birmingham and Solihull has established strong private sector leadership and decision-making across its Local Enterprise Partnership. And Nottingham has created a new private sector-led governance structure to deliver their City Deal.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

> ""These groundbreaking deals signal a dramatic power shift, freeing cities from Whitehall control. Everyone in these eight core cities will feel the benefits - from young people looking for jobs, to businesses looking to expand.
>
> ""Over the coming months, we are transferring more and more power from Whitehall to these cities.
>
> ""They are the economic powerhouses of England - so it makes sense that the cities decide for themselves how to boost their local economies.""

Cities Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""City deals represent a watershed moment in the Government's revolution to hand power down from Whitehall to the local level.
>
> ""These landmark agreements will unlock the huge potential of our cities by harnessing their unique strengths to drive the growth Britain needs.
>
> ""Our major cities have seized the opportunity to take control of their economic destiny and will now reap the benefits of new financial freedoms and investment opportunities available to them.
>
> ""Now we have concluded the first deals, we will shortly set out next steps for this radical extension of power to other places across the country.""

The deals give new freedoms, powers and tools to help the cities go for growth, including:

> **More power to invest in growth**

  * Powers to 'earn back' tax from the HM Treasury for Manchester
  * Freedom to fund critical infrastructure through tax increment financing for Newcastle, Sheffield and Nottingham
  * Self-sustaining investment funds to spend on local priority projects, reducing dependence on grants from central government for Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield

> **More freedom to support local businesses**

  * Power to create a venture capital fund to invest in high tech start ups and growth businesses for Nottingham
  * Business Growth hubs bringing support, advice and services to help businesses grow for Manchester and Bristol

> **More power over budgets and resources to drive infrastructure development**

  * Devolved transport budgets for Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds and Sheffield
  * Responsibility for commissioning and managing franchise arrangements for local and regional rail services devolved to Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield
  * Joint investment programmes bringing together private and public sector assets to unlock resources for housing development and regeneration

> **Powers to deliver the skills training local people and businesses need**

  * Control of the skills budget so the city can better respond to what businesses need from the local workforce for Sheffield
  * Apprenticeship hubs for Bristol, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle and Nottingham, enabling the cities to boost apprenticeship numbers by supporting small and medium sized businesses to take on more apprentices with measures such as incentive payments

A 'Guarantee for the Young', with innovative new ways to give every young person access to a job, training, apprenticeship, volunteering or work experience for Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle.

The deal is real proof that by working with city regions and business leaders, Government can give local areas the right tools they need to support economic growth and create jobs.
>

>
> ""This deal means we can change all that by making the skills system work for our economy, for our communities and for our businesses.
>
> ""With local businesses in the lead, this deal means that there'll be 4,000 new apprentices working in the City Region by 2016, getting the skills they need for a successful career.

> ""Our transport deal will ensure that our workforce can travel faster, smarter and more efficiently. This deal is essential to achieving our growth potential and devolves the power to make transport decisions which focus on growing the City Region's economy.""

John Mothersole, Chief Executive of Sheffield City Council:

> ""This is a groundbreaking deal for Sheffield City Region which reflects our position as a lead partner of Government in delivering the jobs and growth that the UK needs.
>
> ""The proposals in our deal signal an unprecedented shift in control away from Whitehall and are a major step on the road to giving cities the tools they need to facilitate sustainable economic growth. With greater control over skills, infrastructure investment and transport, Sheffield City Region increasingly has control over the economic enablers which create growth opportunities. Using our strong, accountable governance arrangements, we can now make decisions based on local economic need.
>
> ""We welcome the announcement of the 'MADE in Sheffield' deal and the advent of a new, stronger relationship between Sheffield City Region and Government based on mutual trust, strong public and private leadership and shared aspirations.""

Under the £19 million Community Ownership of Assets programme communities wanting to take control of a much loved local asset will have access to support they need through each stage of the process from forming a group through to preparing and submitting a bid. The programme will also help communities use the Right to Bid when it comes into force this Autumn.

Under the £11.5 million Community Right to Challenge programme - which became law last week - communities with good ideas for how they can run local public services and want to use the Community Right to Challenge, can access advice and support to develop their skills to be able to bid for and run excellent local services.

Around 90 per cent of the funding will go directly to communities in the form of grants allowing them to buy the support they need. In addition to this, funding will support a website and advice service [www.mycommunityrights.org.uk](http://mycommunityrights.org.uk/community-right-to-challenge/) (external link) and telephone helpline run by Locality, with the grants programme provided by the Social Investment Business.

Mr Stunell was speaking at Hebden Bridge Town Hall, which has been brought back to the centre of community life following its transfer into community ownership from Calderdale Council. A major new extension to the building - hosting brand new community and enterprise facilities - has just opened through the fundraising efforts of the Hebden Bridge Community Association.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""We have all heard about much-loved community assets being sold off with out anyone locally having a say, let alone given the time to get a decent plan together. And many groups who felt they could run council services better, by doing things differently, have simply been overlooked.
>
> ""Taking over assets and running services isn't easy. As well as dedication, groups need skills, support and funding to get projects off the ground. But with the right backing, it's not as daunting as it first seems and communities up and down the country are showing that taking ownership of assets and services can work for the benefit of everyone.
>
> ""Hebden Bridge Town Hall is testament to that and we want more communities to get a fair hearing and the chance to bid to take control of the buildings or run services that are important to them.""

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Local people often have great ideas about how to run their communities, but can struggle to have their voices heard.
>
> ""These powerful new rights will give communities the ability to challenge the status quo, and do things differently to improve the places where they live.
>
> ""This support will help people to take advantage of the rights available and use them to shape a vision for their neighbourhood.""

Steve Wyler, Locality Chief Executive, said:

> ""Locality has believed in and pushed for the new Rights in the Localism Act for many years and is very proud to be running the Community Rights support service. These Rights give greater powers to communities to influence what happens in their local area, avoiding complicated legislation and lengthy negotiations.
>
> ""These Rights are for everyone who cares about their community, who value their local community centre, shop or pub; want to build new housing or facilities, and run a local service differently and better. Locality is here to give people information, inspiration, ideas and advice from our team of Community Rights experts and to see communities across the UK transformed.""

Jonathan Jenkins, Chief Executive of the Social Investment Business said:

> ""The Community Rights grants programme presents a fantastic new opportunity for social ventures to grow through increased revenue, and therefore build their capacity to secure further investment - all with the goal of being able to reach more beneficiaries.""

### Notes to editors

1. The new Community Rights give communities opportunities to take ownership and management of important local assets and to shape and run local public services. The Community Right to Challenge - which became law last week - gives communities the right to bid to run local council services where they think they can do it differently and better. The Community Right to Bid - which will become law in the autumn and complements existing asset transfer activity - will give communities the right to bid to buy and take over the running of local assets that are important to them.

2. These two 3 year funding programmes will run until March 2015. Groups will also be able to apply for grants under the Right to Challenge from 16 July. More details on the grants programme to support community ownership of assets will be available soon.

3. A Community Rights website has been launched to give groups more information about the new powers and opportunities available to them. The website will continue to grow and expand as more of the Rights come into force. The site can be viewed here: [www.mycommunityrights.org.uk](http://mycommunityrights.org.uk/community-right-to-challenge/) (external link).

4. The telephone advice support can be contacted on: 0845 345 4564.

Some other examples of community groups who have already taken ownership include:

The Trust has renovated the lower floor as a modern building to be used by the whole community, while a new doctors surgery occupies the refurbished upper floor.

**Diss Corn Hall Trust, Diss Norfolk** - A group of volunteers set up a charity, the Diss Corn Hall Trust, Diss Norfolk and took over management of the Corn Hall from the Town Council, turning it into a vibrant centre for arts, culture, music and drama in the South Norfolk/North Suffolk area and increasing attendance from 3,500 to 15,000 in just two years.

![Andrew Stunell speaking at Moor Market in Sheffield](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2175287.jpg)Andrew Stunell speaking at the turf-cutting ceremony

As a celebratory, closing event for the Love Your Local Markets fortnight, Mr Stunell saw work getting under way on the city's new multi-million pound market that is the only purpose-built market under construction in the UK.

The new £18 million market is due to open next year and will house over 200 stalls and eight permanent shopping units. Alongside the market, investment in the surrounding area will also see improved paving, seating and a green face-lift with new plants and flowers.

Markets Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""This new development shows there is a real appetite amongst consumers for the authentic market experience - seeing the produce, bartering for a good price and chatting to your friendly stall owner.
>
> ""Love Your Local Market fortnight has been a great success in highlighting how markets can breathe life back into town and city centres and visiting this new grand development is the perfect way to finish. It will be a credit to the city of Sheffield for years to come.""

Leader of Sheffield Council, Councillor Julie Dore said:

> ""This marks a very exciting new chapter in the 800 year history of markets in Sheffield. Our market has one of the highest concentrations of small businesses in the city and the new hall underlines our commitment to helping them succeed.
>
> ""The new development will reinforce The Moor's position as one of Sheffield's main shopping areas. While work is going on it's business as usual for The Moor and we will try to keep disruption to a minimum. The second phase of The Moor's transformation has begun and we trust shoppers will bear with us during this time.""

Love Your Local Market has been a two-week campaign that has seen over 400 local markets will involved in celebrations all over the country, attracting visitors into towns, helping new start-ups and boosting enterprise. Star of TV's Apprentice, Adam Corbally, has given traders his [Top 10 tips](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2146931) for success and Government ministers have been visiting their local markets.

The two weeks of trading have also seen thousands of budding entrepreneurs and shopkeepers try their hand at operating a low-cost retail business at markets as thousands of extra low-cost pitches were made available.

334,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2174814,Local Audit Bill to create robust new regime and help save taxpayer £650 million,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"A new local audit regime that delivers value for money, greater responsibility for local bodies and the same tough audit standards was set out in draft legislation today by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.

Mr Pickles said the proposed legislation would ensure that councils continue to deliver high quality services while stripping out the bureaucracy and expense of the previous centralised regime.

This is the next step in a series of reforms already underway to replace the Audit Commission with a new local audit framework. The Government's decision to close the Commission and ask it to outsource all of its work to the private sector has already reduced audit fees by a massive 40 per cent.

These reforms are set to save the public purse £650 million over the next five years. They are part of a new approach to local accountability, where councils are held to account by local people rather than answering to central government and support each other to improve.

Under the reforms:

  * Local bodies will be able to appoint their own auditors from an open and competitive market
  * Oversight by the National Audit Office, Financial Reporting Council and professional accountancy bodies will ensure that high standards of auditing continue; and
  * The Audit Commission 'topslice' - adding an extra service charge onto local bodies' audit fees - will be a thing of the past.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Today's draft Bill will recast local audit - making councils more accountable to local citizens, stripping out unnecessary bureaucratic costs, and letting councils appoint their own auditors from an open, competitive market.
>
> ""By replacing the centralised Audit Commission with a more streamlined and transparent system we will save the public purse £650 million over the next five years. But we are determined to ensure that councils continue to deliver the high quality service their residents deserve, which is why our new framework will uphold the tough standards of auditing we expect.""

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Whitehall is taking yet another step back and handing more responsibility to councils. Town halls are already taking ownership of their accountability - publishing details of their spending, structures and decisions - so it's clear they are more than capable of appointing their own auditors.
>
> ""The new regime we're proposing today will offer a better, more efficient and transparent audit system that offers best value for money for the taxpayers it serves.""

Ian Carruthers, Policy and Technical Director at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA), said:

> ""The draft bill provides welcome clarity on the overall shape of the future local public audit regime, as well as the role of qualified professionals within this. CIPFA will continue to work with partners to develop practical supporting arrangements for the new regime.""

Alongside the draft Bill, the Government is also publishing proposals for the proportionate audit of smaller local public bodies such as parish councils. This will include the option to have an auditor appointed by an independent body. Those bodies with an annual turnover below £25,000 will no longer be subject to external audit. These, and the majority of all smaller bodies, will instead be held to account through new transparency requirements.

### Notes to Editors

1. The draft Local Audit Bill is available on the DCLG website at: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/futurelocalaudit/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/futurelocalaudit/). It is also available on the Parliament website at: [www.parliament.uk/business/bills-and-legislation/draft-bills/](http://www.parliament.uk/business/bills-and-legislation/draft-bills/) (external link).

2. The draft Bill has been published for consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny. The consultation on the draft Local Audit Bill runs until 31 August 2012.

3. Further details about the consultation and how to respond can be found at Annex A of the command paper in which the draft Bill is published. A response form is available on our website.

4. The consultation stage impact assessment published alongside the draft Local Audit Bill estimates that the full programme of reforms will save more than £1.1 billion, of which more than £650 million will be realised in the next five years.

5. The main provisions in the draft Local Audit Bill are:

  * The repeal of legislation setting up the Audit Commission (the Audit Commission Act 1998) and provision to transfer assets, liabilities and continuing functions to other bodies.
  * A requirement on local public bodies to appoint an external and independent auditor on the advice of an independent auditor panel.
  * The creation of a new regulatory framework for local public audit, whereby the Financial Reporting Council and professional accountancy bodies would regulate the provision of local public audit services.
  * The transfer of responsibility for setting the high level Code of Audit Practice to the National Audit Office.
  * Powers for the National Audit Office to undertake studies of thematic value for money issues relating to local government, and to access information needed to do so.

6. The proposals for the audit arrangements for smaller local public bodies are published alongside the draft Local Audit Bill. The key elements are:

  * A proportionate regulatory regime, and retention of the current 'limited assurance' version of audit, which the National Audit Office will set out in a Schedule to the Code of Audit Practice.
  * Giving smaller bodies the option of having the procurement and appointment of their audit services carried out by a sector-led body, following a proposal from the National Association of Local Councils and Society of Local Council Clerks to establish such a body. Details of their proposal can be found at: [www.nalc.gov.uk/Latest_News/Media_Release_31_May_2012.aspx](http://www.nalc.gov.uk/Latest_News/Media_Release_31_May_2012.aspx) (external link).
  * Those bodies with turnover below £25,000 will no longer be subject to external audit. This will be counterbalanced by new transparency requirements for all smaller bodies with turnover below £200,000, and local people will still be able to raise objections and have complaints investigated by an auditor if deemed appropriate.

7. In July 2011 the Government asked the Audit Commission to outsource its in-house practice to the private sector. As a result of outsourcing, local bodies should expect audit fee reductions of 40 per cent from 2012/13.

328,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2175438,UK's first self-build community to fast-track new homes,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,grant-shapps,,"Dedicated land and £30 million fund will offer tailor-made support for self build groups

Plans for the nation's first ever dedicated large-scale self building community were given the green light today by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

Mr Shapps announced a wide package for aspiring self builders, offering exclusive access to £30 million funding and Government-owned land to help them turn their housebuilding dreams into a reality.

The move is part of wider efforts to help double the size of the self-build sector - with backing from experts including Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud, who has agreed to be the industry's champion.

The Minister named seven sites across the country being set aside specifically for groups of people looking to work together to build their own homes. These sites, together with many more opportunities being identified by local authorities, will create hundreds of new self build opportunities across the country.

He also praised the work of councils including Cherwell District Council, who are looking to give as many local people as possible the opportunity to build their own homes - including on dedicated sites.

And with Datamonitor predicting that the numbers of mortgages available to self-builders will increase by 141 per cent over coming years, Mr Shapps today wrote to major lenders urging them to consider how they can make the most of the business opportunity that a growing self-build sector can offer.

### Government land to host nation's first self build communities

Today, he announced that enough surplus previously-used public sector land for up to 60 homes will be made available in Trevenson Park, Pool, Cornwall - making it the nation's first-ever large-scale self-build plot.

He also confirmed that six other sites are being made available. They are:

  * Kingsweir and Torpoint, Bristol
  * Spencers Park, Hemel Hempstead
  * Pleasley Colliery, Bolsover
  * Upper Tuesley Milford, Surrey
  * Wilson Road, Hanford, Stoke-on-Trent; and
  * Chase Avenue, Walton Park, Milton Keynes

This is just the first step in a self-build surge. Mr Shapps has also asked the Homes and Communities Agency to continue identifying sites to be dedicated to group self build projects.

The move follows the Minister's recent mission to Almere in the Netherlands - Europe's largest low-cost self-build project. There, he was able to see the difference that can be made when a council gives help to local aspiring self-builders.

He praised the work of Cherwell District Council in Oxfordshire, who are following Almere's lead by offering specific sites to local people looking to build their own home.

As councils across the country draw up their local plans for development, Mr Shapps urged them to follow Cherwell's example and consider the needs of self-builders in their area.

### Financial support for self build start-ups

In addition to offering land, Grant Shapps also published details of a new £30 million investment fund to offer people the money they need to lay the foundations for their self-build projects - the first time this has been done in the UK.

This new fund will offer short term loans to community groups, builders and other small organisations looking to start self-build projects.

The money could be used to pay up to 75 per cent of a project's land and early construction costs, and will be available to organisations planning to build five or more homes at a total cost of up to £3 million.

In his letter to lenders, he highlighted a new 'toolkit' from the Building Societies Association, which provides information and advice to lenders looking to expand into this growing market.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""We are witnessing a self-build surge in this country, with more people than ever looking to construct their own home. As I saw for myself in Almere, the self-build capital of Europe, this shouldn't be a niche interest for the select few - anyone with a dream to build should be able to do so.
>
> ""So I'm delighted to be able to announce the first seven sites with plots available exclusively for self-builders, as well as £30 million to offer short-term loans to help communities get their projects off the ground.
>
> ""This first-ever package of self-build support will help to achieve our goal to double the size of the industry over the next few years, but I want us to go further still. The new national planning rules require councils to consider the needs of self-builders in their area, and I would urge authorities across the country to look to Cherwell and the innovative work there as an exciting example of how this can be achieved.""

Ted Stevens, Chairman of the National Self Build Association (NaSBA) said:

> ""This fund is very welcome. It should help small builders and developers who are active in the custom build sector to get projects away that have been 'mothballed' because of the difficulties they often face getting finance from the banks. And it should also be great news for groups of people who want to tackle a self build project collectively. They should be able to use the fund to buy a larger site and split it up into much more cost effective individual plots. We know that one in four would-be self builders are attracted to the idea of building together so it should be of real help to them.
>
> ""The announcement that more public land is to be set aside for self builders is fantastic news - finding a plot is the biggest challenge for most would-be self builders. I'm confident this will be warmly welcomed by the huge numbers of people keen to build a custom build home.""

The industry's self build champion, Kevin McCloud, said:

> ""Across the UK there are scores of communities keen to work alongside each other to build their homes collectively. By pooling their talents on group self build projects, they can construct great custom-designed homes at a fraction of the normal cost.
>
> ""Until now, it has been difficult for groups of people to secure funding from conventional lenders to buy larger chunks of land to split up into individual plots. Similarly, it's difficult for collectives to obtain finance to cover the initial infrastructure costs on group self build sites.
>
> ""This fund will be widely welcomed, and should lead to many pioneering group self build projects taking off. It should also be applauded by small builders and specialist self build 'enablers' as they too can apply for finance to help kickstart multi-plot self build projects.""

Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the HCA, said:

> ""We welcome this development finance, which will help provide a much-needed boost to the self-build sector. As enabler, we're also pleased to be able to put forward several of our own sites, which we hope will help groups of potential self-builders access a supply of land. These measures aim tackle the key barriers to getting self-build housing schemes off the ground.""

Barry Wood, Leader of Cherwell District Council said:

> ""Cherwell District Council has established Build!, our development programme to create 250 self-build housing opportunities for local people over the next three years. As time goes on we aim to further develop opportunities so that self-build is a mainstream housing opportunity for our residents. We believe self-build housing can achieve great outcomes for local people and the local economy. As a Council we are fully embracing this agenda and looking to secure ownership of land, including strategic sites to create serviced plots for groups and individuals to maximise opportunities for our residents.
>
> ""We are really pleased that the Government is launching its Investment Fund for community groups, builders and other organisations looking to bring forward self-build housing projects. In Cherwell we will be encouraging people to bid as we recognise this as a great opportunity for our District.""

2. The £30 million fund will be available over the next three years (2012 to 2015). The funding is intended to cover the cost of building, land acquisition or other costs associated with a proposed development of five or more custom build homes with planning permission. The funding is available to eligible applicants bringing forward projects in England with the exception of London.

3. Separate arrangements for London will be announced shortly by the Greater London Authority. Further details on London can be obtained from the Greater London Authority by emailing [CBH@London.gov.uk](mailto:CBH@London.gov.uk).

4. Datamonitor predicts a 141 per cent growth in gross advances for self build mortgages over the next three years, from £790 million to over £1.9 billion.

5. The self build industry has already taken major steps to support aspiring builders in this country with:

  * a one-stop online resource for budding self builders with all the information they need in a single place

  * better access to finance - leading to a predicted 141 per cent rise in mortgage availability for people looking to build their own homes

  * increasing interest from builders, developers, landowners and local authorities to support self home building across the country

  * the Building Societies Association publishing a 'toolkit' for lenders looking to offer self build mortgage products.

7. Custom build (or 'self build') homes are homes built or commissioned by individuals or groups of individuals for their own use, either by building the home on their own or working with builders. Custom home building typically involves individuals commissioning the construction of a new house from a builder, contractor or package company or, in a modest number of cases, physically building a house for themselves. It also includes refurbishment projects involving the conversion or regeneration of disused buildings.

8. _Laying the Foundations: A Housing Strategy for England_ sets out the Government's plans to support social mobility and get the housing market - and in particular new house building - moving again, including a Custom Build Homes programme to support and encourage more individuals and communities to build their own homes.

Mr Stunell announced the winners sharing £25.1million of government funding on a visit to one of the successful projects in Newark, Nottinghamshire alongside Independent Empty Homes Adviser and TV presenter George Clarke.

Newark and Sherwood Homes Ltd successfully applied for a £50,000 grant to purchase and bring four empty properties back into use from the Empty Homes Community Fund. These will be a mix of 2-3 bedroom houses and bungalows that will provide affordable housing for 20 people. Mr Stunell also visited Newark and Sherwood Federation of Tenants and Residents Associations to find out first hand how they have been involved in these projects.

In addition to the scheme in Newark, other successful projects include:

  * A scheme led by Southwark Habitat for Humanity to bring homes back into use across London;
  * Seven schemes from YMCAs to return properties to use; and
  * Renovated properties to provide accommodation for women at risk of domestic violence.

In many areas the expertise for returning empty homes to use lies with community groups or voluntary organisations, and that is why the Government is supporting innovative schemes around the country that will allow groups to make a real difference where in the past they have often struggled to be involved or raise finance. £25.1million has been allocated so far out of a total of £30million, with a further 20 organisations bidding for the remainder of the cash.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""It's great to see for myself the work being carried out to transform empty properties into safe family homes.
>
> ""Empty properties are a national disgrace - they attract crime and are a shocking waste of housing when millions of families need a home.
>
> ""I'm determined to tackle this problem, and that's why the Coalition is helping local groups breathe new life into their communities.""

Independent Empty Homes Advisor George Clarke said:

> ""It is so refreshing to meet people like those in Newark who are dedicated to bringing empty homes back into use. We need to find more creative and innovative ways to refurbish and remodel the many thousands of perfectly sound properties currently standing empty all over the UK. Newark is making positive strides in the right direction. However, the problem of empty homes and the demolition of perfectly good homes is a national problem and it is my job to ensure that more and more people recognise the value of refurbishment and that money is spent in the right way to stop these homes going to waste.""

Ministers in the Department for Communities and Local Government said that they would look sympathetically on councils where they have costs as a result of the floods, and announced that they would reimburse councils for 100 per cent of their clearing-up expenditure under the Bellwin scheme. Councils have a vital role, along with the emergency services, in responding to such events.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""I know that many households and businesses have been disrupted by the floods that have affected parts of the country. That is why we have announced that we will reimburse councils 100 per cent of their costs under the Bellwin scheme which will help councils clear-up streets removing debris from roads and footpaths, shore up buildings and remove dangerous trees.
>
> ""I am writing to all councils affected to see what practical support they need and the Government is continuing to monitor the situation carefully.""

The activation of the Bellwin scheme was announced in a Written Ministerial Statement to Parliament by the Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, recording that:

> ""The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is activating the Bellwin Scheme of Emergency Financial Assistance to help local authorities with their immediate costs associated with protecting life and property in their areas. Exceptionally, the scheme will reimburse local authorities for 100 per cent of their eligible costs above threshold. This is in recognition of the particular circumstances around these floods and will give the affected local authorities assurance that such costs will be reimbursed. Government officials will also be discussing the recovery arrangements with local authorities in the areas affected.""

Councils, police, fire and National park authorities are eligible for Bellwin reimbursement when they have spent more than 0.2 per cent of their calculated annual revenue budget on works that have been reported to the Department as eligible for grant.

The Government has decided that on this occasion it will reimburse 100 per cent of the costs above the threshold, instead of the standard 85 per cent as stated in the Bellwin scheme guidance.

The new Framework recognises the proficiency and experience of fire and rescue authorities and gives them the freedom and flexibility to deliver services to their communities without prescription from Whitehall. It will move accountability away from central government and place power in the hands of local communities.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""This Framework delivers on the Government commitment to clearly define national resilience and to set out clear roles and responsibilities. I welcome the opportunity to take a collaborative approach to national resilience that is based on, and drawn from, local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.""

Key priorities for fire and rescue authorities in the new framework include:

  * identifying and assessing the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their area faces
  * making provision for prevention and protection activities and responding to incidents appropriately
  * working in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and
  * being accountable to communities for the service they provide.

The Framework enables fire and rescue authorities to efficiently deliver their services against a backdrop of change and the need to cut the national deficit.

In addition the Framework clearly defines national resilience setting out clear roles and responsibilities as well as setting out arrangements for fire and rescue authorities to collectively engage with government on national resilience issues through a new Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board. The Board will enable a collaborative approach to national resilience that is based on and drawn from local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has praised the innovation and 'can-do' attitude of Hereford Enterprise Zone for teaming up with global aerospace companies to create local jobs and stimulate growth.

![Hereford Enterprise Zone](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2179557.jpg)Hereford Enterprise Zone

Hereford Enterprise Zone has been promoting the strengths of the local area as a hotspot for high tech businesses investment, which includes immediate tax breaks for companies.

After seeing the huge benefits available, two global Aerospace companies, Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing based in Georgia and MARKET-MATS from the Ukraine, recently announced ambitious plans to locate in the area.

The move signals a major step forward in development of the Hereford Enterprise Zone with the potential to create hundreds of new jobs, bring wider benefits to the local area and mark out Herefordshire and Britain as a great choice for businesses across the globe.

Yesterday the Communities Secretary met with the Governor of Washington State, Christine Gregoire, representatives from Herefordshire Council and the Aerospace companies to welcome the planned investment into the Hereford Enterprise Zone and wider Herefordshire area.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""This agreement shows that our low tax, light-touch regulation Enterprise Zones and Herefordshire's 'can do' ambitions are a great combination that business are eager to take advantage of - Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing and Market-Mats will bring new jobs to the area and energise the local economy.""

A new generation of 24 Enterprise Zones with simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses, now span across England. The Zones are helping to create conditions to stimulate growth and have the potential to create tens of thousands of new jobs by 2015.

With just two weeks to go before the start of the Olympics, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has called on social housing landlords in East London to be extra vigilant and take tough action against tenancy cheats trying to make a fast-buck out of sub-letting their homes.

His call came ahead of the Second Reading of a Government-backed Private Members Bill - introduced by Richard Harrington MP - aimed at tackling the multi-billion pound tenancy fraud scam. Measures include making the sub-letting of social homes a criminal offence for the first time, and forcing profits made from unlawful sub-letting to be paid back to the landlord. A summary of responses to the consultation and the proposed next steps are also published today.

In the meantime, the Minister is calling on all social housing landlords to use their existing powers to their full extent including eviction.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Sub-letting a much needed social home is not a clever piece of private enterprise in action. Instead it's a multi-billion pound scam that denies families in need a decent home. That's why I'm giving my full backing to this Bill.
>
> ""Anyone in London hoping to profiteer by sub-letting their council house in the coming weeks needs to know that they could lose their tenancies by unlawfully renting out their home.
>
> ""And if these fraudsters think this wheeze is a gateway to earning thousands in the future, then they also need to know that it may soon become a criminal offence.
>
> ""The Olympics are a great opportunity for London to welcome the world. They are not an excuse for wide boys to rip off the taxpayer. We won't allow cheating outside the Olympic Park anymore than it will be allowed within it.""

Conservative MP Richard Harrington said:

> ""I join Grant's call for landlords to be extra vigilant over this Olympics summer. By introducing my Private Members Bill I want to see stronger punishments for those who commit tenancy fraud and introduce effective deterrents. This new legislation will go a long way in tackling this problem in the long term""

Estimates suggest that between 50,000 and 160,000 social homes are unlawfully occupied across the country. Even at the lowest estimate to replace the social homes that are being unlawfully occupied - to house those who have effectively been displaced by tenancy fraudsters - would cost several billion pounds.

Mr Shapps said social housing landlords and councils could learn from others taking on tenancy cheats including:

  * **Hounslow** - used Government funding to enable Homes for Hounslow to hire a tenancy fraud officer and as a result recovered 41 properties between July 2010 and June 2011. Properties recovered included: Clayponds Garden, Ealing - sublet for more than 20 years; and Snowy Fielder Way - the tenant had relocated to USA and the property had been sublet for more than 10 years.
  * **Wolverhampton Homes** - used Government funding to employ a dedicated fraud officer, produce publicity material to raise awareness and recruit two tenancy officers to work on high rise blocks conducting tenancy audits and assisting with fraud reports. One recent case involved a tenant who the council believed had not lived at the property for over 20 years, only returning once a week for about 40 minutes. The tenant refused to terminate the tenancy but at the final court hearing the judge ruled in the council's favour and awarded outright possession plus costs.
  * **Enfield** - hired two specialist officers to tackle tenancy fraud with Government funding, resulting in the recovery of around 90 properties to date.

In summary it will, subject to Parliamentary approval, create new criminal offences of unauthorised sub-letting with the prospect of imprisonment on conviction; give local authorities the power to prosecute these new offences both for other local authorities and on behalf of housing associations as well as on their own behalf; provide for unlawful profit orders in both criminal and civil proceedings, which will require the person against whom the order is made to pay to the landlord any profit made from unlawful sub-letting; and, ensure that an assured tenant of a housing association permanently loses their assured status when they sub-let or part with possession of the whole of their property.",13-Jul-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Government's new business rate retention scheme enables councils to retain a proportion of locally collected business rates which they can use to help fund services to their communities. A consultation was launched today setting out proposals of how the retention scheme could work.

A plain English guide explaining business rate retention was also published so people can easily see how the scheme will work and what benefits it can bring.

The local growth scheme is part of the Local Government Finance Bill currently before Parliament and has huge potential to boost local growth and councils' coffers and could add an additional £10 billion to the national Gross Domestic Product over the next seven years.

The Bill seeks to create a new incentive for local government across England to support growth by directly linking a council's financial revenue to the decisions they take to back local firms and local jobs. Councils will be able to keep 50 per cent of their business rates, providing a strong incentive to go for growth.

The Bill also puts councils in charge of providing council tax support so it can be administered in a way that best meets local needs and supports local people. These changes go hand in hand with the wider economic reforms and will ensure the new system is a fairer one, where taxpayers can be more confident that work pays and the benefits bill is controlled.

Draft regulations were also published to help Local Authorities set up localised council tax support schemes, which must be in place by the end of January 2013. This gives councils the time and opportunity to design and implement those new local schemes in time.

Bob Neill said:

> ""We're determined to give councils more financial control and the Local Government Finance Bill gives them a new incentive system that ensures they have the best opportunity to boost local growth, which could potentially add £10 billion to the wider economy.
>
> ""Spending on council tax benefit has more than doubled since 1997. The Bill will also put council tax support in local hands so it can better meet local needs. Councils now have all the information they need to start putting in place their own local schemes well ahead of the new year deadline.""

The business rate retention scheme consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/businessratestechnical](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/businessratestechnical)  and will close on 24 September.

The Government has already published key details of the rate retention framework: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2146467](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2146764).

The new system will be fair and equitable for all areas with protections for vulnerable or less prosperous areas. Business rate growth would be shared evenly between central and local government. The 'local share' would be retained in full by councils and would be set at 50 per cent for the seven year period. The full 'central share' will always be returned in grants to local government.

In addition councils would get to keep 100 per cent business rates from new renewable energy projects. These would not count against the local-central shares.

A centrally run safety net fund would provide support should a council's income drop below a set baseline, protecting areas which suffer a downturn.

Major landlords are to follow ministers' requests to open their books to taxpayers and tenants and let them see how they spend their rent money, Grant Shapps said today.

Mr Shapps welcomed the news that Adactus, Hyde and Sanctuary housing associations - who between them manage over 100,000 homes - are to follow in the footsteps of Whitehall and Town Halls and publish details of their spending for all to see.

These latest housing associations join the likes of Home Group, Viridian and Hereford Housing in embracing transparency by throwing open their books. But Mr Shapps warned that too many landlords were ""still way behind the curve"" and needed to follow the example set today.

### Nation of armchair auditors

From the start Grant Shapps has been clear that housing associations should do as councils do - and the Department for Communities and Local Government itself does - and publish details of their spending. Home Group were first to answer the call in 2011, and now routinely publish detail of all spending above £500 - with Viridian and Hereford Housing Associations doing the same from earlier this year.

Mr Shapps said he was ""delighted"" that Adactus, Hyde and Sanctuary will now also make their spending information public for the first time. But he argued that with the range of measures taken since May 2010 to open Whitehall's accounts to scrutiny, more landlords should take this action.

Since November 2010, the Department for Communities and Local Government has listed all spending over £500.

The moves have been part of wider efforts to create what ministers have called a ""nation of armchair auditors"" - able to see first hand how their taxes are spent.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""I am delighted that Adactus, Hyde and Sanctuary will be throwing open their books to scrutiny for the first time - this is a real step forward that will increase tenants' confidence in the value for money they receive, and help these landlords become even more efficient in what they do. I would like to congratulate them in making this huge step forward, following in the path of Whitehall and Town Halls in making their work more transparent.
>
> ""This increases the number of housing associations routinely publishing this information but still means the majority of social landlords are way behind the curve. In contrast, councils across the country are already making this data available, so residents can see how money is spent and crack down on waste, from excessive salaries to cab fares.
>
> ""So I want to see more housing associations follow what Adactus, Hyde and Sanctuary have today said they'll do and put the power of the paper trail firmly in the hands of their residents. This is now an inevitable trend that all social landlords must join.""

The 500-year old school will be the base for around 100 athletes and officials from the athletics squad, who will stay in two boarding houses and use the running track and sports facilities.

Marking Host a Nation Week, Mr Clark said it was an honour for Kent to host the Australian team, and their presence would help inspire a great Olympic legacy for the local area.

Australia's athletes, who took part in a Q and A and training session with local school children, will train, eat and sleep in the school before moving to the Olympic village shortly before their events start.

Stars staying at Tonbridge School will include Australian team captain Steve Hooker, who will be defending his Olympic pole vault title in London, as well as world discus champion Dani Samuels and Olympic hurdles silver medallist Sally Pearson.

Communities Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""It's a great honour that the Australian team have chosen to base their athletics team at Tonbridge School. The school has a rich sporting heritage, and now a new generation of pupils and local residents will be inspired by elite athletes training and preparing for the Games. I know the team will enjoy their stay here, and I wish them the very best for the weeks ahead.""

Earlier in the day Greg Clark attended a Torch Relay event in Tunbridge Wells, and handed out local Sports England awards in Maidstone as more than £4.7 million of new funding was announced for the Places People Play legacy programme in the South East.

Mr Clark added:

> ""It's great that so many local projects are going to benefit from this funding - there are three in this area alone. There is another £10 million available which is going to provide a great Olympic legacy for local sports clubs so I would encourage everyone to apply.""

Cllr Maria Heslop, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council's Cabinet Member for Leisure, Youth and Arts, said:

> ""The arrival of the Australian team is a fantastic opportunity to put Tonbridge and Malling on the international map. We are also delighted to welcome one of the UK's most famous Olympians Dame Kelly Holmes, who will be holding the Olympic Torch in Tonbridge today, shining a light on all of the opportunities the borough has to offer.""

Australian Olympic Team Manager Susan Hobson, said:

> ""The facilities and staff at Tonbridge School are world-class and you can't ask for anything more than that when preparing for the greatest sporting event on the planet. We have been welcomed with open arms, accommodated across the board and even the weather has been marginally better than elsewhere in the country, so we couldn't be happier.""

Tim Haynes, Headmaster of Tonbridge School, said:

> ""We are delighted to welcome the Australian Olympic athletes to Tonbridge. We are very proud of our fine sporting facilities at the school and we hope that they provide the very best setting for their final schedule of training.""

Host a Nation week, which runs from now until the 22 July 2012, encourages local communities who are hosting Pre-Games Training Camps to capitalise on the longer-term opportunities created by the Olympics.

The programme encourages communities to build on links and to create cultural, sporting or business links with visitors from abroad. These could include music, film or food festivals, school events, or using UKTI's British Business Club to promote local areas and create strong trading links with new partners.

291,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2183601,Report highlights chaos of troubled families' lives,helping-troubled-families-turn-their-lives-around,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"Louise Casey CB has published a [report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/listeningtroubledfamilies) highlighting the chaotic personal histories of the kinds of families who will be targeted as part of the Government's commitment to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families by 2015.

The report details stark real-life accounts from families, with experiences often passed from generation to generation, such as domestic and sexual abuse, teenage pregnancies, poor parenting, social care interventions, police call outs and educational failure. It also contains Louise Casey's early conclusions that a whole-family approach is often best for dealing with multiple and inter-linked problems; rather than approaches that deal with single problems or single individuals within a household.

Key recurring themes highlighted in the report include:

  * Dysfunctional and unstable family structures;
  * History repeating itself within families and between generations;
  * Extended family and antisocial networks within communities which reinforce destructive behaviour; and
  * The need for one assertive family worker who offers practical help and support but also sanction in dealing with families.

Head of Troubled Families Policy Louise Casey said:

> ""I am not making excuses for any family failing to send their kids to school or causing trouble in their community. However unless we really understand what it is about these families that means they behave in this way, we can't start to turn their lives around.
>
> ""Conducting these interviews has been an eye-opening experience - to hear first hand about the lives these families lead and the legacy of trouble that's often been passed down to them. It's clearer than ever to me now that we cannot go on allowing families to fail their children; none of the parents I spoke to wanted their children to repeat a life of chaos and trouble, but often they couldn't see how to put things right by themselves - they needed practical and persistent help to do so.""

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I welcome this report as it provides a real insight into these families' dysfunctional lives and highlights the urgent need to turn them around. The Troubled Families team in my department are not just sitting in an office in Whitehall telling local authorities what to do but seeking to gain a true understanding of the challenges they face.""

Under the Troubled Families programme the Department for Communities and Local Government will pay upper-tier local authorities up to £4,000 per eligible family on a payment-by-results basis if they reduce truancy, youth crime and anti-social behaviour or put parents back into work.

The Government's £448m three-year budget is drawn from across seven departments in a bid to join up local services dealing with these families on the frontline. All 152 upper-tier authorities in England have committed to engaging in the programme.

Speaking in Liverpool, Mr Stunell echoed calls from the Professional Footballers Association that clubs should look to tear up the contracts of players who have engaged in racist behaviour on or off the pitch.

He also recommended that teams look to invest in diversity training for players, especially those coming to the UK for the first time from overseas, to help educate them on race issues and on the behaviour expected from professional sportsmen in 21st century Britain.

Appearing on a panel alongside other MPs from the North West, Mr Stunell answered questions from a live audience on a wide range of race-related issues including a number related to the current spate of controversies surrounding high profile Premier League players.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""We saw last season that the ugly face of racism reappeared in the beautiful game. I want to see it kicked out once and for all and to show there are severe consequences for those players who continue to behave in such an unacceptable manner.

""Our clubs have a clear duty-of-care to their players, particularly when bringing them over to a new and unfamiliar country. They need to produce well-rounded human beings as well as well-rounded footballers.
>
> ""Whether they like it or not, these global superstars are role models to millions of young people. Teams need to invest in prevention to root out this problem before it takes hold and have tough sanctions in place if it all goes wrong.""

Earlier this year, the Prime Minister hosted a meeting at Number 10 that looked at how the Government could support the football authorities and campaign groups to send a clear message that any form of discrimination will not be tolerated in the national game. £3million of funding was also announced to help coaches from BME backgrounds progress further in the game.",20-Jul-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today will also see the hallowed rings raised across Whitehall as all Government departments mark the start of the build-up to the Games. The flag will be flown alongside the Union Flag until 20 August when it will then be replaced by the Agitos - the flag of the Paralympics.

The Olympic flag was created by Pierre De Coubertin in 1914. Its five rings symbolise the five inhabited continents of the world, united by the Olympics, and the six colours were those used on all national flags when it was designed.

Mr Neill was joined by competition winner and member of DCLG staff, Robert Segall, who also leads on planning policy issues surrounding flag flying. The Department is currently assessing responses to a discussion paper on relaxing the planning regime on flag flying and allowing people to fly more flags without having to seek and pay for planning consent from their local authority.

Bob Neill said:

> ""It is an honour to raise the Olympic flag over DCLG today. All Government Departments are doing this today and I am very pleased to show our support and demonstrate DCLG's commitment to making these Games a success.""

Robert Segall said:

> ""I feel privileged to play this small part in the Olympic programme. It is a special feeling to have a hands-on role in your own policy area.""

282,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2185517,Pop-up shops and entrepreneurs to prosper from high street changes,improving-high-streets-and-town-centres,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"New proposals to re-activate empty shops and reclaim underused street space

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today highlighted government proposals to scrap restrictions that put off start-up businesses from temporarily using empty high street shops that can help attract shoppers back to more family friendly town centres.

Temporary or 'pop-up' shops often utilise vacant high street premises until a permanent tenant can be found. One of the barriers to start-up firms can be planning rules that control what type of business a shop can and can't be used for.

The proposals would scale back the red tape that causes shop owners costly delays securing planning permission, over £1200 on average, before a disused shop can be used for a different purpose. Landlords would instead be free to temporarily change the use of an empty shop for two years, something currently not automatically permitted.

Experts say high street footfall has dropped two per cent on last year while the national high street vacancy rate remains at eleven per cent. Mr Pickles thinks empty properties are a wasted economic opportunity spoiling towns and attracting anti-social behavior.

Minsters believe this deregulation can help reinvigorate the high street by opening up more affordable places for entrepreneurs to launch start-up businesses, which in turn will re-energise local economies, end the blight of boarded up shops and help landlords meet property costs. Standard temporary leases are also available making it simpler to agree.

For example two young entrepreneurs in Willesden Green were able to turn a 15 year vacant building into a pop-up boutique, called Roses and Strings, selling handcrafted gifts and accessories after agreeing a special £250 a month deal with the landlord.

The Government has committed over £80 million to provide start-up loans for young entrepreneurs, which could create over 30,000 new businesses. The steps being highlighted today will make it easier for start-ups to find low-cost stores to set up in.

A new guide also published today shows how use of high street areas can help attract customers. _Re-imagining urban spaces to help revitalise our high streets_ identifies ways to lure shoppers into town by making it a more social experience, as recommended by Mary Portas. Ideas include removing street clutter for pedestrians, more street stalls and pop-up shops as well as attractions like pavement cafes, play areas, outdoor libraries or street entertainment.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Shopping habits are changing and the high street must respond. The trip to town needs to be worthwhile. In just the same way as the cinema offers a better movie going experience than TV the high street needs to come up with ways to give it an edge over internet deals and out of town shopping centres.
>
> ""Leaving empty shops to rot is a wasted economic opportunity that spoils the town centre - that is why we are proposing to scrap the damaging red tape that is keeping so many boarded up. This change can unleash our young entrepreneurs to open pop-up shops and turn the high streets into an exciting start-up launch pad.
>
> ""Reclaiming dreary unused street space can breathe new life into high streets - by decluttering streets for pedestrians, creating a lively atmosphere with pavement cafes, pop-up shop spots and entertainment so they are more family friendly fun place to go.""

### Notes to editors

1. As part of its Plan for Growth the Government announced a review of how change of use is handled in the planning system in order to look at reducing the planning burden and support economic growth.

Planning permission is usually required for anything that is considered to be a 'material' change of use. In general, planning permission is required for 'development'. Change of use can be considered as 'development' and therefore under the current legislation change of use can require planning permission.

The cost of a planning application can vary for the applicant. The Arup report finds that the average cost of a change of use planning application is around £1,245 and could vary between £290 and £3,370. The average mean of £1,250 has been taken as the best estimate. This includes administrative costs such as preparing the application and the fees paid.

Secondary legislation (the Use Classes Order introduced in 1972) defines broad classes of use for buildings or other land and provides that a change of use is not 'development' where the former use and the new use are both within the same use class. It is almost 10 years since the last substantial review of the approach to change of use.

There are four main categories:

  * **Class A** covers shops and other retail premises such as restaurants and bank branches
  * **Class B** covers offices, workshops, factories and warehouses
  * **Class C** covers residential uses
  * **Class D** covers non-residential institutions and assembly and leisure uses

The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order gives a general planning permission for specified changes of use between classes by classifying them as permitted development.

To open up premises to new businesses and allow redundant buildings to be brought back into use Government consulting on a proposal to allow temporary uses of certain existing high street buildings. This would be for certain specified new uses for a period of 2 years.

Removing these restrictions on a temporary basis for empty buildings would open up premises, which otherwise would make no contribution to the local economy. This will boost high street and local area regeneration helping encourage start up businesses.

The Government consultation is proposing action in the following key areas:

  * To create permitted development rights to assist change of use from existing buildings used for agricultural purposes to uses supporting rural growth;
  * To increase the thresholds for permitted development rights for change of use between B1 (business/office) and B8 (warehouse) classes and from B2 (industry) to B1 and B8;
  * To introduce a permitted development right to allow the temporary use of certain for two years, where the use would be low impact, without the need for planning permission.
  * To provide C1 (hotels, boarding and guest houses) permitted development rights to convert to C3 (dwelling houses) without the need for planning permission; and
  * To consider if any updates or amendments are needed to the existing descriptions within the use classes order.

More details can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation).

2. Last year the Government invited Mary Portas to carry out an independent review into the high street. It made ambitious recommendations for how - Government, councils and business - can put the heart back into high streets, re-imagined as exciting social hubs for shopping learning, socialising and having fun. The Government's response has included:

  * Twelve town centres selected as the first 'Portas Pilots' tasked with coming up with new ideas to breathe life into underused high streets. Each will receive a slice of £1.2 million and a tailored package of support. A further round of pilots is expected to be announced later this month.
  * A multi-million pound High Street Innovation Fund - kick started by £10 million will help bring empty shops back into use - which, if supplemented by councils and landlords, could see £30 million going to support new business start-ups and re-activate many empty properties. A list of the authorities to be paid can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/regeneration/pdf/2120116.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/regeneration/pdf/2120116.pdf)
  * A National Markets Day and Love Your Local Fortnight helped over a thousand aspiring entrepreneurs try out their business ideas at over 300 markets.
  * A £500,000 fund for Business Improvement Districts, to with loans for set-up costs.
  * Small Business Rate Relief in England has been doubled for two and a half years, from 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2013. To make sure no small firm loses out the Localism Act has simplified the process for claiming the tax break to encourage take up by small businesses. More information is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972672](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972672).

3. High Street footfall was 2.0 per cent lower than a year ago in the three months to April, while the national town centre vacancy rate in the UK remained at 11 per cent according to the British Retail Consortium. [www.brc.org.uk/brc_news_detail.asp?id=2211&kCat=681&kData=2](http://www.brc.org.uk/brc_news_detail.asp?id=2211&kCat=681&kData=2) (external link).

4. Barclay's data estimates that in 2009, there were 37,100 start-ups by the under 25s, representing nine per cent of the total start-ups in that year in England and Wales. The 2010 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor evidence indicates that 4.9 per cent of 18-24 year olds intended to start-up in the next 3 years or around 100,000 young people. The Household Entrepreneurship Survey (2007) shows that a relatively high proportion (17 per cent) of 18-24 year olds thought about starting a business, buying into an existing business or becoming self-employed, compared to 11 per cent for all age groups. However just 6 per cent of 18-24s were self-employment and owning a business, compared to 14 per cent for the population as a whole. Around 4 per cent (250,000) of 16-24 year-olds had considered starting a business but had not due to financial reasons.

5. Standard 'meanwhile use' leases can be found here: [www.meanwhile.org.uk/useful-info/view/legal](http://www.meanwhile.org.uk/useful-info/view/legal) (external link).

Meanwhile Space works with landlords, landowners, developers and
local authorities to advise and deliver projects to identify temporary
uses for redundant shops, offices, cleared land etc. whilst an appropriate commercial solution is being sought. Eddie Bridgeman, Director, Meanwhile Space CIC said:

> ""Meanwhile Space has been championing this proposed change to planning rules, which will enable start-up businesses to rapidly access redundant high street buildings and bring them back into use. By helping to unlock some of the challenges to the meanwhile use of empty spaces, this will help to reduce the risk for people testing new enterprising or social ideas. Alongside the wider the ambitions of the Portas Review, removing planning red tape can help to breed the diverse activity that is vital to the future success of our high streets.""

6. _Re-imagining urban spaces to help revitalise our high streets_ has been written and produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government as part of its Portas programme of support for high streets. It describes the many different ways to imaginatively to revitalise high streets and town centres - increasing high street vitality, attracting footfall and boosting local economies. Town centres and high streets have buildings and roads, but the spaces in-between are what hold them together as a place - the squares, urban green spaces and the network of streets, pavements and pedestrian thoroughfares that knit them together. All too often, these spaces are used as no more than thoroughfares but they can be so much more. The guide is full of successful case studies, and resources that can help local groups re-imagine the urban spaces in their area to help revitalise their local high streets and town centres. The guide was developed in partnership with 19 expert organisations, including the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, Arts Council England, English Heritage, Design Council, Living Streets, the Association of Town Centre Management, the British Council of Shopping Centres, the Urban Design Group and the Landscape Institute. It can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/urbanspaces](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/urbanspaces).

7. Edward Cooke, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at British Council of Shopping Centres said:

> ""Creating vibrant public spaces and encouraging community involvement in town and city centres bolsters places both socially and economically. As retail destinations continue to compete with online and multi-channel retailing, we should remember that the most successful locations benefit from the creation of 'theatre' and a sense of place. At this time of enormous change for the retail property industry, we must all work together, taking shared responsibility for the future prosperity of our town centres. The paper the Minister is launching today, showcasing examples of positive and proactive use of shared space, is a valuable contribution to this agenda.""

Tony Armstrong, Chief Executive of Living Streets said:

> ""Living Streets welcomes _Re-imagining urban spaces to help revitalise our high streets_ as a useful toolkit which will help local authorities create and maintain safe, attractive town centre and high streets where people want to walk. The principles of naked streets or shared space offers numerous benefits for high streets and town centres including increased footfall and economic benefits provided they are done well and carried out in consultation with local communities. In particular we are pleased to see Living Streets' Community Street Audit acknowledged in the document as a useful tool to engage local communities in order to tackle the barriers to walk and to identify opportunities to improve high streets and town centres for local people, businesses and shoppers across the country.""

Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of Town and Country Planning Association added:

> ""This publication is a welcome call to action to re-imagine our high streets and town centres. In thinking about the future of our public spaces we need to ensure they are attractive, vibrant and accessible to everyone, regardless of age, gender, disability or ethnicity.""",20-Jul-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
273,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2186968,Tenants equipped with the facts on Right to Buy,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,grant-shapps,,"A fresh drive to help a new generation of social tenants understand how they could buy their home with dramatically increased discounts was today launched by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

A new dedicated call centre and user-friendly website have now gone live to ensure aspiring home-owners among England's 2.5 million social tenants can get advice and information about changes to the Right to Buy.

Launched in April, the reinvigorated scheme offers eligible tenants discounts of up to £75,000 off the value of their home, with a national pledge that every additional property sold will be replaced with a new affordable home to rent.

While figures provided by a number of councils across England point to a surge in interest and Right to Buy applications since the new discounts came into force, research commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government suggests that many council and housing association tenants are unaware of the changes - or unsure whether they are eligible to apply.

The new call centre and website are part of a wider campaign to make sure tenants have all the information they need to decide whether Right to Buy is the right option for them.

### Right to Buy for 2.5million tenants

From today, those looking to buy their council home will be able to ring a dedicated call centre on 0300 123 0913 - or visit a new website at [www.communities.gov.uk/righttobuy](http://righttobuy.communities.gov.uk/) for help and advice on the discount they could be eligible for, and the next steps they need to take.

Councils across the country have reported a surge in interest from tenants since the discounts available under the Right to Buy scheme have been increased.

These include:

  * Wandsworth Council in South London, who between April and June this year received 141 applications, compared to just 13 during the same period in 2011; and
  * Birmingham City Council, who received 463 applications in the three months to June 2012, compared to 219 during the same period in 2011

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years, the Right to Buy for council tenants was undermined by punitive cuts to the discounts available, locking the door to home ownership for millions of hard-working people.
>
> ""Now, our revitalised Right to Buy scheme has trebled the discount in many areas, and has led to a surge in interest from aspiring homeowners across the country. But our research clearly shows that too many tenants are still in the dark about what this could mean for them.
>
> ""That's why today I'm launching a dedicated call centre and website for anyone wanting to use their Right to Buy so that those wanting to buy their council home are equipped with all the facts, make an informed decision and take full advantage of the revitalised scheme to feel the pride of home ownership.""

The Right to Buy gives something back to families who have worked hard and paid their rent, giving them more freedom to change their home to suit them and a sense of pride and ownership - not just in their home, but in their street and wider neighbourhood. Since its launch in 1980, nearly two million social homes have been bought under Right to Buy, building mixed communities and improving social mobility for families across the country.

### Notes to editors

Research commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government suggests that many tenants are still not fully aware of the opportunity that Right to Buy offers them to get onto the housing ladder. In a survey of 824 social housing tenants in May 2012 conducted by Ipsos MORI, 83 per cent of respondents were either not aware of the Right to Buy, or were not aware of the changes.

I'm pleased to see it was in the capable hands of London fire-fighters and experienced the welcome from this vibrant Yacht Club in Erith. This is a wonderful club that offers affordable sailing for local people and the many children we saw enjoying the river and accompanying the Torch. I'm proud that regeneration money has helped to provide a much needed new clubhouse and workshops - all for the benefit of local people.""

Bob Neil greeted the torch at Erith with Teresa O'Neill, Leader of the Council and Will Tuckley, Chief Executive, Bexley Council, as well as hundreds of young sailors and members of the Yacht Club.

Erith Yacht club works to provide affordable and accessible sailing opportunities for local people, particularly young people and people with disabilities. DCLG has helped fund and support the Yacht Club, which was awarded £2.35 million from DCLG's Homes and Community Agency's Sustainable Communities Fund, designed to create a lasting sporting legacy from the Olympic Games. They now have a brand new, multi functional clubhouse designed by local people for local people, and new accessible boats.

This morning Bob Neill was on the Torch route in Bromley where he breakfasted at St Mark's Bromley with members of the church and the wider community. He shared food with Doug Patterson, Chief Executive of Bromley Council, community leaders and Torch bearers.

He said:

> ""It's been lovely to be here in Bromley supporting the Torch and the Torch bearers as they run past St Mark's. The community is here at the church celebrating the splendid occasion of the Torch Relay whilst enjoying breakfast with our friends and colleagues. The Reverend  Steve Varney, Vicar of St Mark's has welcomed us all into his church to join with the community including Doug Patterson, Chief Executive of the Council to support the Torch as it shines a light on Bromley and this wonderful Borough.""

The Reverend Varney said:

> ""It was wonderful that the community joined in a breakfast feast in celebration of the Torch in Bromley. Families and friends coming together is at the heart of the Olympic spirit and we really demonstrated this today.""

Expressing gratitude for the positive way the majority of councils have worked with the sector over the last year, Mr Stunell urged councils not to let this hard work go to waste and continue to utilise the voluntary and community sector's abilities to provide high quality, good value services.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""I believe that the best councils can and will continue to support their voluntary and community sector, as we get the country's economy on the road to recovery.
>
> ""Many local authorities are already setting a good example showing what can be achieved under demanding circumstances, and the government has now published further guidance to help councils working with voluntary groups.
>
> ""Whilst councils have more tough decisions to make in the coming months, that is no excuse for abandoning the voluntary and community sector.""

Last year the Government published new [Best Value Guidance](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/bestvaluestatguidance) which set out the manner in which councils should work with the voluntary sector.

Local councils have now been freed from excessive and prescriptive guidance and duties in return for a 'social responsibility' deal which asks that they continue to give support to local voluntary and community groups and small businesses.

Compact Voice and the Department for Communities and Local Government have now also jointly produced a briefing note which provides practical views on how the guidance can be best used to ensure effective partnerships.

Some of the best examples of local authorities working hand-in-hand with the voluntary sector over the past year include:

  * Colchester council increased their budget for the voluntary and community sector by £42,000 in 2011/12 and have protected it for 2012/13;
  * Merton council has protected voluntary and community sector budgets and grants because they are seen as a good investment; and
  * Community Action Derby used the Best Value Guidance as a way to influence proposed funding decisions made by Derby City Council. As a result, sixteen charities had their funding reinstated while further consultation was undertaken.

261,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2188414,Problem drinking tackled in 10 more communities with small grants injection,bringing-people-together-in-strong-united-communities,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"Baroness Newlove, the Government's Champion for Active, Safer Communities, today announced the names of ten areas across the country that will each be awarded small grants of up to £10,000 to test innovative ideas that will help reduce problem drinking and related antisocial behaviour, improve how communities work together and make real changes to their area.

These new grassroot projects are genuine community coalitions of local police, community activists, local authorities and retailers. Each area has identified the issues that are of greatest concern to their communities and have developed local solutions to test out ideas that can be built on to help transform their neighbourhoods.

The ten successful projects include rural communities and town centres, local parks and residential areas and involve partnerships with for example; local schools, youth centres and hospitals.

The ten areas are:

  * Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent
  * Croydon, London
  * Exeter, Devon
  * Great Yarmouth, Norfolk
  * Horsham, West Sussex
  * Lancaster, Lancashire
  * North Tyneside
  * Nottingham
  * Reading, Berkshire
  * St Helens, Merseyside

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I am convinced that the solution to underage and binge drinking and the crime and anti-social behaviour that comes in its wake can only be found when everyone, those affected and those paid to stamp it out, come together with total resolve to tackle it head-on. It's not about huge amounts of money either, some of the best most effective approaches involve pooling resources, sharing information and improving existing communications.
>
> ""These ten areas, like the original ten, have impressed me with a local plan involving community activists, police, health workers and the retail trade and I want other communities facing similar problems to learn from their innovative example.
>
> ""For too long, a small minority has impacted adversely on our happiness, health and security. We have to change society's tolerance to this unacceptable behaviour and the fight-back will be sown in these grassroots partnerships.
>
> ""Their success will be helped by the range of community powers available to them through new Government legislation and I shall be mentoring them and encouraging them throughout.""

The ten areas form part of a national network of communities working to tackle binge and underage drinking and anti social behaviour which Baroness Newlove will be supporting, including the ten areas announced in May that are sharing a £1million fund and the 'Newlove Neighbourhoods'.

This network will celebrate and support all the hard work that communities are putting in, allowing them to share ideas and best practice across the country, and together, solve common problems and identify the red tape holding them back.

Among the ten projects that will receive funding are:

  * Horsham, Sussex, the local youth services and the YMCA are developing a project for young people to design and present their own 'mocktails' - non alcoholic cocktails. The project will not only allow local young people to learn about the problems of binge drinking, but will also offer them a chance to develop employment skills.
  * Great Yarmouth are supporting a community project called The Den Life Changes project, where local people support young people and their families to turn their lives around from drug and alcohol abuse. They will also roll out a mentoring project based on the principles of work at The Den.
  * In Nottingham, a local charity is developing a binge drinking awareness project in three city centre schools. The project would be aimed at years 10/11 and include drama workshops, an art campaign, and a health education programme about alcohol, which can then be taken forward in these and neighbouring schools.
  * North Tyneside are building on a project run by the local Primary Care Trust which employs an A&E Link Worker to deal with the issue of alcohol related hospital admissions of young people. This project will establish a package of support with local services for young people including mentoring.

### Notes to editors

1. According to a 2010 Home Office Impact Assessment, alcohol-related crime is estimated to cost £8billion - £13billion a year.

2. On 14 May 2012, Baroness Newlove announced that ten areas would receive funding available to local authorities to spend over a two-year period with each receiving in the region of £45,000 per year. The ten areas who received this funding were:

  * Bury, Greater Manchester
  * Chelmsford, Essex
  * Cornwall
  * County Durham
  * Lincoln, Lincolnshire
  * Maidstone, Kent
  * Moseley, Birmingham
  * Newcastle
  * Shropshire
  * Wakefield, West Yorkshire

3. These further ten areas announced today will receive up to £10,000 to spend over one year to spend on discrete projects to test innovative ideas to tackle binge drinking and antisocial behaviour.

4. In her most recent report, Baroness Newlove set out the importance of tackling the damage associated with problem drinking and announced her intention to give up to ten areas in England the money and extra resources for projects to make their neighbourhoods safer and better places to live. The report also highlighted the good practice already out there, such as the community based projects based in East Belfast, Derry, Maidstone, and Newquay that are successfully dealing with problem drinking head on.

![Eric Pickles visiting the new manufacturing institute](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2189195.jpg)The institute is close to the legendary Dagenham factory

The new Institute has been created in partnership with the Centre for Engineering and Manufacturing Excellence and Ford Britain, who are investing a further £1.44million, and is located in a manufacturing heartland a short distance from the legendary Dagenham factory.

The Institute will develop new and innovative ways to improve manufacturing techniques and increase productivity that will ensure Britain remains a top choice for investment. It is expected to generate £80million to the local economy.

The Institute will develop state of the art virtual manufacturing systems to assist companies to develop and implement world leading manufacturing processes, which are often too costly for many organisations to design themselves.

It will bring together leading lights from the worlds of business, engineering and academia employing 22 researchers and PhD students to work alongside 6 Ford research staff to create programmes that will help develop the high skilled work force needed to operate such systems.

Mr Pickles was joined by Ford Britain Chairman Joe Greenwell, as well as Chief Executive Bill Williams and Chairman, Martin Broadhurst of the Centre for Engineering and Manufacturing Excellence. They met engineers learning the skills to drive the industry forward in the future.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""This country and county has a proud history of manufacturing. By investing in high-tech skills and innovation we can help ensure that as well as being part of our past, quality manufacturing is part of our future.
>
> ""By promoting enterprise, pushing forward research, creating jobs and giving people more skills we are sending a powerful signal that Britain is a top choice for inward investment and with that bringing local growth back to communities.
>
> ""This is an Institute with a big ambition, to push back the frontiers of manufacturing, quicken production and reduce costs and bring benefits to business as well as the local area. It is a delight to open this new Institute and to pledge £3.5million of investment.""

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""By bringing together the leading lights from business, academia and engineering the institute presents a wonderful opportunity to put Britain back at the forefront of manufacturing achievement.
>
> ""The Government is committed helping to stimulate local enterprise and help drive local growth investment in projects like this that not only boost businesses but bring about wider benefits to the local area. As the world's eyes turn to this area in the coming weeks, this institute stands out as a beacon of the innovation in the manufacturing industry.""

Joe Greenwell, Ford of Britain chairman, said:

> ""Ford is delighted to be a founding partner in this exciting new initiative. The Institute will accelerate research and development in innovative manufacturing systems that will help underpin the future of the UK's high value manufacturing sector. This complements the work that Ford is already doing in this area and also provides significant opportunities for supply chain partners.""

Bill Williams, CEO of the Centre for Engineering and Manufacturing Excellence said:

> ""The creation of the High Speed Sustainable Manufacturing Institute is a bold step in further establishing the United Kingdom in its place of the premier league of manufacturing engineering excellence world-wide.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department for Communities and Local Government is contributing £3.5million over three years to the High Speed Sustainable Manufacturing Institute.

2. It will be based at the Centre for Engineering and Manufacturing Excellence (CEME) at Rainham, Essex. CEME is a registered charity that operates an industry-led education and business campus in the heart of the Thames Gateway. CEME was created in 2002 as part of the Government's regeneration programme for the Thames Gateway region. It is a key catalyst for delivering growth in business and skills for the local economy.

3. The High Speed Sustainable Manufacturing Institute will focus on the discipline of Manufacturing Engineering. Manufacturing Engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the efficient production of industrial goods. It includes the design of production plant equipment and processes. This is an activity common to all manufacturing sectors and is particularly relevant to high volume operations.",24-Jul-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2189195.jpg,Eric Pickles visiting the new manufacturing institute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
251,http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/2190150,Communities Minister to attend Olympic football matches and see some of the key local growth projects in and around Manchester,improving-high-streets-and-town-centres,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,bob-neill,,"Bob Neill, Olympics Legacy and Growth Minister, will visit Manchester on Thursday, 26 July to attend the two Olympic football preliminary matches at Old Trafford.

This will include the Team GB men's first match against Senegal.

Mr Neill said:

> ""It is fantastic that the Olympics are finally upon us and high profile events such as this Team GB football match are a fabulous way to kick things off - that this event is taking place in Manchester shows these really are a Great Britain-wide games.
>
> ""It is projected that hosting the Olympic Football will generate an economic benefit of around £30 million for Greater Manchester. This will give the area a significant economic boost, and will leave a great Olympic legacy.
>
> ""My visit has also provided a wonderful opportunity to see, first hand, some of the key local growth projects in and around Manchester. The Media Enterprise Centre and the Enterprise Zone at Manchester Airport are truly world class projects. And The National Football Museum has given me the chance to catch up on my football history before seeing team GB make football history tonight (whatever the result!). They will all have a significant positive impact on the local economy providing local jobs, supporting local enterprise and attracting businesses to the area.""

There has been a huge effort from people across the UK to ensure that everything is ready for the Games, and Manchester has played a key role.  These preliminary matches are a great chance to show off the North West and celebrate the role that people, places and businesses from the region are playing in London 2012. This marks the beginning of a very exciting Games period.

During his visit the Minister will also attend the Enterprise Zone at Manchester Airport and two local European Regional Development Fund projects, both of which are playing a significant role in supporting the local economy and encouraging growth. The recently opened National Football Museum, located in the city centre, is already attracting international acclaim and will draw visitors into the area from far and wide. And within a stone's throw of Old Trafford at MediaCity in Salford the Minister will be shown some of the cutting edge facilities and technologies at the Media Enterprise Centre, another ERDF funded project, which is aiming to stimulate and support the growth of the media technology sector within the North West of England.

![High Street Illustration (Dermott Flynn)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2082239.jpg)Illustration by Dermott Flynn

Having received an overwhelming volume of high quality bids the Minister confirmed that those not selected to be Portas Pilots would not be left behind. The news comes as Shapps announced 15 new Portas Pilots, taking the total across the country to 27.

Mr Shapps issued a call to MPs from the 392 Town Teams not chosen, to come forward and sign a national pledge to become a Town Team Partner - enabling access to a package of support to their own town. The package of support is worth £5.5million nationwide.

### No high street left behind

Those that sign up to become Town Team Partners will receive backing from a multi-million pound support programme to help put elements of their plans into action. But they will also have the opportunity to:

  * Get access to events, workshops and seminars across the country addressing key challenges facing struggling town centres;
  * Receive direct mentoring support and visits from experts with a range of relevant backgrounds;
  * Directly benefit from the experience of the 27 Portas Pilots;
  * Meet regularly with town teams across the country to share their experiences and lessons learned; and
  * Join an online community to receive tips and advice from retail experts

The Town Team Partners will also benefit from a new web-based encyclopaedia - _100 Ways to Help the High Street_, which will be hosted and run by the Association of Town Centre Management. The ATCM will also work with the areas selected as Town Team Partners to help them progress their proposals.

Business in the Community will also marshal support from businesses, retailers and trade bodies both for the Town Team Partners and the 27 Portas Pilots.

Further details will be announced later this year.

This additional package of support forms part of a wider response to Mary Portas's Review, which was published last December. All town teams from across the country will also be able to bid for a £1million Future High Street X-Fund to reward the most effective and creative schemes to encourage people back to the town centres in 2013, and a £500,000 fund to help access set-up loans for new Business Improvement Districts.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today I'd like to congratulate the 15 town teams that, in the face of stiff competition, have been selected to be the next Portas Pilots. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, and I'm determined that we don't turn our backs on the other 392 Town Teams who put their plans forward to revive their high streets.
>
> ""That's why I'm calling on these communities, led by their MPs, to put themselves forward once again to become Town Team Partners. Each one that applies will benefit from a package of support to refine their plans and get the help and advice they need to bring their town centres back to life.
>
> ""I don't want to lose the incredible momentum and I want to know that no town is left behind after such an enthusiastic and imaginative response to Mary Portas's review. So alongside the 27 Portas Pilots across the country, these Town Team Partners will also be able to revive their high streets and make them the beating hearts of their communities once again.""

Martin Blackwell, chief executive of the Association of Town Centre Management, said:

> ""The response to the challenge created by the government's response to the Mary Portas report from communities in towns and cities across England was enormous. It is terrific to see the government acknowledging that groundswell of activity in such a positive way.
>
> ""To enhance this support ATCM is launching a new web based encyclopedia - _100 Ways to Help the High Street_ - which will be available this Friday to all areas and Town Teams, at [www.100ways.org.uk](http://www.100ways.org.uk) (external link).
>
> ""We look forward to taking the same collegiate approach to working with all the Portas Pilot and Town Team Partner towns that we have done in hundreds of towns and cities across the UK and Ireland for many years.""

### Second Round Winners

Mr Shapps today confirmed 15 new Portas Pilots, taking the total to 27.

Of these, three have been selected by the Mayor of London. Recognising how this initiative complements his efforts to regenerate the capital's high streets Boris Johnson has joined forces with Mr Shapps and is investing £300,000 to fund these additional pilots.

> ""I am thrilled that communities up and down the country have looked beyond the money and have been mobilised to create 'town teams' and demand more for their high streets. Whilst I shall continue to fight for the other 27 'recommendations' in my Review am looking forward to seeing fifteen more British towns putting their plans into action""

Mayor of London Boris Johnson said:

> ""Driving growth and creating jobs through the rejuvenation of London's high streets is at the heart of my mayoralty and the Portas pilot initiative is a fantastic way to help us achieve this.
>
> ""Through our regeneration drive we have already started reversing the decay of our high streets that had been allowed set in through long-term underinvestment.
>
> ""The selected pilots have been chosen for their innovative approach and commitment to community partnerships. We will work closely with them and ensure their successful ideas are replicated across other towns in London and the UK. I strongly believe the regeneration of High streets will help lead the way in steering our town centres out of recession and get these vital economic hubs booming again.""

These 15 new Portas pilots are in addition to the 12 winning Portas Pilots from the first round of the competition, who are already making strides to revive their high streets. These include:

### Notes to editors

1. More information about the pilots:

> #### Ashford
>
> The key priority for the Town Team will be to reinvigorate the town centre market, by testing plans for a 'stall for a tenner', in a new town centre market celebrating local produce and crafts made in Kent. The team will also look to better integrate the town centre and the nearby Ashford Designer Outlet.
>
> #### Berwick-upon-Tweed
>
> The Town Team's 'Beautiful Berwick' vision is to use local builders, communication companies and artists to improve shop fronts, signage, seating and advertising space over the course of a six-month campaign to improve the look of the high street.
>
> #### Braintree
>
> The Braintree Town Team's main focus is to provide support to the independent retailers and other businesses that occupy nearly two thirds of premises in the town centre. To do this, the Town Team will offer a mentoring service to these entrepreneurs, including support for business development planning, merchandising, access to finance, and using social media and the Internet to support business growth.
>
> #### Brighton
>
> The London Road area of Brighton has suffered from crime, vandalism and empty shops, however with nearby digital media companies, arts venues and good transport links the area has real potential. To address the issues the area faces, the Town Team plan to work with the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership and Local Action Team, and will pilot a subsidised radio scheme to allow businesses to share information on criminal activity in the area and improve links between traders.
>
> #### Hatfield
>
> The only New Town to be selected as a Portas Pilot, Hatfield will focus on making their high street a 'community hub' rather than purely for retail, by investing in a portable undercover staging area and events space in the town centre to host community events and activities. In addition, the Town Team plan to provide opportunities for start-up businesses and entrepreneurs to showcase their ideas at pop-up stalls during market days and at community events.
>
> #### London Borough of Lambeth - Lower Marsh and the Cut
>
> Lambeth's Town Team plan to tackle the high level of empty shops around Waterloo, creating 'satellite markets' outside empty frontages and working with local landlords to provide training and get tenants into vacant buildings. They also plan to revitalise the Lower Marsh street market, giving local students the chance to trial their designs on 'test days', giving local theatres the chance to perform in the area and encouraging schools to help young local entrepreneurs to set up stall.
>
> #### Leamington
>
> Leamington's Town Team are particularly keen to address the 21 per cent shop vacancy rate in their High Street. To do this, they have developed a HEART UP initiative to encourage independent retailers to occupy vacant units. In addition, the Town Team will address the derelict railway service in the town to turn it into striking landmarks and encourage more visitors.
>
> #### London Borough of Lewisham - Forest Hill, Kirkdale and Sydenham
>
> The Town Team in Lewisham plan to overhaul the empty shops in Forest Hill, Kirkdale and Sydenham, renovating 12 vacant properties and updating signage across the area. Two empty shops will be reinvented as community hubs, hosting exhibitions and business workshops.

>
> #### Liverpool - Lodge Lane
>
> Led by the Tiber Young People's Steering Group the bid, which has a strong level of local community support, focused on improving the local public square, and promoting business start-ups in the area - particularly through a new mentoring scheme. The Town Team will also offer training to young people on becoming entrepreneurs.
>
> #### Loughborough
>
> Loughborough has suffered from stiff retail competition from the high streets in nearby Leicester, Nottingham and Derby, and the Fosse Park out-of-town shopping centre. To address this, the Town Team is looking to involve students from the university in helping developing existing businesses by offering mentoring on social networking. The Town Team will also run retail masterclasses with Loughborough University and successful retailers.
>
> #### Lowestoft
>
> The priority for the Lowestoft Town Team is to increase footfall in the High Street. To do this, they plan to launch a mentoring scheme between larger and smaller traders, Town Rangers who will provide information to shoppers as well as security in the town and a new Lowestoft Town 'group' discount scheme, where retailers who sign up offer discounts to shoppers who shop regularly there. The Town Team also plan to introduce additional maps and marketing boards to highlight forthcoming attractions that the high street has to offer.
>
> #### Morecambe
>
> Morecambe has long suffered from high shop vacancy rates, which the Town Team are very keen to address. For this, the team are looking beyond retail to make the high street a social area, with a new community cafe where people will be able to get advice and support to take up business and training opportunities. All profits made from branding will be ploughed back into the local community to help regenerate the area.
>
> #### Rotherham
>
> With two large shopping parks competing for business nearby, Rotherham Town Team's focus will be to get residents to 'shop local'. The Team will emphasise the individuality of the local high street, working closely with independent local shops and providing training, support and business development grants to local retailers.
>
> #### Tiverton
>
> Tiverton has long suffered from being within easy distance of Exeter and its bustling high street. To tackle this, Tiverton's Town Team plan to turn a plot of unused land in the heart of the town into a coach park to attract the tourist parties that already visit neighbouring artisan towns. The Town Team are also keen to work with other pilots, to pass the lessons they learn from the process on to towns across the country.
>
> #### London Borough of Tower Hamlets - Chrisp Street, Watney Market, Roman Road
>
> The Town Team will use the strength of their highly innovative 'Ideas Stores' - combining the best of traditional library and information services with activities programmes - exploiting their high visitor numbers to run a series of programmes including NHS driven healthy food initiatives.

2. The successful bids come from mix of areas from a variety of town centres and high streets across a geographical spread including market towns, villages, large towns, new towns, coastal towns and suburban areas. The pilots cover both high / low average income levels and high / low empty shop vacancy rates.

3. The chosen pilots have demonstrated a transformational vision for their high street and strong support from the local community and a wide range of local partners to make it a reality. The lead partner clearly articulated this vision and demonstrated strong support from the local community and a wide range of local partners.

The pilots also demonstrated:

  * **strong leadership** - pilots areas clearly articulated and delivered a transformational vision for their high street
  * **commitment** - demonstrated maximum commitment to the Town Team approach amongst retailers, landlords, the local authority and the local community or community groups.
  * **potential for improvement** - clear articulation of the problems and challenges, including proposing solutions that would bring real change to their high street.
  * **innovation** - set out the most innovative ideas that would have maximum impact and can be replicated elsewhere.

4. The Mayor of London, recognising how this initiative complements his extensive efforts to regenerate the capital's high streets, is joining forces with the Department for Communities and Local Government to invest £300,000 to fund three additional London pilots.

The pilots will be selected by the Mayor this summer following a bidding process designed to attract the best ideas that will deliver jobs and growth to some of they city's high streets and town centres most affected by the economic downturn and underinvestment.

5. The Portas Pilots scheme is being supported by other organisations. These include:

  * **Arts Council England**, who will offer advice, expertise and potentially grant support to help develop the cultural and artistic elements of planning the pilots;
  * **Association of Town Centre Management (ATCM)** are offering pilots a free trial membership of the ATCM.
  * **Springboard Research Ltd** have agreed to provide access data and run workshops for pilots. Evidence based research is important to enable the pilots to get a thorough understanding of the issues that they face, the potential solutions
  * The **British Council of Shopping Centres** and the **British Property Federation** are coordinating a mentor scheme online so that pilot towns can access free specialist advice on issues like property and planning.
  * The **British Retail Consortium** are offering each of the Portas Pilot town teams a new free membership package, which will provide them with access to information about the current position of the sector and evolving BRC priorities and activity.

6. _The Portas Review: An independent review into the future of our High Streets_ was published on 13 December, 2011. The Review made ambitious recommendations on what can be done - by Government, local authorities and business - to help high streets deliver something new. The focus is on putting the heart back into the centre of our high streets, re-imagined as exciting social hubs for shopping learning, socialising and having fun.",25-Jul-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2082239.jpg,High Street Illustration (Dermott Flynn),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

![Baroness Hanham welcomes the Torch relay in Southwark](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2190725.jpg)Baroness Hanham with a young Olympics fan

The children had come together through Near Neighbours, a highly successful programme funded by The Department. The programme uses the parish infrastructure of the Church of England to bring people from diverse communities and different faiths together to get to know each other better, take action on local issues and help them transform their local neighbourhoods.

As the crowds watched the torch 'kiss' from the church steps, East London Near Neighbours co-ordinator the Rev. Tim Clapton encouraged the crowds of all backgrounds and faiths to recite a pledge of community spirit.

Following the torch procession, children from the local Rockingham Youth Group - a recipient of Near neighbours funding - hosted an impromptu Question Time, quizzing Baroness Hanham on the forthcoming Games and the work of the Department.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""It was wonderful to be able to join these young Olympics fans cheering on the torch bearers as the Torch arrived in Southwark on the final leg of its journey through our great capital.
>
> ""These excited young Olympians participating in the arts and crafts games have done so through the Near Neighbours project which is bringing people of different faiths and backgrounds together through practical action, underlining the crucial role faith groups play in all our communities.
>
> ""I have really loved meeting these young people and enjoyed their enthusiasm and energy. I applaud the work done by Fr Ray Andrews at St George the Martyr Church and the inspirational work of The Rev. Tim Clapton.""

But while a key reason for his visit was to attend the Olympic Football matches at Old Trafford, he also found time to visit some key projects within the Manchester area, including the landmark and internationally acclaimed National Football Museum in the city centre.

Museum Director and founder Kevin Moore was on hand to show the Minister, a keen football fan, around the four floors of football artefacts, memorabilia and interactive games and displays. The Museum which has received financial backing from Manchester City Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund, has also received £3.8 million from the North West European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) programme, managed by Bob Neill's department, the Department for Communities and Local Government.

The Minister said:

> ""This is a truly world class attraction which seizes on the local love of football and brings it to life in a fantastic way. The museum will bring many thousands of visitors into the city and the surrounding area and will have a major impact on the local economy, local supply chains and local people.
>
> ""I am hugely impressed with what this museum has to offer - an intriguing and inspiring collection complimented wonderfully by the exciting interactive games and displays. I'm definitely coming back so I can spend a whole day here - if you like football you'll love this place.""

The Museum, which has an annual visitor target of 350,000, has been extremely busy since it opened at the beginning of July. Entry to the venue is free with charges only made for some of the interactive games, which include a life-size penalty shoot-out simulator.

Museum Director Kevin Moore said:

> ""Designers asked me if they could just reduce the length of the penalty simulator by 10 centimetres to make it easier to build - I said absolutely not, it's got to be the full 12 yards. We've worked hard to make sure everything is authentic across the whole museum.""

During his day in Manchester, the Minister also visited the Enterprise Zone facilities at Manchester Airport and University Hospital South Manchester and another ERDF project, the soon to be opened Media Enterprise Centre at MediaCity.

A new local standards regime, outlined in the Localism Act, has replaced the bureaucratic and controversial Standards Board, which ministers believed had become a vehicle for petty, partisan and sometimes malicious, allegations of councillor misconduct that sapped public confidence in local democracy.

In the drive for greater transparency across all Government all councillors have been required to register certain pecuniary interests, including trade union dealings on a publicly available local register since July. Deliberate failure to declare interests could result in a criminal conviction.

To help make sure the new approach is properly understood, the Government is publishing a practical guide, which shows the new local standards strike a common sense balance between electoral accountability and personal privacy. It clarifies specific issues like urgency of declarations; personal information safety; handling spouse or partner interests and gold plating.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""The Standards Board regime led to an explosion in petty, partisan and malicious complaints that dragged down the reputation of local government, as well as suppressing freedom of speech. We have published a practical guide that shows how the new local standards strike a common sense balance between electoral accountability and personal privacy.
>
> ""As a former councillor myself, I know councillors are motivated about doing a good job for the local residents they serve. Instead of having hundreds of expensive and frivolous investigations hanging over their heads, local councillors should now be free to get on with their jobs.""

1. _Openness and transparency on personal interests: A guide for councillors_ is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/personalinterestsguide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/personalinterestsguide).

The Minister has written to all councillors and chief executive highlighting the guidance [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/personalinterestsletter](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/personalinterestsletter).

2. The Standards Board for England ceased its regulatory functions on 31 January 2012, and was formally abolished on 31 March 2012. The abolition of the Standards Board was included in the Localism Act. The Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November 2011. _A plain English guide to the Localism Act_ is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localismplainenglishupdate](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localismplainenglishupdate).

3. Since 1 July 2012, all standards matters became the responsibility of local authorities, to be handled under the new arrangements, which include a code of conduct based on 'Nolan principles', the involvement of an independent person in allegations of misconduct, a register of members' pecuniary interests, and a new criminal offence for failing to declare or register pecuniary interests. The new arrangements reflect the Government's policy that elected representatives should continue to declare financial interests in an open and transparent way, to avoid conflicts of interest especially on issues such as planning applications or financially benefiting from the issuing of council contracts.

> ""The fact that so many people are enjoying both the sailing and the free events here shows these really are Great Britain-wide games.

During his visit the Minister will also visit local businesses including the innovative pop-up store 'Quba' in Brewers quay. And he will watch some of the Olympic events on the large screens on the Live site on the beach with the thousands of local supporters.

There has been a huge effort from people across the UK to ensure that everything is ready for the Games, and Weymouth and Portland has played a key role. The whole Olympics package on offer in the local area is a great chance to show off Weymouth and Portland, and celebrate the role that people, places and businesses from the region are playing in London 2012.

### Notes to editors

**1. South West and Sport**

The South West region has hosted more than 40 pre-Games training camps for many of the world's sailing teams who have trained at the new Weymouth and Portland Sailing Academy, the Castle Cove Sailing Club and Weymouth College.

The Government's Champion for Active and Safer Communities, visited projects in Wakefield, West Yorkshire and Great Yarmouth, Norfolk that are being funded to test ideas to help reduce problem drinking and related anti-social behaviour.

In Wakefield, 'Positive Choices', a grassroots project that pulls together proven methods for tackling problem drinking and run by the local Neighbourhood Policing Team, is working with community groups and young people to achieve a long term, measurable impact on the way they perceive, experience and consume alcohol.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2196899.jpg)Baroness Newlove with young members of TS Warrior, the local cadet unit in Great Yarmouth

On a tour of Castleford's new youth facility, 'The Hut', Lady Newlove said:

> ""Positive Choices is a real community partnership backed by the local authority and police. But most importantly, the young people of Castleford will be actively involved throughout.
>
> ""It is vital they are part of the solution and their voices heard at all times. I'm confident that over the next two years this inclusive approach will deliver real results in tackling the blight of binge and under-age drinking.""

Inspector Dave Bugg of the Castleford Neighbourhood Policing Team said:

> ""Securing the £90,000 investment from the Department of Community and Local Government Alcohol Fund was hugely positive for the town and its young people and we already have seen the opening of excellent new faciities making a difference to the lives of local youngsters such as the Hut.
>
> ""There are a lot of good kids in this area and experience has shown us that where good facilities are provided, the whole community benefits in the long term.""

Later in the week Baroness Newlove visited Great Yarmouth to meet local residents running 'The Den', a Life Skills Project  offering training sessions on everything from cooking, budgeting, running a home and parenting through to support on more complex issues such as drug and alcohol misuse and behaviour issues including anti-social behaviour and domestic violence.

The two projects are part of a national network of 20 grassroots programmes working to tackle binge and underage drinking and anti-social behaviour which Baroness Newlove is supporting.

While in Great Yarmouth Lady Newlove officially launched a training boat - the Newlove - to be used by young members of TS Warrior, the local cadet unit. Funded by Community Alcohol Partnerships, the boat will be used to give older members of the Warrior, the opportunity to participate in hands-on experience, training and qualifications, which they can then use to get jobs in offshore industries in the town.

Last weekend marked the Muslim contribution to A Year of Service, which through A Taste of Faith and A Time to Give encouraged mosques and community centres to open their doors to their local communities and also to visiting international athletes and home grown sport stars.

On Saturday, Great Britain hockey player Darren Chessman attended an interfaith meal at the Central Mosque of Brent where the local community had helped to prepare food hampers to be donated to local charity Homeless Concern.

![Afghan National Olympic team attending an Iftar meal at Palmers Green Mosque](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2196806.jpg)Afghan National Olympic team attending an Iftar meal at Palmers Green Mosque

On Sunday, thirty members of the Afghan National Olympic team including judo competitor Ajmal Faizzadatook and 100m sprinter Tahmina Kohistani took time out from the London Games to enjoy a celebratory interfaith meal at Palmers Green Mosque. The mosque had invited people of all faiths to meet the Afghan team and come together for an Iftar, the meal when Muslims break their fast during the Islamic month of Ramadan.

The Olympic Games are providing the opportunity to unite people from different backgrounds, cultures, and nations through a shared interest in sport and Mohammad Tariq Fediq, Centre Manager at Palmers Green Mosque, said that the presence of the Afghan Olympic team had been ""inspirational"".

> ""It was a great community gathering. It was a good opportunity for us to show the rest of the world how Muslims break the fast because the month is a month of sharing. It also showed the British Muslim hospitality.""

Throughout the month of Ramadan, communities across the country have been coming together for shared meals from Birmingham to Southampton with more events still to come.

Speaking of the Muslim Contribution to A Year of Service, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Muslim communities across the UK traditionally help others by supporting charities and volunteering throughout the year. These good works are highlighted by the Government-backed A Year of Service programme, which is seeing Muslim communities - in common with religious groups across the nation all year - opening their doors to those of other faiths and of none during Ramadan to take part in volunteering initiatives. Whether it has been creating food hampers for the less well off, or an Iftar community meal reaching out to those in need, each unique event has brought people together in an admirable way.""

Mr Shapps said that the Government's work to reduce the deficit and help keep interest rates at a record low and mortgages affordable, combined with a raft of support to help struggling homeowners, is helping to ensure that repossession remains the last resort for millions.

Latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show the number of homes taken into possession to have gone down by 11 per cent on the previous quarter to 8,500, 9 per cent less than in the same period in 2011. This is the lowest figure since the final quarter of 2010.

These figures come as the latest forecast from leading academic Professor John Muellbauer predict a brighter picture for both repossessions and arrears compared to his 2010 forecast.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

  * ""Repossession is a frightening prospect for any homeowner, and this Government has worked hard to help keep the pressure off by tackling the deficit and keeping interest rates at a record low.
  * ""In these tough economic times, it's good to know that the protections in place are preventing the worst for many families. But while repossessions remain lower than anticipated, there's no room to be complacent.
""The advice and financial support is in place to prevent anyone from reaching that last resort measure of repossession. I would urge anyone feeling the pinch to take advantage, and seek help as soon as possible.""

### Help for Homeowners

Just as the Government is providing help for people wanting to get on the property ladder, a range of support is also available to keep them in their homes. This help includes:

  * A £20 million Preventing Repossession fund giving every council the opportunity to offer small interest-free loans to struggling homeowners and ensure that court desks can offer on-the-day advice for those facing the prospect of repossession.
  * The Mortgage Rescue Scheme, which has been refocused to deliver better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to housing associations and tighter caps on property prices and repair costs, to ensure as many people as possible can benefit from it. More than £200 million has been invested in the scheme and is now available through councils and housing associations to ensure help is targeted at homeowners most likely to benefit from it.
  * The Directgov website: [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) - which has lots of free advice and information. Helpful advice is also on hand from organisations including Citizens Advice and the National Debtline.

Mr Pickles is concerned that too much development is being stalled because of economically unrealistic agreements negotiated between councils and developers at the height of the housing boom. This results in no development, no regeneration and no community benefits at all when agreements are no longer economically viable.

The deals, known legally as Section 106 agreements, require developers to make a financial contribution to the community or provide housing, amenities or infrastructure as part of their planning permission.

Teams of intermediaries will now offer a free-of-charge advice and support service to councils and developers and will be available to help kick-start renegotiations of these deals to stop them being a barrier to getting building underway.

### Councils to benefit from expert advice

Brokers will begin work immediately with an initial wave of councils that are keen to address obstacles that are preventing development in their area before working with other councils around the country. The experts will:

  * provide technical expertise to unlock negotiations
  * act as go-betweens in disputes
  * offer access to a range of support services.

The Government is today also launching a consultation that proposes giving developers the option to ask councils to renegotiate Section 106 obligations if they were agreed prior to April 2010. Currently these obligations cannot be renegotiated for five years once a council refuses a request for voluntary renegotiation by a developer.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Tackling problems with stalled development is essential to getting builders back on moth-balled sites and building the homes we need. There is huge potential in sites to boost local economies and we simply cannot afford to have them lying idle because of earlier agreements that are no longer viable.
>
> ""The support and advice the expert brokers will offer is one of the many measures we have introduced to get development underway and I hope councils grab this chance to make use of the support we are offering.
>
> ""Our reforms to the planning system are already cutting planning red tape and making the system simpler and more accessible to communities and businesses. And further changes we're introducing will simplify national planning policy even more and streamline the planning application process.""

Councils in Leeds, Ipswich, Corby, Swindon, Ashford, Gloucester, Kirklees, Carlisle, Northumberland and Durham will the first to benefit from the support offered by the expert brokers and will identify key stalled sites they want to see back up and running.

And opening up the renegotiation process further will provide another new opportunity to help get developments back on track, provide affordable housing and bring wider benefits for communities.

Ministers are clear that any renegotiations of Section 106 agreements will not remove the developer's obligation to provide critical infrastructure or other contributions to offset the effects of the development, and they should not result in land banking.

Deals need to be realistic and deliverable and will take commitment from both councils and developers to ensure they are delivered swiftly. And councils need to ensure they continue to consider local decision making processes when agreeing new deals.

Teams of expert brokers, along with officials from the Department and the Homes and Communities Agency will join together to work with the councils.

Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, said:

> ""As a sector we need to see as many stalled sites as possible unlocked to deliver much needed new homes. We are currently using our investment to do this through Get Britain Building, while our support in unlocking large projects in the planning system - through our ATLAS team - is highly valued by local authorities and the private sector.
>
> ""So where sites are stalled because of agreements signed under very different economic conditions, we will work with councils to help see how we can get them moving again while meeting the needs and priorities of local communities.""

It is estimated that there are currently more than 1,400 housing schemes of more than 10 housing units with planning permission that are stalled and unblocking these developments is a key part of the Government's Housing Strategy.

The support and advice being offered to councils is just one of a number of measures the Government is taking to help boost development. The £570million Get Britain Building fund is tackling the housing shortage and creating jobs and the £770million Growing Places Fund is providing local areas with flexible funding to get the infrastructure built needed to build new homes.

Today's announcement is a key step in encouraging all local authorities to consider renegotiating Section 106 agreements where development has stalled.

In March 2011, the chief planning officer wrote to planning authorities asking them to review agreements. The new National Planning Policy Framework requires councils to take account of market conditions and be sufficiently flexible to prevent development being stalled.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation document on renegotiating S106 agreements can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/renegotiationobligationsconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/renegotiationobligationsconsult).

2. The consultation proposes to amend the Town and Country Planning (Modification and Discharge of Planning Obligations) Regulations 1992 (""the 1992 Regulations""), in relation to England.

3. Glenigan Data, March 2012, estimates that there are currently 1,400 housing schemes of over 10 housing units with planning permission that are stalled.

4. Section 106A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 allows voluntary renegotiation of a planning obligation at any time. Where voluntary agreement cannot be reached there may be a formal request to reconsider an obligation when that obligation is five years old. The local authority must take a decision on such a request. If the local authority decision is not to renegotiate terms then there is a right to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate.

5. The consultation proposes that for planning obligations agreed on or prior to 6 April 2010, the relevant local authority can be asked to formally renegotiate the terms one month after the introduction of new regulations. In effect this will mean that the formal period of five years is reduced to between two and half and five years for these obligations. For all planning obligations agreed after 6 April 2010, the period will remain at five years.

6. New statutory tests were introduced for most planning obligations on 6 April 2010 which ensure that obligations agreed after that date must only cover what is necessary to make the development acceptable, must be directly related to the development and reasonable in scale and kind.

8. The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act and recently announced a number of measures to kick-start growth and reduce planning red tape. These include proposals to make it easier to re-use some existing buildings without needing planning permission, streamlining the amount of paperwork needed for a planning application, speeding up planning appeal decisions and reducing the volume of planning guidance.

The £24million Coastal Communities Fund was launched earlier this year to provide coastal towns with money to help pay for projects that can transform and diversify seaside economies.

Mr Pickles made the announcement on a visit to Bournemouth today to see first hand how one project will use the grant to create Europe's first National Coastal Tourism Academy that will help create hundreds of jobs in the coming years.

The funding can be used for a variety of projects including skills training, apprenticeship schemes and enterprises that rejuvenate seaside assets or that exploit emerging industries.

Today's first round of successful schemes in England will receive grants of up to £2million each to use on projects that creates local jobs, that supports coastal tourism and development and that boosts the inshore fisheries industry.

Mr Pickles also revealed that next year the Coastal Communities Fund will be increased by £4million to £28million, a 17 per cent increase on this year. The fund is open to coastal towns across the United Kingdom and is funded by the Exchequer.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""There is huge potential in our coastal towns that goes way beyond them only being places we visit for seaside day trips and holidays. We are seeing opportunities being developed all the time by new industries and the Government is determined to help our coastal towns make the most of them.
>
> ""This money will help those towns tap into these enterprises and create the skills and jobs that will benefit the whole community. We cannot afford to waste this chance which is why the Government is committed to increasing the fund next year.
>
> ""The successful projects in this first round have enormous potential to make a real difference to their communities that will be far reaching. And this is just the beginning with our fund set to help many more coastal towns in the months to come.""

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said:

> ""This first round of successful awards under the Coastal Communities Fund will directly support local communities to regenerate their local area. The fund will enable councils, businesses, charities and social enterprises to create and protect jobs and training opportunities for thousands of people across the UK.
>
> ""We are today able to announce that the fund will expand again next year to £28million. It is right that the contribution these communities make to the development of the Crown Estate's marine assets is recognised and rewarded and I look forward to another round of successful, innovative bids later in the year.""

### First round winners

The successful first round winners and their fund allocation are:

  * **Barrow in Furness** - £900,000 to support the 'Unleashing Growth in Coastal Furness' initiative which aims to create 275 full-time jobs and more than 85 part time jobs;
  * **Bournemouth Borough Council** - £2million over two years to create Europe's first National Coastal Tourism Academy (NCTA). They will also use funds for activities including support for coastal tourism businesses, a resort wide customer care programme and coastal tourism research and development. The project aims to create 165 tourism jobs over three years in Bournemouth and 2,100 nationwide;
  * **National Lobster Hatchery, Padstow, Cornwall** - £150,500 to provide four new jobs and 15 training and volunteering opportunities at this social enterprise which maintains and develops the stock of a commercial species of lobster and runs a visitor centre which promotes sustainable and responsible marine management.
  * **RAK Maritime Project in East Anglia** - £757,000 to provide maritime training to 63 young people each year over two years to support the renewable energy industry in East Anglia.
  * **South East Food Group Partnership** - £25,000 from their £80,000 bid to support the in-shore fisheries industry of South East England under the name 'Local Fish for Local People'. The project will create 15 full-time sales posts for fishermen or family members.
  * **Suffolk County Council** - £762,000 to create 200 new employer-led apprenticeships to develop skills needed in the low carbon energy sector in coastal communities in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex.

Further successful seaside town bidders will be announced later in the year.

The fund is financed by the Government. Money is allocated to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on the basis of revenue generated by the Crown Estate's marine assets and is administered and distributed in partnership with the Big Lottery Fund's 'BIG Fund'.

There has been enormous interest in the fund from projects in England with 129 expressions of interest received for this first initial round of funding and a further 501 expressions received for a future round which covers more complex bids.

### Notes to editors

1. The creation of a UK-wide Coastal Communities Fund was announced by the Government last year to provide grants on a bid basis to support the economic development of coastal communities.

2. The fund is equal to 50 per cent of the revenues generated by the Crown Estate's marine assets. Based on the Crown Estate's Marine revenues in 2010/11 (£47.4million) the overall fund is worth £23.7million beginning in 2012. Funds can be used to support both capital and revenue projects and communities are encouraged to match funds with other pots of money.

The fund is directly linked to the revenue raised in each country. In April 2013 the fund will be broken down as follows:


3. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have country specific arrangements and work in partnership with the BIG Fund, the non-Lottery funding operation of the Big Lottery Fund, to deliver the money. The Big Lottery Fund has powers to deliver funding from non-lottery sources.

The Department for Communities and Local Government has taken its transparency pledge to a new level by publishing all spend data over £250, Secretary of State, Eric Pickles announced today.

As part of the Government's commitment to transparency, accountability and openness, all central government departments now publish their monthly spending online.

This department has been publishing details of all goods and services spent over £500 matching the level required of councils since August 2010.

As one of Government's transparency trailblazers that is now being extended to include all transactions above a new low threshold of £250. This will mean more information on typical items such as travel expenses, publications, office supplies and mobile phone bills for the first time.

Mr Pickles encouraged any armchair auditors to scrutinise the Department's data to see at a glance exactly where taxpayers money is being spent.

The Government's [transparency code for councils](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode) has already seen all local authorities publish their spending over £500 online and open every aspect of business up to public scrutiny including, tenders, contracts senior pay, councillor expenses and voluntary sector funding. The Localism Act requires local authorities to be transparent about how senior salaries are set through the publication of annual pay statements.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I firmly believe the more open we are about spending the more we can root out waste, avoid duplication and increase value for money for taxpayers.
>
> ""Every member of the public has a right to know - and a right to challenge - how every penny of their hard earned cash is being spent by Government.
>
> ""Our quest for greater transparency has led us to set a new marker in the sand - from today our books will now be open right down to £250.""

217,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2200471,Prevention is best cure for homelessness,providing-housing-support-for-older-and-vulnerable-people,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,grant-shapps,,"Government commits to early help for those at risk of losing their home

A new report today sets out a cross-Government approach to ensuring that anyone at risk of homelessness gets help at the earliest possible stage to prevent them from losing their home.

The [Making Every Contact Count report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/makingeverycontactcount) details clear commitments from Government to stop the slide towards homelessness in its tracks and ensure that this country's strong safety net of support for those without a roof over their head remains an absolute last resort.

Alongside this Housing Minister Grant Shapps reaffirmed ongoing efforts to ensure no-one has to spend more than one night on the streets, with a further £3.5 million for more homelessness help and to roll out the No Second Night Out initiative across the country.

### Making every contact count

Mr Shapps said that today's report would give councils, charities, health services and the police a blueprint to work together to ensure that families and vulnerable people at risk of homelessness are offered help early, no matter who they turn to first.

It sets out the Government's clear commitment to helping them achieve:

  * earlier support for young people, former prisoners, and patients with mental health, drug or alcohol problems;
  * better cross-service work between the voluntary sector, councils, health services and the justice system;
  * financial advice and jobseeking support through the voluntary sector, Jobcentre Plus and the work programme;
  * new funding mechanisms, including the Government's innovative new payment-by-results scheme; and
  * a new homelessness 'gold standard' that all local services should aim to achieve, setting the benchmark for services across the country.

The Minister said that this early intervention approach is backed up today by new statistics which show that 199,000 households were last year given help to stay in their homes or find new places to live. This vital support, such as repossession, tenancy or debt advice and re-housing services, can set many people back on track before they face losing their home.

### More support for rough sleepers

A further £3.5 million to 21 homelessness charities will support help and accommodation schemes for rough sleepers and extend the No Second Night Out initiative to eight more areas - Manchester, Plymouth, Great Yarmouth, North Devon, Taunton, Gloucestershire, Chichester and Worcestershire.

First introduced in London, the No Second Night Out project works with members of the public to quickly identify people sleeping rough locally and provides them with the support they need to get themselves off the streets Mr Shapps wants to see the initiative rolled out across the country.

Today's funding will support:

  * two 'Nightstop' emergency accommodation service for young people prevent them from living on the streets, or living long-term in B&Bs;
  * Housing First accommodation for ex rough sleepers help them rebuild their lives and get into long term housing rather than hostels;
  * a No Second Night Out project and a supported private rented homes scheme for rough sleepers in Plymouth;
  * a No Second Night Out team at Worcestershire's St Paul's Hostel to work with rough sleepers and support those moving to long term accommodation; and
  * improving co-ordination and information sharing between day centres and voluntary services in Manchester's Day Centres, including a No Second Night Out service.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We have some of the strongest protections in the world to safeguard people from homelessness, despite trying economic times, with homelessness in this country lower than for 28 of the last 30 years. But more can always be done.
>
> ""No single voluntary service, government agency, council or government department can prevent homelessness alone - but working together we can make a big impact. Every single contact these vulnerable people have with our public services - from council drop-ins to healthcare visits - should be made to count, turning prevention into the cure for anyone facing the real and frightening prospect of sleeping on the streets.
>
> ""And for those who still fall through the cracks, a further £3.5 million of Government money to help rough sleepers and roll out our No Second Night Out pledge across the country means that anyone facing losing their home and sleeping rough will get the support they need and deserve.""

The flag, also flying at 10 Downing Street and other government departments, will fly outside Eland House - alongside the Union Flag - until the end of the Games on the 9 September.

The flag bears the symbol of the Paralympics which is composed of three separate agitos coloured red, blue, and green, encircling a single point, on a white field. The agito, translated as ""I move"" in Latin, is a symbol of movement in the shape of an asymmetrical crescent.

Social tenants who have been stuck in homes that no longer meet their needs are seizing the opportunity to up sticks through the _HomeSwap Direct_ scheme, boosting their chances of getting a job, living nearer to family or simply improving their quality of life, Housing Minister Grant Shapps announced today.

The Minister welcomed latest figures showing that there are nearly 6,000 searches a day conducted on _HomeSwap Direct_ - an online scheme that shows social homes available for swaps across the country. The total number of searches since it launched in October 2011 is shortly expected to hit the 1.5million milestone.

For the first time _HomeSwap Direct_ has allowed tenants to easily look outside the service provided by their own landlord and be given a choice about where they live. With the scheme being online, it has made advertised swaps much more accessible for all tenants and the possibility of moving house just a click away.

The scheme has transformed the way in which tenants can look for properties and boosted their prospects of moving - whether for work, to be closer to family or for a property better suited to their needs.

Previously, tenants wanting to move were restricted to swapping properties through a scheme chosen by their landlord - effectively meaning only a partial swap scheme existed. _HomeSwap Direct_ gives tenants access to a much wider selection of properties than ever before.

Some of the success stories of _HomeSwap Direct_ include:

  * Syvie from Coventry found a job in London. She registered on House Exchange in March and moved in June. It would have been too expensive for her to commute to her new job and says the service meant she didn't have to ""live temporarily with family members""
  * Claudia had lived in her small village home in Norfolk for 12 years but needed to reduce her car journeys. She was able to swap with a family in Norwich looking for a more rural setting. ""I'm delighted with my new home, there was such a large selection, but I know I've got the right one for me.""
  * Mark had been living in Greenwich for 14 years and wanted to move out to nearer his family in Kent. With his mother Anne's help, Mark moved four months later. ""I was able to help Mark find his exchange with the benefit of HomeSwap Direct which made it much easier"" she said.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years, social tenants were stuck in the ridiculous situation where they didn't have the same freedom of choice as everyone else and could only swap homes with those using the same service as their landlord - or face competition from those higher up the waiting lists.
>
> ""_HomeSwap Direct_ has challenged this lazy consensus that trapped people in their homes. Instead, tenants are taking power back to arrange their own home swap by viewing properties available not just in their neighbourhood, but across the whole country.
>
> ""And with nearly 6,000 searches every day, and nearly 1.5million since the its launch, this successful scheme is clearly opening doors that were simply closed to social tenants, giving them a chance to improve their job prospects, live closer to family or simply move to a home better suited to their changing needs.""

### Notes to editors

1. _HomeSwap Direct_ brings together four internet-based providers of mutual exchange services (HomeSwapper, House Exchange, Abritas and LHS (Locata)) to offer tenants more choice over where they live.

2. A membership agreement which has been developed by Government and joined by these providers is available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website. This sets out the framework under which information will be shared by providers, the technical requirements of the scheme and the processes by which new members can apply to join.

Star of the British design industry Sir Terence Conran is to work with the Government to help create a new competition to give communities a chance to design their own neighbourhoods, Housing Minister Grant Shapps announced today.

It comes as Sir Terence and the Minister call on housebuilders to involve local people as early as possible in the design of new homes - helping to encourage communities to say yes to new housing.

The competition will be launched at a forthcoming summit this Autumn with communities invited to submit their designs for Sir Terence and other design industry stalwarts to judge.

It comes as Mr Shapps lays down the gauntlet to developers to tackle the mistaken belief among too many people that new-build properties are potential 'homes from hell'.

### Designing with local needs in mind

At the forthcoming summit, Sir Terence and Grant Shapps will urge developers to get the public involved in their design process from the very start - ensuring the homes they want and need are built in their area, meeting local demand and making them easier to sell.

But Mr Shapps will argue there is another benefit to community involvement - proving to sceptics that new-build properties are well-built and of good quality design.

The Minister will say that all too often, tales of badly designed 'homes from hell' give new developments a bad reputation before they even get off the ground - when in fact many new build homes are at the height of modern design.

Polls have shown that a significant number of prospective buyers believe that new-builds are badly designed and built. And three-quarters of people would embrace more housing in their area if they knew it was better designed.

Mr Shapps will say it is unfair to tar all newly built homes with the same brush, and will call on developers to ""prove the pessimists wrong"" by taking more responsibility to get local communities back on side.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""I'm delighted that Sir Terence Conran, a leading light of the design industry, is helping us launch this competition, which will harness the creativity of communities up and down the country as they consider how they want their local areas to look.
>
> ""But this is part of a wider point about the need to build more homes, which can't happen without getting local people onside and turning NIMBYs into YIMBYs (Yes in My Back Yard). To do this, residents must be involved in the design of new developments from the outset - helping to build the homes communities want and need and meeting demand from local buyers.
>
> ""And by doing this, housebuilders can finally tackle the belief that new-builds are potential 'homes from hell', proving the pessimists wrong and clearly demonstrating how well-designed and built their properties really are.""

Sir Terence Conran said:

> ""The design of an area has a significant and lasting impact on the quality of life of its residents - it's therefore vital that local people have a say over how their communities look and feel.

""I want the competition to inspire communities up and down the country to really think about the places in which they want to live, what they want to see and how they can make a difference. I look forward to launching it later this year, and seeing how creative Britain can be.""

The Government is putting the framework in place for developers to engage their neighbours early.

  * New **local plans**, introduced in planning reforms, encourage people's active involvement in neighbourhood planning.
  * The new **Community Right to Build** allows communities to approve local developments without the need for the normal planning process.
  * The **Community Infrastructure Levy** raises funds from new developments to build the public infrastructure the neighbourhood wants, like park improvements or a new health centre.
  * The **New Homes Bonus** lets communities see the benefits of local growth by rewarding new developments.

![Garden fork](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1894407.jpg)New, simple 'how to' advice to inspire communities to spot a plot of disused green spaces in their local area to use for food growing was published today by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.

A recent survey revealed that nearly two thirds of adults want to grow their own food. Unfortunately it is increasingly difficult as local authority allotments are significantly oversubscribed - with waiting lists over ten times longer than those in 1996.

Today's [publication](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/foodgrowingguide) gives local people practical advice on new ways to get access to less conventional sources of land and green space to grow their own food as well as suggestions for wider community involvement, helpful tips on how to get funding and examples of projects already in bloom.

New ways to revive derelict sites and powers to preserve local green spaces for the greater community good are examples of how the Government is helping communities to take greater control of their local area. Measures in the [Localism Act](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/localismbill/) such as using new [Neighbourhood Planning](http://www.communities.gov.uk/communities/communityrights/neighbourhoodplanning/) powers and [Community Right to Bid](http://www.communities.gov.uk/communities/communityrights/righttobid/) give communities a way to takeover unmaintained public land or badly run allotments themselves.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The practical advice we have published today can really help plant the seeds of garden growing and turn disused land into thriving green areas for the whole community. With so many people looking to grow their own food there's lots of great tips to help people look outside the allotment and spot a plot in more unconventional places to start community gardens.""
>
> ""Our Localism Act powers can really help all those with budding green fingers to find a way to grow a bumper crop for their family, win at the summer fete or create new community gardens up and down the country.""

Environment Secretary, Caroline Spelman said:

> ""This is great news for communities and will allow them to transform local spaces and grow their own fruit and veg. Growing your own food can have huge benefits and I hope that people all over the country will be inspired to get outside and get planting.""

Many community groups have already taken action to transform their local areas such as:

  * **The Ebury Bridge Gardening Club in Pimlico**, London is run by local residents. Their hard work and efforts have rejuvenated a disused run-down area into a unique award winning community garden for the estate's community.
  * **Stewarts Road Adventure Playground in Lambeth**, London was deemed unsafe. With the support of Groundwork London, volunteers revived the area to include a vegetable garden, chicken houses, beehives, pond and relaxation area. What started as a few simple raised beds quickly became a thriving food growing project. The project continues to give to the community with workshops for young people to learn about food growing.
  * **Arkwright Meadows Community Gardens in Nottingham** has become an oasis for local residents and other visitors to enjoy after local residents used funding from the Big Lottery Fund to transform a disused playing field. The site is now a thriving part of the local community providing mini-plots for local residents to grow their own food, after-school gardening clubs, and a tyre garden - utilising recycled truck and tractor tyres as raised beds, used by local schools to learn about food growing.

Royal Horticultural Society Community Programmes Manager said:

> ""The RHS knows that community gardening provides untold benefits, boosting people's health and wellbeing and strengthening the ties that bring neighbourhoods together. With more than 5,000 groups involved in the RHS community gardening campaigns, we welcome any steps to help local people transform disused spaces.""

Groundwork UK said:

> ""Groundwork has been supporting communities to improve their local environment and their own health and well-being for 30 years. Food growing is an activity which can bring communities together but which can also create skills and nurture enterprise. We know that more and more people want to get active and grow and welcome the additional support and guidance being provided.""

Ministers have put new regulations before Parliament that would come into force next month to extend the rights of people to attend all meetings of a council's executive, its committees and subcommittees.

The changes will result in greater public scrutiny. The existing media definition will be broadened to cover organisations that provide internet news thereby opening up councils to local online news outlets. Individual councillors will also have stronger rights to scrutinise the actions of their council.

Any executive decision that would result in the council incurring new spending or savings significantly affecting its budget or where it would affect the communities of two or more council wards will have to be taken in a more transparent way as a result.

Crucially councils will no longer be able to cite political advice as justification for closing a meeting to the public and press. In addition any intentional obstruction or refusal to supply certain documents could result in a fine for the individual concerned.

The changes clarify the limited circumstances where meetings can be closed, for example, where it is likely that a public meeting would result in the disclosure of confidential information. Where a meeting is due to be closed to the public, the council must now justify why that meeting is to be closed and give 28 days notice of such decision.

As a consequence of the greater levels of transparency around meetings, the Government is able to remove unnecessary and bureaucratic red tape on forward plans introduced by legislation in 2000.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Every decision a council takes has a major impact on the lives of local people so it is crucial that whenever it takes a significant decision about local budgets that affect local communities whether it is in a full council meeting or in a unheard of sub-committee it has got to be taken in the full glare of all the press and any of the public.
>
> ""Margaret Thatcher was first to pry open the doors of Town Hall transparency. Fifty years on we are modernising those pioneering principles so that every kind of modern journalists can go through those doors - be it from the daily reporter, the hyper-local news website or the armchair activist and concerned citizen blogger - councils can no longer continue to persist with a digital divide.""

Chris Taggart, of OpenlyLocal.com, which has long championed the need to open council business up to public scrutiny, added:

> ""In a world where hi-definition video cameras are under £100 and hyperlocal bloggers are doing some of the best council reporting in the country, it is crazy that councils are prohibiting members of the public from videoing, tweeting and live-blogging their meetings.""

### Notes to Editors

1. [The Local Authorities (Executive Arrangements) (Meetings and Access to Information) (England) Regulations 2012 (the 2012 Regulations)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2089/made) (external link) will come into force on 10 September 2012. Changes include:

  * **Presumption in favour of openness:** In the past councils could cite political advice as justification for closing a meeting to the public and press, or state that decisions being made were not 'key decisions'. The new regulations create a presumption that all meetings of the executive, its committees and subcommittees are to be held in public (regulation 3) unless a narrowly defined legal exception applies. A meeting will only be held in private if confidential information would be disclosed, or a resolution has been passed to exclude the public because exempt information is likely is be disclosed, or a lawful power is used to exclude the public in order to maintain orderly conduct at the meeting (regulation 4).

> - Confidential information is information provided to the council by a Government department upon terms which forbid disclosure to the public or information which statute or a court order prohibits from being disclosed to the public.
>
> - Exempt information is set out in Schedule 12A to the Local Government Act 1972 and it includes information about a person, or information that would reveal their identity, consultations or negotiations relating of labour relations, or information in connection with preventing and detecting crime.

  * **New legal rights for citizen reporters:** Local authorities are now obliged to provide reasonable facilities for members of the public to report the proceedings as well as accredited newspapers (regulation 4). This will make it easier for new 'social media' reporting of council executive meetings thereby opening proceedings up to internet bloggers, tweeting and hyperlocal news forums.
  * **Holding private meetings:** In the past council executives could hold meetings in private without giving public notice. Where a meeting is to be held in private, the executive or committee must provide 28 days notice during which the public may make representations about why the meeting should be held in public. Where the notice requirements for a private meeting and an agreement of the chairman of the relevant overview and scrutiny committee or chairman of the relevant local authority has been obtained, the decision-making body must publish a notice as soon as reasonably practicable explaining why the meeting is urgent and cannot be deferred (regulation 5).
  * **Less red tape for councils:** Removing internal bureaucracy introduced by the last Government about 'key decisions', quarterly reports and 'forward plans'. Instead, a document explaining the key decision to be made, the matter in respect of which a decision would be made, the documents to be considered before the decision is made, and the procedures for requesting details of those documents, has to be published (regulations 9).
  * **Special urgent decision:** Where it is impossible to meet the publication requirements before a key decision is made and an agreement has been obtained from the chairman of the relevant overview and scrutiny committee or the relevant local authority to make the key decision, the decision maker must publish a notice to explain the reasons why the making of the decision is urgent (regulation 11). Previously no notice was required.
  * **Stronger rights of individual councillors:** Where an executive has in its the possession a document that contains materials relating to a business to be discussed at a public meeting, members of the local authority have additional rights to inspect such a document at least five days before the meeting (regulation 16). Previously no timescale existed.
  * **Stronger rights for scrutiny members:** Where the executive decides not to release the whole or part of a document to a member of an overview and scrutiny committee as requested by a councillor, it must provide a written statement to explain the reasons for not releasing such document (regulation 17).
  * **Publication requirement:** Publication of any notice by a decision-making body or a proper officer; or any document in relation to a key decision or public meeting and background papers must be on the relevant local authority's website (regulations 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 21).

2. The Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 opened up meetings to the public, allowing members of the public and press to attend meetings of certain public bodies including councils. Margaret Thatcher was the backbench MP who championed this as a Private Members Bill.

3. [Part 5A of the Local Government Act of 1972](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/part/VA) (external link) applies to access to meetings and documents of the full council and committees of the councils. It states that 'duly accredited representatives of newspapers' should be afforded 'reasonable facilities' to attend council meetings 'for the purpose of reporting proceedings for those newspapers'. It also sets out that for those parts of council meetings that are open to the public, councils are prevented from ejecting members of the public unless they are guilty of disorderly conduct or other 'misbehaviour'.

Measures aimed at boosting professional investment in good quality, privately rented homes and to help meet the nation's housing demand are published today.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps welcomed the [report by Sir Adrian Montague](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/privaterentedhomesreview), saying it offered, ""a blueprint"" for encouraging more institutional investment into the sector.

The vast majority of private-rented homes in this country are managed by individual landlords.

But Sir Adrian's report highlights the ""real potential"" for investment in large-scale development of homes built specifically for private rent by professional organisations.

The report finds that a combination of recent tax changes and wider market conditions have cleared the way for this sector to grow.

Sir Adrian's report makes a series of recommendations to speed up the timescale for building the private-rented homes needed to meet existing and growing demand. These include:

  * That councils use flexibilities in the planning system to plan for and enable developments of privately rented homes where they can meet local need. This could include waiving affordable housing requirements on new developments of homes specifically for private rent, or reviewing stalled sites to see whether some of the new homes planned could be made available to rent rather than sell;
  * That a task force be set up to encourage and support build-to-let investment from the private sector, and to develop voluntary standards that future landlords would meet and tenants could expect;
  * That the Government look to provide a number of targeted incentives to encourage the development of Build-to-Let business models, which could include sharing development risk in the short-term to get spades in the ground and building started;
  * That the Government allocate some of the redundant, formerly used public sector land and buildings being released for housebuilding to build-to-let development, and publish data on how this is done; and
  * That the Government work with councils and the Greater London Authority to identify a number of sites where there is good demand for rental housing and make them available to developers on the grounds that a proportion of the homes built be let out to tenants

Today's report is the conclusion of Sir Adrian's review, which was commissioned as part of the Government's [Housing Strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011) in November. The Government will issue a formal response later this year.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We're determined to encourage greater investment in the build-to-let market and boost the country's Private Rented Sector, which plays an integral role in meeting the nation's housing needs and aspirations. In the past it's often been seen as the Cinderella of the housing market, but when over three million people rely on this sector for their home, this is clearly no longer the case.
>
> ""A major part of this is to attract and encourage new players to the market, while at the same time avoiding the excessive regulation that would force up rents and reduce choice for tenants.
>
> ""Sir Adrian Montague's findings offer both a blueprint for achieving this goal, and for setting the standards of accommodation that people should expect. I will be considering his recommendations very carefully.""

Sir Adrian Montague said:

> ""It's clear we must encourage investment in the private rented sector, which has gone through a period of rapid growth and is now relied upon by millions of people.
>
> ""My review shows that the rental housing sector offers potential investment opportunities of interest to institutional investors. But real momentum has been inhibited by constraints affecting the supply of stock, the treatment of rented housing schemes under the planning system and the need to create confidence among investors.
>
> ""The recommendations in today's report are designed to challenge this, and remove the barriers that prevent the kind of investment that our private rented sector needs.""

Following a tour of The Atlantic Worlds Gallery that recounts the personal histories of Toussaint l'Ouverture, Olaudah Equiano, Samuel Sharp and other leaders of resistance and rebellion, he joined in on a performance from Gospel singers Ethnovox, which explored the significance of song in the history of resistance against slavery. The Minister then joined a lecture given by historian Dr Hakim Adi on the transatlantic slave trade and African Resistance.

Race Equalities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The human suffering, caused by slavery and the slave trade are amongst the most dishonourable and abhorrent chapters in human history and it remains vital that we recognise the achievements of the abolition movement and ensure that the impact of the slave trade is not forgotten.
>
> ""It is a sad fact that, although slavery is outlawed internationally, millions of people are still living in conditions of slavery worldwide. Wherever, whenever and in whatever form slavery occurs, the Government unreservedly condemns it and is committed to eliminating it.""

UNESCO's General Conference in 1997 decided that 23 August should be designated ""International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition"". The night of 22 to 23 August 1791, in Santo Domingo (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) saw the beginning of the uprising that would play a crucial role in the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. UNESCO chose this date as a reminder that enslaved Africans were the main agents of their own liberation.

[New guidance](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/unauthorisedencampments) has been sent to all council leaders advising how to act swiftly. The advice sets out the strong powers councils and landowners have to remove illegal and unauthorised encampments, such as traveller sites, protest camps and squatter sites from both public and private land.

The guidance makes clear that councils should work with agencies, such as the police and Highways Agency, and make full use of the powers that can stop illegal camps ever starting.

Councils have seen a number of cases of people setting up unauthorised encampments at weekends, for example, and using that time to develop land illegally while council offices are closed.

Setting up camps during a weekend often means enforcement action needed to stop unauthorised camps and development - such as actions to stop the cutting down of protected trees or laying of concrete drives - is delayed or too late.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""I'm urging all councils to be on the front foot and ready to take action straightaway to stop illegal camps starting in the first place. This Government has strengthened councils' powers to take action, but I want councils to have the confidence to take decisive action. Too often councils and landowners feel powerless to stop unauthorised camps and development when in fact there are extensive powers to tackle this problem head on.""
>
> ""Unauthorised development is totally unacceptable at any time but can often be more upsetting for local established communities when it happens while council offices are closed and people feel there is no one available to help them.
>
> ""There is never justification for people bypassing the planning rules that everyone else has to abide by and this guidance makes crystal clear what powers there are to stop unauthorised development before bigger problems arise.""

Mr Pickles has urged councils to ensure planning officers are ready to take swift enforcement action and use the tough powers available to tackle rogue encampments. Powers that can be used include:

  * pre-emptive injunctions to protect vulnerable land from unauthorised encampments;
  * possession orders to remove trespassers from land;
  * police powers to order unauthorised campers to leave land;
  * temporary stop notices to stop work that breaches planning rules, allowing councils to decide whether further enforcement action is needed
  * powers of entry onto land so authorised officers can obtain information for enforcement purposes.
  * planning contravention notices to stop work on development if there appears to be a breach of planning rules or a council needs more information about the activities on the land;
  * enforcement notices to remedy a breach of planning rules;
  * ensuring sites have valid caravan or tent site licenses.

The Government is committed to protecting the nation's green spaces and this guidance will help protect Green Belt land and the countryside from illegal encampments.

The Government has already introduced new rights for travellers who play by the rules. These include stronger tenancy rights on authorised council sites, incentives through the New Homes Bonus scheme for councils to build more authorised sites, and the abolition of Whitehall Planning Circulars on travellers. It is spending £60million on helping local communities establish properly approved and planned sites and earlier this year published new planning policy on traveller sites.

A draft bill containing proposals for the future audit regime was published in July 2012. In the future, councils will be free to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market and there will be a new audit framework for local health bodies.

The full programme of reforms will bring in a more localist approach and is expected to save £650million in public money over the next five years.

The current Chairman's term of appointment will end on 30 September 2012. The new Chairman will lead the Commission to an effective and efficient closedown, and oversee the delivery of its reduced functions until the organisation is formally disbanded.

Coldplay, one of the world's best-selling music acts and stars of the London 2012 Paralympic Games Closing Ceremony, have endorsed bands and musicians across the UK to play the anthemic hit _Viva La Vida_ at 2pm, Sunday 9 September, the final day of the Paralympic Games, as part of the official finale event to the London 2012 Festival - Bandstand Marathon.

![Coldplay](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2205702.jpg)Coldplay anthem Viva La Vida will play out the last day of the Games at hundreds of bandstands across the UK

Bandstands nationwide, including the Olympic Park Bandstand, will see musicians of all kinds perform their own unique renditions of this epic song at the same time - a collective moment to mark the end of the London 2012 Games and a fantastic summer of sport and culture.

Coldplay's Chris Martin said:

> ""It's a great honour for us to be part of the celebrations for the Paralympic Games and it should be a great moment when the bandstands of Great Britain strike up in unison.""

This exciting preview to the Paralympic Games Closing Ceremony later in the evening is part of the nationwide Bandstand Marathon, an event that will see hundreds of outdoor community concerts taking place simultaneously throughout the UK from 1pm - 5pm.

From Inverness in the Scottish Highlands to Penzance on the tip of Cornwall, and from the historic town of Armagh, Northern Ireland to Llandudno on the Welsh coast, Bandstand Marathon will present a unique portrait of the UK's diverse musical tastes and styles in 2012.

Bandstand Marathon's oldest singer, at 91, will take to the stage in Bellfield Park, Inverness, whilst Regent's Park, London will celebrate traditional and contemporary Jewish music. Stourbridge will play host to a near 100-piece Ukulele band, whilst in Chester a sign-language choir will entertain the crowds. An Elvis impersonator will bring rock n' roll to Victoria Park, Barry, and visitors to Broomfield Park, Palmer's Green, London can expect the Afro-Caribbean beats of The Harambe Drummers.

Three acts have won the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to perform at the Olympic Park Bandstand:

  * the 130 year old **Abergavenny Borough Brass Band**;
  * London's **Dhol2Dhol** traditional Indian drum troupe; and
  * female Barbershop chorus **The Belles of Three Spires**.

The Last Bandstanding competition was judged by award-winning conductor Charles Hazlewood, who will also be participating in the Paralympic Games Closing Ceremony, together with Bellowhead member, Paul Sartin.

Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""The spectacular summer has shown off the strengths of our country in style and it hasn't ended yet. It continues with the Bandstand Marathon and everyone should come out to enjoy the musi cal events at their local bandstand.""

> ""2012 has been the year for all our communities to come together, from the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, the Olympic Torch Relay and of course the Games themselves, reinforcing our shared identity and celebrating our great country. We have seen how these big national events can have a positive impact on local communities, bringing people out into our parks and onto the streets in their thousands, bringing a sense of joy and championing all those things we share together rather than keep us apart.""

Ruth Mackenzie, Director, London 2012 Festival said:

> ""The Bandstand Marathon is encouraging local music groups to showcase their talents and be part of the London 2012 Festival. I am proud that we are delivering our vision to use the power of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games to boost participation in creating a cultural legacy post-London 2012.""

Katharine Lane, Associate Director, Superact said:

> ""London 2012 has been an incredible success and the UK public has played a huge part in this, embracing London 2012 and taking part in the wealth of fantastic events across the country in the run up to and throughout the Games. We're delighted to present Bandstand Marathon, the official finale event to the London 2012 Festival - bringing families, friends and communities together in a nationwide musical celebration of what has been an unforgettable summer.""

Bandstand Marathon is produced by not-for-profit arts organisation Superact and Making Music, the UK's number one organisation for voluntary music. Support from the Department for Communities and Local Government is enabling Bandstand Marathon to expand and enhance its existing annual programme, doubling the length of the local events to four hours this year, and providing opportunities for training, community networking and audience participation, and linking musicians together across the country.

Spending on council tax benefit has more than doubled since 1997. Figures revealled today show that since 2006 council tax benefit fraud and error has cost the taxpayer an estimated £1.1bn, an average of around £3m per council.

Welfare reform is an important part of the Government's strategy to repair the national deficit. Giving councils a stake in providing council tax support will assist local job creation, promote enterprise and reduce welfare dependency.

Government reforms will localise council tax support putting councils, who already raise and collect the tax, in charge of the discount. This will give councils a stronger incentive to support local firms, cut fraud, promote local enterprise, end the something for nothing culture and get people into work.

As part of that deficit reduction strategy councils will be expected to save over £400m a year when they begin running local council tax support schemes next year. Councils will keep all savings they can make from reducing fraud and error.

Between 1997 and 2010 council tax bills more than doubled. The Coalition Government has worked with councils to freeze council tax for two years, cutting council tax in real terms.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""It is not right that over a billion pounds of taxpayers' money has been lost through council tax benefit fraud and error when there are hard working families and genuinely vulnerable people out there who deserve help with their cost of living expenses.
>
> ""Today's figures show that when councils take over the benefit with their local schemes there is lots of money to claw back from wasteful mistakes and fraudsters cheating the system.
>
> ""Town halls are already the ones who set and collect council tax so it makes senses that they are the ones who give out the support too. Our reforms will restore the confidence of hard-working taxpayers that the benefits bill is under control and that work pays.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Local Government Finance Bill was introduced in December 2011 and paves the way for the implementation of localised council tax support schemes in England from April 2013. Royal Assent is expected later this year. The Bill will see council tax support determined by local authorities. This will give local authorities the flexibility to design schemes which reflect local priorities, giving them a greater financial stake in the economic future of their area and enabling them to deliver a saving of 10 per cent on the current council tax benefit expenditure bill.

2. Council tax bills were £1,439 on the average Band D property in England in 2010-11, an increase of 109 per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. The Coalition Government has worked with councils to freeze council tax for two years - cutting council tax in real terms.

3. Council tax benefit expenditure in England increased from £2.0 billion to £4.3 billion from 1997-98 to 2010-11 (DCLG, _Local Government Finance Bill: Localising support for council tax - Updated Impact Assessment_, p.5, [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/lgfblocalisingcounciltax](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/lgfblocalisingcounciltax)).

The Housing Minister has unveiled a new fund of £1.3m to help give more power to communities over their social homes. Grant Shapps hopes the scheme will help bring the passion of the Olympic volunteers and last year's broom armies to local communities by giving housing association and council tenants a voice to lead change in their area.

Mr Shapps said the [Tenant Empowerment Programme](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/socialhousing/tenantempowerment/) would offer a ""springboard for success"" to communities across the country who want to see their local needs reflected in the services they receive.

This could be by helping tenants learn the skills they need to engage and negotiate confidently with their landlords; forming tenant panels to come together to demand the best value-for-money services; or even to take control of local services themselves if they feel that they could deliver more for less.

The Minister also highlighted the benefits to landlords of getting their tenants involved, from community involvement in scrutinising new repairs contracts or tenants working together with local authorities to tackle anti-social behaviour.

### Giving tenants the confidence to invest in their community

The Minister invited charities and benevolent societies to submit their ideas for delivering a national programme that will:

  * encourage the creation of more tenant panels - groups of tenants who can challenge landlords, shape services and get involved in local decision making; and
  * help individual tenants engage with their landlords on a range of issues and services.

A new Community Cashback scheme will also be at the heart of the Tenant Empowerment Programme - allowing groups of tenants who choose to take on the management of services, such as maintenance and repairs, to reinvest any savings they make from running these services themselves into other community priorities.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""In the past 12 months we've seen the power of local people in action, from the 'broom army' clean-ups after the riots to the Olympic volunteers helping this country put on the greatest show on earth. I know that tenants in communities across the country have that same passion.
>
> ""This £1.3m programme will be a real springboard for local success, giving tenants real power, whether they choose to take local services over completely or merely challenge their landlords to do better.
>
> ""We're bringing communities together and giving them the knowledge, skills and confidence to build their own Big Society in their back yard. And by helping them to ensure their area's unique needs are being met I hope they will inspire more tenants across the country to lead change in their communities.""

### Notes to editors

1. Applications are being sought from charities, benevolent societies and philanthropic institutions, as defined by the Charities Act 2006, for grant funding to deliver a tenant empowerment programme to tenants living in social housing.
[www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/tenantempowermentprospectus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/tenantempowermentprospectus).

2. The tenant empowerment programme is designed to inspire tenants to lead change in their communities by having the skills and confidence to scrutinise, influence and control local services through tenant panels and other scrutiny mechanisms.

3. Grant funding of up to £1.32m will be made available from the £8m Tenant Empowerment Programme, announced in February 2011 to deliver two separate programmes. Applicants can choose to apply for one or both programmes.

4. This funding is intended to support activities over and above those that landlords should provide as part of their regular responsibilities.

Neighbourhood planning gives people a major say in shaping development in their area. It gives communities the power to help decide where development should go and the type and design of development that can be granted automatic planning permission.

A £10 million fund is now available to help councils ensure their communities are able to finalise people's plans for homes, businesses and facilities in their neighbourhood.

More than 200 communities are already using the new planning powers introduced in the Localism Act to work up plans that can, for example, decide the location of new homes and decide the green spaces communities are keen to protect.

Councils are today invited to apply for grants of up to £30,000 for each scheme to help pay for the costs of getting plans in place. Payments will be paid to councils to help them support and advise groups taking forward neighbourhood plans and to pay towards the examination of plans and a local referendum.

Greg Clark said:

> ""We have seen enormous enthusiasm from communities around England, jumping at the chance to be in the driving seat of deciding the future vision of their neighbourhood.
>
> ""This fund will give councils and community groups working on plans a big boost in getting their vision in place as soon as possible to ensure people can enjoy the benefits sooner rather then later.
>
> ""Neighbourhood planning is making sure local residents are, for the first time, centre stage in helping decide their neighbourhood's future. It is giving people the chance to plan positively and will help deliver the homes and jobs their communities need to thrive.""

### Eden Valley's plan a step closer

The Upper Eden Community Plan Group has their plan well underway after the enthusiasm of residents to be at the centre of decision making ensured they were one of the first areas to use these new powers.

The area covering 17 parishes in and around Kirkby Stephen in Cumbria has already been designated a neighbourhood plan area.

A plan that focuses on how and where to provide new housing, affordable housing for older people and better broadband connectivity has now been passed to the Eden District Council for a formal consultation. Local people and businesses will be invited to comment before a final referendum is held.

### Notes to editors

1. Payments will be made in two payments. The first, of £5,000 will be made once a neighbourhood area has been designated. The second payment of £25,000 will be made on successful completion of the neighbourhood planning independent examination.

Plans for thousands of new homes that have been stuck on the drawing board for a decade are to finally get the go-ahead thanks to an historic deal reached between ministers, councillors and developers.

The deal will unlock around 22,600 much-needed homes over the next 20 years - delivering as many as 60,000 jobs - and brings a brownfield site back into use. The first phase at Eastern Quarry, Ebbsfleet, in Kent will deliver 1,500 homes as part of wider plans for Kent Thameside.

Developers Land Securities have invested over £100million in developing the site. However, plans have been delayed amid concerns over the cost and the need for further investment in transport improvements.

But now, after work by Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Transport Minister Mike Penning with Kent councils and the developers, builders could be on site as early as next Summer with the first homes set to be completed by December 2013.

### Historic deal reached

Kent County Council and Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils worked closely with the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency to reduce costs of the transport programme and to agree how funding could be unlocked. Under the arrangements agreed, the Department for Transport and Highways Agency will begin development work on two major junction improvements and will work with Kent County Council and the Kent Thameside partners in managing the transport investment programme necessary to deliver the new developments.

Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils will ensure that contributions from Land Securities and other sites are provided to support the transport improvement programme, and that they and Kent County Council use a proportion of their New Homes Bonus payments to contribute to the programme.

The deal reached between these three councils and Land Securities on the specific planning obligations - known as a Section 106 agreement - will enable work to start. Land Securities will contribute nearly £25million towards the Homes and Roads Programme, through to completion of 4,500 homes on the site by 2020.

Mr Shapps said that this illustrated the benefits of Government, local authorities and developers working together to unlock progress on stalled larger sites and signalled that he was keen to build on this approach in the future.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's frustrating that while the need for homes in Kent and the surrounding area has continued to grow, the Kent Thameside development - offering the opportunity for tens of thousands of new homes - has been stuck on the drawing board for a whole decade.
>
> ""So I'm delighted that we're finally taking steps forward to get builders on site and work finally started. This historic deal offers a double benefit to the local area, a commitment to improve the road network but also to deliver over 22,600 properties over the next 20 years - with the first homes set to be completed in little over a year from now.
>
> ""After such a delay, like local residents I look forward to seeing the properties being built, the jobs being created and, in the near future, the first families moving into their new homes.""

Transport Minister Mike Penning said:

> ""The Government has been clear about the need to maintain a pipeline of future transport infrastructure improvements given their importance in delivering economic growth.
>
> ""By agreeing to carry out the necessary preparatory work for potential future junction improvements on the A2, we have been able to show our commitment and give the confidence needed by private sector developers to allow them to begin the delivery of the ambitious new housing programme in Kent Thameside.""

Paul Carter, Leader of Kent County Council said:

> ""Getting this significant development underway and built out signals our continued intent to increase construction activity in Kent. We have real growth ambitions and this site signifies our intent to unlock the potential of the Thames Gateway. Where sites are stalled we will talk to developers about ways of releasing sites in the short term. However we will only work with those that are intent on accelerating development.""

Councillor Jeremy Kite, Leader of Dartford Borough Council said:

> ""It has been a long road but this finally seems to be our opportunity to build a great community and top quality housing for a new generation of Dartford families. Housing for sons and daughters of local people is a real responsibility and Eastern Quarry provides a great setting for young people to build their lives.""

Colette O'Shea, Head of London Development, Land Securities said:

> ""We are pleased that a way forward has been found to unlock the potential at Eastern Quarry and we will now sit down with our housebuilding partners and press ahead to start delivering homes and jobs.""

### Notes to editors

1. The first phase of 1,500 homes at Eastern Quarry are expected to be completed by 2020, with a further 3,000 homes expected to be completed by 2030-31. Eastern Quarry forms part of longer term plans which are expected to unlock the development of 22,600 homes and around 1million m2 of commercial development across the Kent Thameside region over the next 20 years.

2. The Homes and Communities Agency has already invested £13million in the supporting transport investment (the Homes and Roads Programme), and is committed to working with all parties to identify other future funding sources as work progresses on the development.

3. The Kent Thameside Strategic Transport (Homes and Roads) Programme is a £116million investment in transport improvements covering both the Strategic and Local Road Network aim at enabling the planned level of development to be realised.

MPs returning to Parliament next week can put their towns first by putting their local high streets forward for a package of Government support and help make them the beating hearts of their communities once again, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said today.

![High Street Illustration (Dermott Flynn)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2082239.jpg)Illustration by Dermott Flynn

The Minister urged MPs whose towns missed out in the Portas Pilot competition to apply now for their town centres to become [Town Team partners](http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/economicgrowth/highstreetsportas/townteampartners/) and benefit from help available, including support from the Government and access to advice and support from leading retail experts.

He also called on towns across the country to apply to be considered for the [Future High Street X-Fund](http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/economicgrowth/highstreetsportas/x-fund/). Those town centres that show they have made the greatest improvements will win a share of the £1million prize on offer.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Having witnessed the overwhelming response from over 400 towns to our search for Portas Pilots, I'm determined that the energy and enthusiasm they displayed is not lost, and that every area has the opportunity to breathe new life into their high streets.
>
> ""It's time to put 'Our Towns First'. That's why today I'm calling on MPs to apply for their towns to become Town Team partners, so that communities can put their plans into action with the backing of retail experts as well as learning the lessons from other town teams from across the country.
>
> ""And for those who make the greatest improvements to their high streets, I look forward to awarding them with a share of the £1million Future High Streets X-Fund so that they can continue their sterling work to bring their town centres back to life.""

### No high street left behind

This package of support comes after an overwhelming response to the competition to find 27 Portas Pilots. With over 400 town teams submitting bids, Mr Shapps is clear that none will be left behind in the campaign to breathe new life into the nation's high streets.

Those MPs that apply to be Town Team partners will be making a commitment for their town team to take forward key elements of their original plan for reviving their high streets.

In exchange, they will have access to:

  * an advice line and a network of advisers managed by the Association of Town Centre Management, as well as key informative events;
  * direct mentoring and visits from a range of retail experts;
  * regular meetings with other Town Teams to share lessons learned, tips and ideas; and
  * an online community to receive advice and information from retail experts; and
  * benefit from a Government-sponsored fund designed to help towards getting their plans off the ground

Already Portas Pilots across the country are taking steps to bring their high streets back to life. These include:

  * Market Rasen's Portas Pilot, who attracted 35 new traders to the town in July putting the 'market' back into Market Rasen and enticing thousands of new visitors into the town. Going forward, they are now looking to run their next BIG Market event on 1 September with the theme, 'Say Goodbye to Summer';
  * Stockton's Portas Pilot, who are already achieving their goal to connect local businesses to the range of events taking place in the local high street. For example, for the 25th anniversary of Stockton's International Riverside Festival, local restaurants were offered their own gazebos, banners and leaflets to serve their food to visitors.
  * Dartford's Portas Pilot, which has opened a community shop to be used by a range of community groups as a place to meet and socialise. The Pilot have also been generating more Sunday trading through a 'My Sunday' marketing campaign that promotes the towns businesses, market, parks and free parking.

### Future High Street X-Fund open for business

Mr Shapps also called for nominations for town centres to be considered for the £1million Future High Street X-Fund.

This prize will be shared among the high streets that show the greatest improvements. Towns will be judged by an independent expert panel, for the inventiveness of their schemes and the impacts they can evidence, such as increased footfall or turnover, or improved skills and employment levels.

Towns will also need to explain how they plan to use their prize money to further support their high streets.

Ministers today launched a major clampdown on rogue landlords to bring an end to suburban shanty towns that trap vulnerable people in dangerous living conditions.

![Beds in sheds](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2208223.jpg)Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Immigration Minister Damian Green outside a shed being rented out illegally

Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Immigration Minister Damian Green launched new guidance to councils making clear the wide range of powers at their disposal to shut down so-called 'beds in sheds' that blight entire neighbourhoods and take action against other bad practice by landlords such as overcrowding and poor maintenance.

Mr Shapps and Mr Green saw the evidence for themselves when they attended an early morning visit on a suspected rogue landlord's properties, and witnessed the squalid conditions the 'tenants' paid hundreds of pounds a week to live in.

While visiting six properties, officials from Ealing Council and the UK Border Agency encountered 39 individual tenants, 22 of whom were illegal immigrants:

  * of those 22 illegal immigrants encountered, **19 were detained** (three were required to report to a Reporting Centre because they were a couple with a young child);
  * of those 22 encountered, **14 were found in the outhouses** (this includes the two adults with the young child). The remainder were found in the houses;
  * of those 19 detainees, 16 were Indian nationals and three were Pakistani nationals;
  * of those 19 detainees, nine entered the country without leave, eight were overstayers, one was a failed asylum seeker and one was working in breach of his visa conditions.

### Power to tackle rogue landlords

The new guidance highlights the range of actions councils can take to clamp down on rogue landlords once and for all. These include:

  * proactively identifying problem properties and effectively working through complaints;
  * taking action using a full range of legal powers to stop rogue landlord activities;
  * working with other organisations including the police and UK Border Agency to tackle linked criminal behaviour;
  * prosecuting landlords who persistently let illegal property;
  * providing evidence of landlord's earnings to magistrates to ensure they receive an appropriate level of fine for offences;
  * naming and shaming prosecuted landlords by publicising successful cases;
  * working with the new national taskforce which has been set up between Whitehall departments, the police, the UK Border Agency and local government. The taskforce is exploring all possible options for closing down 'beds in sheds'.

Thousands of sheds and outbuildings are being rented out illegally to vulnerable migrants by ruthless landlords who charge them extortionate rents to live in cramped conditions.

These 'tenants' can often find it difficult to return home quickly with some having destroyed their passports to avoid removal often leaving them to either live in these outbuildings or face living on the streets.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's simply unacceptable that people are living in squalid, unsafe accommodation provided by landlords more interested in a quick profit rather then their basic responsibilities.
>
> ""The actions of these rogue landlords are helping fuel illegal working and benefit fraud and creates a shadow housing market that carries dangers to peoples health as well as community relations.
>
> ""I want to see all agencies from councils to the police and the UK Border Agency using the full range of powers at their disposal to work together on a national clampdown towards ridding our communities of this problem once and for all.""

Immigration Minister Damian Green said:

> ""Operations like this show our determination to do whatever is necessary, working alongside local authorities and police, to enforce our laws against those who are in the UK illegally.
>
> ""The UK Border Agency continues to gather intelligence about those illegally in the country. Those with no right to be in the UK must leave the country. If they need help to leave the country voluntarily we will offer it but if they refuse we will enforce there removal.""

Today's guidance is backed up by the recent allocation of £1.8million to councils earlier this year to tackle the issue and flush out those landlords renting out 'beds in sheds'.

New planning rights will allow more flats to be created above shops without the need for planning permission. Two flats will be allowed to be created in office or storage space under new permitted development rights coming into force.

The change further streamlines the planning system, making it easier, quicker and cheaper for people to create new homes in existing underused space. It has the potential to help increase the amount of affordable housing and ensures better use is made of existing developed land.

Relaxing planning restrictions on creating flats above shops can also help increase the vitality of town centres by increasing footfall and providing a boost to high street regeneration.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""These are common sense planning reforms that will deliver more affordable homes in areas where there are good transport links whilst ensuring better use of existing developed land.
>
> ""Cutting this red tape should be a shot in the arm for the high street increasing footfall and providing a boost to regeneration.""

Planning Minister Greg Clark Mr Clark said:

> ""The Government is determined to make the very best use of existing buildings to provide more homes as quickly and simply as possible. This change offers real potential to provide more affordable housing and give a much needed boost to our high streets.

> ""Ensuring unused space above shops can be used in a better way is one of the many changes the Government has introduced to streamline the planning system and to cut unnecessary bureaucracy.""

The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.

It has also announced proposed measures to simplify the planning system further by making it easier to temporarily re-use some buildings without needing planning permission, streamlining the paper work needed for planning applications and speeding up planning appeal decisions.

The Government has also outlined a package of measures to help high streets reclaim their role at the heart of our communities. These include encouraging town centres to become Town Team partners to benefit from the support and advice available from the Government and leading retail experts.

### Notes to editors

1. The change in permitted development rights applies to A1 (retail units) and A2 (financial/professional services units) commercial properties.

2. Current legislation only allows for one flat to be created above a shop without the need for a planning application.

Funding to help those facing the real and frightening prospect of homelessness will continue to the end of this Parliament, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

![StreetLink poster](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2208882.jpg)A preview of the new StreetLink poster

Councils across the country are set to receive a share of £160million over the next two years.

The Minister also confirmed that a new website and telephone line, where anyone anywhere looking to get help for someone sleeping on the streets can go to, is on track to be available by Christmas.

He also offered a first-look at a new campaign aimed at encouraging people to seek help for rough sleepers in their area.

### Funding support

Mr Shapps announced that councils across the country would receive £160million over the next two years in Homelessness Prevention Grants - offering certainty that homelessness services will be funded to the end of this Parliament.

This is on top of the £160million that has been allocated to councils over this and last year, which has been used to offer support to those facing the threat of homelessness, including:

  * providing rent deposit schemes to enable homeless people to get accommodation in the private rented sector
  * mediation services to help prevent relationship breakdown leading to homelessness
  * outreach services to help get rough sleepers off the streets and into accommodation.

Latest figures show that 199,000 households were last year given help to stay in their homes or find new places to live - stopping them from facing losing their home and, potentially, a life on the streets.

### StreetLink support

Today, Mr Shapps also confirmed that plans for a new website and national phone line are on track to be available by Christmas, so that anyone will be able to ring if they are looking for help for someone sleeping rough.

StreetLink, to be run by charities Homeless Link and Broadway, will include a national telephone line, and website accessible via smart phone, so anyone anywhere can provide details of someone sleeping rough in their neighbourhood so they can be found and connected to local services.

A series of posters will be released in December alongside these new tools, so residents, charities and councils can all work together to ensure as few people as possible face spending this Christmas on the streets.

The Minister released the first images from a campaign due to start in the run-up to Christmas to encourage members of the public to come forward and seek help for local rough sleepers.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""All too often, we see people sleeping rough on our streets and don't know what to do for the best, where to turn to get them help and whether offering a handout really does offer them help out of homelessness.
>
> ""That's why I'm delighted that this December, StreetLink will offer a solution, with members of the public able to ring a national helpline or use a website accessible by smart phone to help ensure someone sleeping rough can be found and connected to local services.
>
> ""And to ensure that we shore up the strongest safety net in the world, I can today confirm £160m funding right up to the end of this Parliament, giving councils the means to continue their strong work in preventing homelessness in the first place.""

  * up to 70,000 new homes, including affordable housing and opportunities for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder
  * 140,000 jobs and a boost to the construction sector
  * £40 billion guarantee for major infrastructure projects and £10 billion for new homes.

This includes a series of measures aimed at supporting businesses, developers and first-time buyers, while slashing unnecessary red tape across the planning system.

The measures include:

  * Removing restrictions on house builders to help unlock 75,000 homes currently stalled due to sites being commercially unviable. Developers who can prove that council's costly affordable housing requirements make the project unviable will see them removed.
  * New legislation for Government guarantees of up to £40 billion worth of major infrastructure projects and up to £10 billion of new homes. The Infrastructure (Financial Assistance) Bill will include guaranteeing the debt of Housing Associations and private sector developers.
  * Up to 15,000 affordable homes and bring 5,000 empty homes back into use using new capital funding of £300m and the infrastructure guarantee
  * An additional 5,000 homes built for rent at market rates in line with proposals outlined in Sir Adrian Montague's report to Government on boosting the private rented sector
  * Thousands of big commercial and residential applications to be directed to a major infrastructure fast track and where councils are poor at processing decisions developers can opt to have their decision taken by the Planning Inspectorate. More applications also will go into a fast track appeal process.
  * 16,500 first-time buyers helped with a £280m extension of the successful 'FirstBuy' scheme, which offers aspiring homeowners a much-needed deposit and a crucial first step on the housing ladder.
  * For a time limited period, slashing planning red tape, including sweeping away the rules and bureaucracy that prevent families and businesses from making improvements to their properties, helping tens of thousands of home owners and companies.

The Prime Minister said:

> ""The measures announced today show this Government is serious about rolling its sleeves up and doing it all it can to kick-start the economy. Some of the proposals are controversial; others have been a long time in coming. But along with our Housing Strategy, they provide a comprehensive plan to unleash one of the biggest homebuilding programmes this country has seen in a generation. That means more investment around the county; more jobs for our people; and more young families able to realise their dreams and get on the housing ladder.""

The Deputy Prime Minister said:

> ""This is a Coalition Government, determined to get on with the job of delivering a healthier economy.Today's major boost to housing and planning will make it easier to build a home, easier to buy a first home and easier to extend a home. A boost that will get Britain building again. Building thousands of affordable homes and generating thousands of new jobs.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Today we are announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building, speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.

It welcomed the Committee's acknowledgement that this Government has done a good job of managing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in England, including, in particular, the transfer of programme administration from the Regional Development Agencies to the Department for Communities and Local Government.

Although welcoming most of the findings in the report, the Government does not agree with the Committee's view that the transfer led to delays in approving projects and that there was a lack of match funding which affected their development.

The Minister responsible for the European Regional Development Fund in England, Baroness Hanham said:

> ""I welcome the Committee's acknowledgement of the improvements this Government has made to the management and delivery of English European Regional Development Fund programmes, by transferring responsibilities for their management to the Department.
>
> ""However, I do not believe that this led to delays in the approval of projects. All English programmes met their 2011 spend targets, which is an indication that projects were being approved and processed on time.
>
> ""With regard to the issue of the availability of match funding - at present, some 98 per cent of the 2007-13 English European Regional Development Funding allocation is either contracted or waiting to be contracted, which means that there is match funding in place. Therefore the need for part of the Regional Growth Fund to be ring fenced for ERDF purposes is not at present necessary""

### Background

The Communities and Local Government Select Committee held an inquiry into the European Regional Development Fund earlier this year. The Government submitted written evidence to the Committee in April and Baroness Hanham subsequently gave oral evidence to the Committee on 9 May.

The Committee published its final report on 13 July. The main areas the Committee investigated were the impact and value for money of ERDF; the role of DCLG in programme management and the provision of match funding; and improvements for the future, 2014-20 programme period.

The key conclusions in the report are that:

  * ERDF is a highly valuable source of funding for local authorities and other recipients;
  * the transfer of ERDF management from the Regional Development Agencies to DCLG went well, but there were delays in project approvals and the emphasis on compliance with the EU Regulations has led to more innovative bids being rejected;
  * there is a lack of match funding for ERDF projects, so part of the Regional Growth Fund budget should be set aside to provide match funding;
  * many of the EC's proposals for the 2014-20 programmes are welcome, notably the possibility that Local Enterprise Partnerships could take a greater role in managing ERDF; and
  * beyond 2020 the Committee would like to see repatriation of the Funds backed with a HM Treasury guarantee that there will be no loss of funding for the poorest regions.

The aim of ERDF is to reduce the economic disparities between and within Member States, by supporting economic regeneration and creating jobs. DCLG is the Managing Authority for ERDF programmes in England. It oversees 10 Operational Programmes with a total value of €3.2 billion (around £2.8 billion) in the 2007-13 programming period.

Until July 2011, the Regional Development Agencies carried out the day to day management of ERDF programmes in England. Following the decision to abolish the Regional Development Agencies, DCLG took over responsibility, whilst retaining a locally based ERDF Programme Delivery Team in each Operational Programme area.

ERDF generally pays up to 50 per cent of the eligible costs of a project. The remaining match funding must be found by the applicant and can come from a range of public and private sources, including Government funds such as the Growing Places Fund, Broadband UK and the Regional Growth Fund.

In October 2011, the European Commission published the draft Structural Funds Regulations to cover the next, 2014-20, programming period. The Regulations are currently the subject of negotiations between the European Commission and Nation-States.",11-Sep-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr Pickles met council officials, Citizens Advice Bureau staff and local Nepali community leaders and discovered how Rushmoor Borough Council are spending £500,000 that he had given to help with integration of former soldiers and their families.

![Eric Pickles meets Gurkhas at Rushmoor](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2216606.jpg)Eric Pickles meeting Gurkhas and their families

The funding has helped ease the exceptional pressures on Rushmoor, which has seen a large number of Gurkha ex-servicemen and their dependents arrive in the towns of Aldershot and Farnborough over a relatively short period of time. The recent arrivals include a high proportion of children and elderly Nepalese nationals which has placed a recognised strain on local social, health and education services.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""These brave British army veterans have given our country loyal service over many years. It is their bravery that has helped protect our way of life and our traditions and it is right that their dedication is honoured.
>
> ""Many of these ex-servicemen and their families have been proud to call this country their home and we too are proud of the strong ties that have been established between the ex-Gurkhas, their families and their wider communities. We are determined that if they chose to settle in the UK to see that they and their families are treated with dignity and respect and are made to feel welcome.""

Mr Pickles also used the visit to announce the final instalment of the funding, a £150,000 payment towards English language training which is seen as a vital element in helping the Nepali people settle and contribute to their local community.

In his first speech as Housing Minister, Mr Prisk urged housing associations to turn their expertise in providing social homes to also building new homes for private rent.

He called on landlords to bid for a share of a £10billion Government Guarantee and ""provide the spark to get Britain building"", delivering homes built for new tenants - whether in social homes or for private rent.

### ""Tremendous opportunity""

A review of the private rented sector by Sir Adrian Montague highlighted real potential for the development of homes built specifically for private rent, with funding for these new properties coming from institutional investors.

But speaking to the National Housing Federation in Birmingham, Mr Prisk argued that social landlords could also make the most of the potential that Sir Adrian's report identified.

The Minister pointed to Thames Valley Housing Association's ""Fizzy Living"" scheme, which offers newly-built flats for rent on the open market in London's East End, and urged more landlords to ""take that leap of faith"".

He argued that with years of experience and expertise in providing affordable homes to rent and buy, housing associations could both continue delivering services for social tenants and offer homes for private tenants.

Last week the Government brought forward a range of positive measures to get Britain building. Mr Prisk will point out that landlords could be using these to make the most of this potential market.

The measures include:

  * New legislation for Government guarantees of up to £10billion for new rented homes; and
  * £300million capital funding towards delivering up to 15,000 new affordable homes and bringing 5,000 empty homes back into use

Mark Prisk said:

> ""There's a tremendous opportunity here. We know there is already a massive demand for housing in the private rented sector. Housing associations already provide excellent services to their tenants, but have the potential to offer homes to a much wider group of people.
>
> ""By making the most of the new and positive measures we're taking, social landlords can branch out and provide the spark to get Britain building.""

Local Enterprise Partnerships will be invited to bid for matched funding for 2013/14 and 2014/15, setting out how they would be able to offer a cash match from public or private resources. Details on the scope of the match will be discussed with Local Enterprise Partnerships shortly.

The Government made £5million of core funding available to Local Enterprise Partnerships last year to help them start up and establish themselves through financial support for things such as board support, development of priorities and business engagement. This was followed by a further £4million to build capacity over a four year period.

### National Housing Federation annual conference 2012

* * *

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

#### Introduction - working together

Thank you for that introduction.

Tonight I should like to speak briefly and specifically about how we can increase the supply of homes.

I do so, in one sense as the most dangerous type of Ministers (my civil servants will take that view!), namely someone who has a little knowledge of what he is talking about!

As a Chartered Surveyor, I feel I have some understanding of the housing and the construction markets. But I come to this role knowing that frankly I still have much to learn, particularly about the social housing sector.

So let me start by saying that I want to listen. The expertise when I look gathered here around the room is one I intend not to ignore. Indeed it's experience which I value. There will be times when we won't always agree, but if we work together, we can make a real difference.

#### Government's role

As a Government we are already setting the direction.

Last November, we established the Housing Strategy as our long term framework for future action.

In the Spring, we introduced a series of key policies, including for example New Buy, which has the capability of helping up to 100,000 people.

And just two weeks ago, a day after I was in post, we set out a comprehensive set of measures to accelerate progress. Those measures include:

  * Building up to another 15,000 new affordable homes and bringing an extra 5,000 empty homes back into use;
  * Putting an additional £280 million into FirstBuy - so around 27,000 will now be able to buy their first home; and
  * Confirming Government Guarantees of up to £10 billion, for the development of many more new rented homes.

Now, these guarantees in particular have the potential to galvanise the sector. And it shows that, despite inheriting an enormous deficit, this Government is absolutely committed to providing the policies and resources needed to build the homes people want.

These new measures build on the £1.3 billion that is already working to unlock stalled housing schemes, and the Affordable Homes Programme of £19.5 billion, which we are confident, will deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes.

Taken together with our reforms to the planning system and the rented sectors, these policies represent the best way to improve our housing provision in both the short and longer term.

#### Challenge

But, tonight, if I may, I would also like to issue a challenge.

I said earlier that I value your collected expertise and capability. Many of the organisations represented here provide a wide range of innovative social housing, and good services to existing tenants.   But I think you can do more.

There's a great opportunity to use your experience to develop more homes and serving a much wider group of people.

Housing associations are after all good at tailoring services that respect very different housing needs. Affordable home ownership is a good example.

I've seen the work of London and Quadrant on the former Olympic Park where they are already developing affordable homes for both rent and purchase.

And just last week Thames Valley launched their Fizzy Living scheme to prospective private tenants.

So what I'd like to challenge you all to think about is how you can develop homes for a much wider group of people, in different ways, and perhaps in different tenures.

We will help, not least through our newly announced housing guarantees; and the £200 million equity finance fund, so take it from me that we want you to be bold.

#### Clarity and stability for sector

As a former businessman I do, however, understand that for you to be innovative, you need longer term certainty about the market you work in and the direction of government policy.

This is especially true when it comes to the future of finance for affordable homes and the specific direction of policy on rents and policy reaching beyond the current spending review period.

Now on this, my ninth working day in the job, I can't set out for you the full detail for the next three years. But let me be clear:

  * I understand why you need that certainty;
  * I intend to address this longer term framework;
  * I want to do so working with you and others so we get it right.

#### True value of social housing

As a former Business Minister, I also know about the economic value of your sector: the ability to drive local growth.

Most people understand the social role of housing, whether owned, or rented, whether private or public.

And I strongly believe that housing is not merely about bricks and mortar. All of us need a home, somewhere we can call our own, somewhere that families can be secure and where children can grow.

And I shall want to address those social issues, whether it is the scourge of neighbours from hell, or the plight of the homeless.

However, increasing the housing supply, especially of affordable homes, also has an important economic purpose. One in which you and the organisations you represent have a vital role.

Building affordable homes, when you look at the bare statistics, is a great economic multiplier - and your buying power can help sustain local businesses.

You also provide jobs and help tackle worklessness. Thousands of young people have benefited from apprenticeships with construction companies on affordable housing projects.

And let me also to say to you that it doesn't matter how small your organisation is.  Indeed many of the smaller organisations are at the cutting edge of community activism, successfully using the new community rights that this Government has introduced.

It's about giving local people a say as to what goes on in their community - whether that's deciding where new homes are built, or how affordable housing is managed, this role is really important.

So, while the issue of building new affordable homes is clearly front and centre - I also want to say that I recognise the vital role you play in helping to protect the homeless, the vulnerable and the marginalised in society.

#### Conclusion

So, Ladies and Gentlemen, we're putting in place a comprehensive set of measures to help this sector adapt and grow.

Of course, there are significant challenges, but as a Government we are determined to work with you to address both the short term symptoms and the long term causes.

That's why we're:

  * Providing our multi billion pound guarantees to help lever in new investment;
  * Removing the planning and financial barriers that are holding back the housing market; and
  * Developing a clear direction to help increase the supply of all forms of housing, owned or rented, public or private.

I think the package really has the opportunity to make a real difference and I am looking forward to working with you.

Overcoming the problems before us won't be easy.  But then, nothing worthwhile ever is.

Thank you.",17-Sep-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/ministers/986547.jpg,mark-prisk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Department for Communities and Local Government on Tuesday brought co-ordinators from all 152 upper-tier local authorities in England to London for a major national conference on delivering the Prime Minister's pledge to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families in the next three years.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2219460.jpg)Louise Casey and Eric Pickles speaking to troubled families co-ordinators

Hosted by head of the troubled families programme Louise Casey, the conference looked at ways of working with some of the hardest to reach families in the country in order to reduce youth crime and anti-social behaviour, get children off the streets and into school; and put adults on a path back to work.

And Secretary of State Eric Pickles told the co-ordinators that David Cameron ""is obsessed by this issue"":

> ""What I'm keen on - where you have small numbers of families ruining areas and estates - is not just saving money but saving people - these are lives unfulfilled. You coordinators are going to do challenging work. You will be my revolutionaries! You will be looking at problems of the household as a whole, not as individuals.
>
> ""Across the political spectrum there is angst and guilt at not having dealt with this before. But where it is really working we are already seeing results. But I'm in a hurry. And that's because we need momentum. So that we can show the sceptics that there is another way.""

Funded by DCLG, co-ordinators will oversee each upper-tier authority's troubled families programme and targets, bringing local agencies such as health, housing, social services, education and the police together on the ground in order to tackle problems in a joined-up way.

In her keynote speech to the conference, Louise Casey called on co-ordinators to be assertive, authoritative and challenging, and argued that the fate of the programme was in their hands:

> ""I've given quite a lot of speeches since I took this job in December, but I have to say that this is the most important speech, to the most important audience so far. That is because I've made a huge commitment - to turn around the lives of 120,000 families - and you are the people who will determine whether that commitment is fulfilled and ultimately whether the troubled families programme succeeds or fails. This is a job that, for all of us, is not for the faint hearted.
>
> ""As troubled families co-ordinators you will be at the forefront of this push to bring about real change in families' lives - the ambition being that their children will be going to school, they won't be committing crime and anti-social behaviour and they will no longer be costing vast amounts of money in everything from noise complaints to police call outs and care proceedings.
>
> ""We can all see that something needs to give and we need to do things differently. We have to reduce the vast amounts we are spending right across public services on these families. Something has to give in terms of changing these families' lives, but something also has to give if we're going to reduce the resources these families absorb from your purse.""

### Local statistics

* * *

I would like to update Hon. Members on changes to the publication of the Department's statistics.

Today my Department has announced its response to the consultation on proposed changes to the Department's statistics. From October this year, we will no longer publish statistics at a government office regional level. Instead the Department will plan to publish, where appropriate, statistics for Local Enterprise Partnerships and upper-tier local authorities, complementing existing statistics by local authority.

The Coalition Government has abolished regional government. The unelected Regional Assemblies/Regional Chambers, the Government Offices for the Regions, the Regional FiReControl programme, the Regional Development Agencies have been terminated, as is intended for the Regional Spatial Strategies, subject to the strategic environment assessment process outlined in my statement of 3 September 2012, _Official Report, Column 5WS_.

The government office regions were an inefficient tier of administration based on arbitrary boundaries. They did not reflect the areas that local residents most identified with, nor were they areas with common economic problems and market conditions, nor were they the most sensible boundaries for coordinating functions such as fire and resilience.

The continuing use of the former government office regional boundaries no longer provides a coherent framework for assessing public policy. Many of the Government's policies now use alternative local geographies, for example Local Enterprise Partnerships, the New Homes Bonus and City Deals. Publishing statistics at a regional level is no longer necessary or informative, and we see little point in producing statistics at taxpayers' expense for their own sake.

The old regional classifications are also misleading - they fail to quantify both the pockets of deprivation that can exist within regions or the differences between rural and urban England, and there is an inconsistency of approach to the size and population of each government region. They are arbitrary lines on a map that have no resonance - in contrast to England's long-standing cities, boroughs and counties which have a real sense of local identity and popular support, dating back centuries in many cases. England has no history of regional government, whereas it does have a great tradition of local governance that this Government wishes to strengthen.

There is also a European dimension to the regions in the form of Eurostat's Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics standard (the appropriately named 'NUTS Regulations'). It is the view of Ministers that the NUTS1 hierarchy is no longer appropriate for Structural Funds in England moving forward from 2014. Ministers reject the notion of a 'Europe of the Regions' where nation-states and national Parliaments are sidelined, and replaced with distant regional governments answerable only to a federal European super-state. Dismantling such arbitrary, unelected regional administrative structures will assist in that goal.

Ministers have carefully considered all the representations made in the consultation. I would note that, for the purposes of historic comparisons, nothing prevents academics and other interested parties from compiling and analysing the open local authority data by the old regional government boundaries, if they wish.

The consultation response also notes the implementation of a new form on local authority housing statistics which reduces and rationalises the data we are asking local authorities to provide, reducing burdens on local government. It also reports on the responses on Land Use Change Statistics which confirmed their importance for monitoring the outcomes of planning policy.",18-Sep-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/ministers/1575629.jpg,"Image: Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Archbishop, who is President of the Bishops' Conference of England and Wales discussed with Baroness Warsi the central role faith plays within communities and in building a cohesive society.

Baroness Warsi is also Senior Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where her responsibilities include human rights and religious freedom, and is holding a series of meetings with faith leaders during her first few weeks in post.

She said:

> ""Ever since I have been in Government I have been making the case for faith and I am delighted to be taking on a dual role in which I can focus on continuing to do so. I will be working closely with religious leaders, and communities of different faiths and none, and I was delighted to see Archbishop Nichols to discuss the opportunities and challenges ahead - particularly on issues of faith and religious freedom.""

The Archbishop of Westminster said:

> ""I welcome the government's renewed emphasis on the vital role faith plays in community life and in building a cohesive society. Baroness Warsi has demonstrated strong leadership in promoting good relationships with Religions both domestically and internationally. I look forward to working with her to build on this important work.""

They discussed building upon the achievements of February's visit to the Vatican, during which Baroness Warsi led the UK's largest ever ministerial delegation to the Holy See alongside the Archbishop of Westminster.

145,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2217967,New chairman appointed to close down the Audit Commission,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"Jeremy Newman will be the new Chairman of the Audit Commission in the lead up to its abolition, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

From the start of next month Mr Newman will take over the role of leading the Commission to an effective and efficient closedown, and overseeing the delivery of its reduced functions in the run up to closure. He succeeds the current Chairman, Michael O'Higgins. His appointment follows a formal recruitment process and approval from the Communities and Local Government Select Committee following a pre-appointment hearing.

The full programme of reforms to local audit and inspection, and the closure of the Commission, will bring in a more localist approach and are expected to save £650million in public money over the next five years.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""I am pleased to announce the appointment of Jeremy Newman as new Chairman of the Audit Commission. Jeremy brings significant knowledge of audit and a proven track record of delivery, which will be essential as he oversees the Commission's closure and the smooth transfer to the new local audit regime.""

The Government announced its intention to close the Audit Commission in August 2010. The Commission's work on Comprehensive Area Assessment and routine inspections has already ceased, and the work of its in-house audit practice outsourced to the private sector. A draft bill containing proposals for the future audit regime was published in July 2012. In the future, councils will be free to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market and there will be a new audit framework for local health bodies.

### Notes to editors

1. Jeremy Newman is a chartered accountant by profession and the former Chief Executive (2008-2011) of BDO International and prior to that was managing partner (2001-2008) of BDO's UK firm. Following his appearance at a pre-appointment hearing, the Communities and Local Government Select Committee confirmed him as a suitable candidate for post. They were ""impressed with the breadth of his experience within the financial audit sector and his enthusiasm for helping to deliver a new framework for local government audit"".

2. The Chairman is appointed by the Secretary of State under the Audit Commission Act 1998 part 1, 1 (3). He will be paid £30,000 a year and serve for six days a month. This is a significant reduction on the previous Chair's pay of £90,487.

3. Appointments to the Audit Commission are regulated by the Office for the Commissioner of Public Appointments. The Department for Communities and Local Government advertised for a Chairman throughout June 2012 and interviewed on 26 July 2012. The selection process followed the process set out in the code issued by the Office for the Commissioner of Public Appointments. The code can be found at: [http://publicappointmentscommissioner.independent.gov.uk/the-code-of-practice](http://publicappointmentscommissioner.independent.gov.uk/the-code-of-practice/) (external link).

4. DCLG published a draft bill on 6 July 2012 and is currently consulting on the proposed new audit framework for local public bodies, the process for the appointment of auditors, and the regulatory framework for local public audit.

140,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2219250,Spirit of the summer realised with relaxation of flag flying rules,bringing-people-together-in-strong-united-communities,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced a liberalisation to the regime for flying flags, giving a boost to patriotic pride, after a Summer of success that has seen national and community spirit flying at an all-time high.

![Armed Forces flag](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2167200.jpg)The Armed Forces Day flag can now be flown without express consent

A wider range of flags will now be able to be flown without seeking express consent meaning individuals, businesses and community groups will now be able fly their chosen flag with pride without incurring costs of up to £335.

The changes will increase the number of flags that people can fly, promoting integration and community spirit.

Flags that could be displayed without express consent include:

  * A wider range of national, sub-national, community and international flags
  * The Armed Forces Day flag and a wider range of military flags

An expanded range of flags that will have deemed consent will also include:

  * The rainbow 'Pride' flag
  * Flags of sports clubs
  * Award scheme flags

There is also to be a relaxation in the number, size and siting of flags in all areas away from sensitive sites such as national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty. This common sense safeguard is to ensure that controls are maintained where they are needed.

Secretary of State Eric Pickles said:

> ""The widespread flag flying during the Royal Wedding, Diamond Jubilee and Olympics is evidence of a gradual cultural change in Britain. The British people are increasingly proud to fly flags as an expression of their local and national identities. Flags unite communities across colour, creed and class, so I am cutting municipal red tape to make it easier to fly Britain's varied and diverse flags without state interference.
>
> ""Flags represent our sense of self, of the communities we belong to, our interests and beliefs and our pride in being British. I've been celebrating this sense of patriotic pride by flying a range of flags outside my Department in recent months and look forward to seeing more flying around the country with the relaxation of these rules.""

Andrew Rosindell MP Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Flags said:

> ""For centuries flags have been used to display and promote the identity of nations, communities and organisations. I am delighted that British people will now be encouraged to hoist a banner and continue this tradition without restriction. I commend the Department for Communities and Local Government for taking the lead on this initiative and look forward to seeing a tapestry of flags flying across the nation!""

Charles Ashburner, Chief Executive of the Flag Institute said:

> ""Flags are important to all UK societies and social groups. They are emotive symbols of unity, sport, protest, and patriotism. In our super fast world of instant news and ever changing technology flags remain the ultimate symbol of identity. I therefore welcome Mr Pickles' changes as the most significant shake-up of flag regulations in a generation.
>
> ""We were delighted when Mr Pickles first launched this project in a heartfelt speech at the Flag Institute's 2011 Spring Meeting. Today's launch realises those hopes and takes an important step towards encouraging and protecting the huge variety of different community and individual identities of which British society should be so proud.
>
> ""The deregulation of flag flying regulations is something which everyone who believes in freedom of expression should support. This really is a new Freedom to Fly Flags.""

### Notes to editors

1. For planning purposes, flags are treated as a form of advertising and their display is regulated by the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007 ('the Regulations').

2. A flag for which no planning consent is required can be flown without reference to the local planning authority, subject to a number of conditions and limitations. Flags with deemed consent can also be flown without applying for consent but are subject to specific conditions and limitations, and can be subject to discontinuance action by the local planning authority if their display gives rise to substantial detriment to the amenity of the area.

3. These measures affect only the planning controls which regulate flag flying. Where relevant, those wishing to fly certain flags would still need the permission of their authorised user prior to their display (eg flags of HM Armed Forces). Obtaining such permission is not a planning matter and therefore cannot be stated within the Regulations.

4. The relaxation of regulations comes into force on 12 October.",20-Sep-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2167200.jpg,Armed Forces flag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Community Right to Bid, created in the historic Localism Act, comes in force tomorrow across the country so communities can 'stop-the clock' on the sale of valuable local assets and amenities like post offices, village shops or community pubs, giving them time to put in a takeover bid of their own and protect it for the wider community's benefit.

Speaking to audience of local activists and parish councillors at the National Association of Local Councils conference, Mr Foster spoke of the Government's continued desire to push power back into the hands of local people so they can decide what is important in their communities for themselves.

The new right gives voluntary and community organisations and parish councils the opportunity to nominate an asset to be included on a list of 'assets of community value', pausing the sale of a successfully listed asset for six-months, giving communities the time to prepare a bid and get a business plan together. Previously the community had no opportunity or time to gather resources to bid to buy or take them over.

Communities Minister Don Foster said:

> ""For too long communities have been shut out, forced to watch from the sidelines as treasured local assets, vital in peoples daily lives, have been shut-down and sold on. We are determined to put an end to that and put people back at the centre of the future of their communities.
>
> ""The Community Right to bid lets communities decide what's important to them and 'stop the clock' on sales so they have them the time to get together a bid, put together a plan and ensure that prized local assets can live on, this time run by the local community for the local community.""

Communities are already showing their determination and appetite to get involved in saving and running local facilities and amenities and over 500 people are looking into using the Right to Bid in their community.

  * In Norden, local people formed a Trust to buy and refurbish the historic old library building and reopen it as a community facility. The group purchased the lease form the Local authority and since then the building has been transformed into a modern community hub and a doctors surgery.
  * In Cranleigh, the community is already planning to use the Community Right to Bid to return the first village hospital in the community back into the hands of the local people to provide support to the elderly in the community and ensure that the long history of the building as a community facility can continue.

The Community Right to Bid, is just one of the Community Rights measures brought in by the Localism Act. In June, the Government announced a £30million package of specialist support to help communities take advantage of their new rights.

### Notes to editors

1. The Community Right to Bid was introduced by the Localism Act 2011 which was enacted on 15 November 2011. The Right to Bid comes into force on 19 September.

Mr Foster hailed the growth of the nation's farmers' markets in recent years but said more can be done to support both high streets and the agricultural economy.

As the Harvest festival approaches he pledged to make it a priority in his new role to build on the success of the Government's Love Your Local Market campaign and back British products.

Mr Foster was speaking on a visit to Brighton farmers market during the 'Organic September' month organised by the National Farmers Retail and Markets Association and ahead of their annual conference in Harrogate.

Encouraging the public to buy British produce from their local Farmers Market will not only benefit the country's farmers but will also help regenerate high streets and town squares as they see an increase in footfall to surrounding shops and restaurants.

The Government has been driving the regeneration and growth of the nation's high streets through Portas Pilots, Enterprise Zones and by keeping business rates low for small business owners.

Markets Minister Don Foster said:

> ""In my own town of Bath we are proud to have had the country's first Farmers Market and their success continues to literally bring home the bacon for British Farmers and their produce. Markets are a British institution - the familiar cry of 'pound for a pound' echoing across town squares.
>
> ""The Harvest festivals will be in full swing in the coming weeks and I'm encouraging the public to visit the nearest market this weekend and 'Buy British' - they'll be impressed by the great value and great taste of the produce on offer.""

128,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2225005,Councils seeing benefits of reducing numbers of empty homes,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,don-foster,,"Bringing thousands of empty homes back into use has unlocked over £63million additional funding that is directly benefiting local communities through the successful New Homes Bonus scheme, Communities Minister Don Foster revealed today.

In a further move towards greater Government transparency, the figures showed which councils have made the biggest reduction in empty homes and the New Homes Bonus that they will have received for doing so.

In total, local authorities have brought nearly 38,000 long-term empty homes back into use over the past two years - helping to tackle the housing shortage and providing a roof over the heads of hard working families across the country.

The top five local authorities that have seen the biggest reduction in empty homes are:

  * Birmingham, which has brought 2,151 empty homes back into use, along with
  * Manchester, 2,118 homes
  * Bradford, 1,944 homes
  * Liverpool, 1,855 homes, and
  * Salford, 1,582 homes.

On the release of the figures, Don Foster said:

> ""This information, shown in this way for the first time, lets people see how their councils are embracing the New Homes Bonus by examining their empty housing stock and turning it back into use.
>
> ""I'm delighted we've had such a positive start and encourage all councils to work hard in transforming empty properties, which drag down neighbourhoods, and instead turn them into homes fit for families.
>
> ""By making councils accountable to their residents, not to Whitehall, we are ensuring local tax-payers have the ability to check that money is being spent efficiently and decisions taken for the benefit of the communities they serve.""

The Government's powerful and innovative New Homes Bonus scheme rewards councils who increase their housing stock, either by building new homes or converting empty properties back into use, by match funding the additional council tax raised, with an additional amount for affordable homes, for the following six years.

This has meant that communities are seeing the benefits of growth for the first time - in stark contrast to the previous, top-down system of regional housing targets which Ministers argue pitted neighbourhoods against developers.

The Minister said that the funding, to be allocated to 41 councils over the next two years - would bring over 86,000 homes up to a decent living standard.

And with reports in some areas that every pound spent on Decent Homes improvements creates £1.46 in local spend through orders to tradesmen and suppliers in the area, he said the cash would also help kickstart the economy, supporting local tradesmen and creating new jobs.

Today's investment secures the future until the end of this Parliament of the Decent Homes Programme, confirming the indicative allocations made in 2011. The cash will help councils bring their homes up to a decent standard, from fitting new roofs and windows to updating kitchens or heating systems.

Mr Prisk said that this new construction and skilled work would provide a shot in the arm for thousands of local businesses and tradesmen, supporting the Government's measures to boost British jobs and the economy.

He is also keen to explore bringing forward some of this funding to councils to help boost their economies through local investment in decent homes. Officials will shortly be in touch with councils to see what may be done to achieve this.

The Minister said that spending money earlier would help boost local employment as early as possible, as well as delivering home improvements for tenants ahead of schedule.

Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:

> ""By improving this country's council homes we will transform many families' lives for the better, bringing their living standards up to scratch ensuring that their home is the safe haven it is meant to be.
>
> ""But the benefits of the £1billion I've confirmed today reach far beyond tenants themselves and into the local economy. With every pound spent on improvements boosting local business, creating new jobs and supporting local spending, I want to see councils realising the benefits of this cash as soon as possible.""

Since its designation as a new town in 1967 Milton Keynes has been subject to central Government involvement either through the establishment of Development Corporations or, more recently, through the Milton Keynes Partnership Committee.

But under new plans published for consultation today, those planning functions currently undertaken by the Homes and Communities Agency would be transferred to Milton Keynes Council. This would allow Milton Keynes Council the opportunity to plan development more strategically in their area and also allow local residents a greater say in how that land is developed.

Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:

> ""For years, development control of Milton Keynes has been split between the locally elected council and a Government agency. Today's proposals would shift power back to where it belongs - with the people who live in the area.
>
> ""I look forward to hearing how Milton Keynes Council plans to work with local people to decide the future development of their town to secure its future for years to come.""

Homes and Communities Agency Chief Executive Pat Ritchie said:

> ""The Homes and Communities Agency has been working closely with colleagues at the Department for Communities and Local Government and Milton Keynes Council for many months to facilitate this transfer which has now taken a significant step forward.
>
> ""It is a great example of central and local government working together to help achieve and deliver local ambition. We will continue to work together to finalise the process which will enable Milton Keynes Council to fulfil their plans for growth and continue the excellent development work that has been carried out here.""

Milton Keynes Chief Executive David Hill said:

> ""The 'localisation' of the Homes and Communities Agency's roles and responsibilities in Milton Keynes and the transfer of its residual land assets to Milton Keynes Council will - for the first time in Milton Keynes' history - mean that all the key mechanisms for shaping the way in which the city develops are in the hands of locally elected representatives.

> ""That should give confidence to local residents that plans for future growth will be responsive to their views and aspirations. The transfer package has been supported by all the political groups on the council.""

Visiting the St Werburghs Centre, the Minister was given a glimpse of community spirit in action, meeting the local residents who rely on the centre on a daily basis for services as well as a meeting place that welcomes the whole community. The centre is home to over 180 member groups and five tenant organisations who are working with the local community.

The visit comes two weeks after the Community Right to Bid came into force, giving communities the opportunity to 'stop-the clock' on the sale of valuable local assets and amenities like post offices, village shops or community pubs, giving them time to put in a takeover bid of their own and protect it for the wider community's benefit.

The new Right gives voluntary and community organisations and parish councils the opportunity to nominate an asset to be included on a list of 'assets of community value', pausing the sale of a successfully listed asset for six-months.

Communities Minister Don Foster said:

> ""Communities know their local areas best and that is why we are pushing power back to neighbourhoods.

> ""The St Werburghs centre is a great example of community spirit in action and testament of the determination and appetite of the local community to improve the places where they live and shape their future.

""The Community Right to Bid creates even more opportunities for people to step up and step in to save the facilities and buildings that are important to them, giving them the time to 'stop the clock' on sales so they have the time to get together a bid and ensure that prized local assets can live on, this time run by the local community for the local community""

![The iron bridge over Ironbridge Gorge](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2229505.jpg)Ironbridge Gorge is home to the world's first ever cast iron bridge

Described by writer Charles Hulbert in1837 as ""the most extraordinary district in the world"", Ironbridge Gorge in Telford and Wrekin, regarded as the birthplace of the industrial revolution and a symbol of Great British ingenuity, is under threat from landslides and slippage which could damage and even destroy the historic site and tourist industry it supports.

Funding will go to restoring and protecting Ironbridge Gorge so that generations to come can enjoy the landscape and an area that sparked a new age of modernity in Britain and across the world.

The site, which is home to the first ever cast iron bridge, sits alongside such marvels of the world as the Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China and the Egyptian Pyramids, on list of world heritage sites and plays an important role in the local economy. Each year the Ironbridge Gorge draws in over half a million tourists from near and far to the area and pumps £20million into the economies of Telford and Wrekin and the wider Shropshire area.

Constantly shifting river banks and the weight of stone in the abutments squeeze the Bridge, cracking ironwork and buckling the deck. The first reports of cracking in the Bridge were made as early as 1784, and repair and maintenance has become a necessary and regular ever since.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The picturesque 18th century Ironbridge Gorge stands as a monument to modernity and the industrial revolution - a testament to British ingenuity and ambition that has been universally protected as a World Heritage Site for all to marvel at. This summer we have seen just how much there is to be proud of in Great Britain so it is vital that we do not let places like Ironbridge Gorge deteriorate or slide out of sight.
>
> ""Today I can announce that the Government is stepping in with a £12million keystone investment that will preserve Ironbridge Gorge's place in history as one of the world's great symbols and a site of outstanding beauty for generations to come, making certain it can continue to draw in visitors and bring money into the local economy.""

### Notes to editors

1. Communities and Local Government will pay a total of £2.2million during 2012-14 for the stabilisation of Ironbridge Gorge. The Government has made a commitment to provide a further fund of up to £9.8million in 2014-15 subject to approvals.

2. In 1986, the Ironbridge Gorge became one of the first group of seven UK sites to be awarded World Heritage status by UNESCO. The designation of the Ironbridge Gorge as a World Heritage Site recognised the area's unique contribution to the birth of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, the impact of which was felt across the world. It was the achievements of pioneering industrialists including Abraham Darby, William Reynolds and John Wilkinson that led to the Ironbridge Gorge becoming by the close of the 18th century the most technologically advanced area in the world.

3. The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention was ratified by the UK in 1984. The Convention provides for the identification, protection, conservation and presentation of cultural and natural sites of 'outstanding universal value'.

4. The UK currently has 28 World Heritage Sites.

5 There are now nearly 800 World Heritage Sites worldwide and these are added to each year when the World Heritage Committee meets to consider new nominations.

6. Once a site is inscribed on the World Heritage List, a responsibility is placed upon the community and country within which it is located to care for and protect the Site on behalf of the wider global community and future generations.",4-Oct-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2229505.jpg,The iron bridge over Ironbridge Gorge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Community shares let local people to take a more active in role in their communities by giving members - as part-owners - a direct say in their success, encouraging them to play an active part in their future. Most investors buy shares to help achieve a social good, however if the enterprise is successful they may also benefit from dividend payments.

Dividends can be paid in money, but also in kind, with cheaper energy, cut-price pints, and local, fairly-priced food as possible incentives.

Backed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and run by Co-operatives UK and Locality - the country's largest network of community led organisations - the new Community Shares Unit will enable more local enterprises to use share offers as a way of raising finance - in particular risk capital - to purchase buildings or get new projects up and running.

Speaking at the Community Development Finance Association annual conference, Don Foster said:

> ""We are shifting control away from Whitehall, handing communities the powers they need to run their own affairs.
>
> ""Across the country, communities are showing they have the ambition and determination to secure ownership of important local assets and get new projects off the ground.
>
> ""We want to create the conditions in which social investment and community finance can flourish to make this happen. This new unit will give them the helping hand they need to take full advantage of the opportunity to do things their way, in the best interests of their area.""

The new unit aims to grow the community shares market with the ambition of launching over 200 share issues over the next three years. It will also offer guidance and advice to investors seeking to understand more about the market, and support community enterprises, with services such as checking offer documents.

Ed Mayo, Secretary General of Co-operatives UK, said:

> ""We're seeing more and more communities taking things into their own hands. They are investing co-operatively in local enterprises themselves, whether that's football or farming, retail or renewables.""

Hugh Rolo, Director of Innovation at Locality, added:

> ""We are delighted that the Department for Communities and Local Government is supporting one of the fastest growing areas of social investment. Community shares generate the right kind of finance and act as a powerful lever to access other funding, allowing communities to develop fully sustainable enterprises.""

### Notes to Editors

1. Since 2009, 15,000 people have invested in over 100 community share issues, raising over £15million. To find out more on community shares and the new Unit visit [www.communityshares.org.uk](http://www.communityshares.org.uk/) (external link).

2. Over the last three years Co-operatives UK and Locality have undertaken a Government-funded research project examining the potential of community shares and bonds as a way to increase community empowerment and grow social enterprises and attract investment from non-government sources. It investigated how members of the public can invest in enterprises that serve a community purpose. Ten projects tested the idea, looking at barriers that could restrict their growth and how they can be overcome. These include community retail stores, renewable energy and a football club. The outcome of the action research project confirmed that community shares not only help communities access funding directly but are also a good lever for accessing complementary grant and loan funding. They provide a viable option to the undercapitalisation of the community sector. The Department are funding Co-operatives UK in association with Locality, over three years, to establish the Community Shares Unit.

3. Community share offers are proving a lifeline for communities across the country. For example, Community enterprise organisation Bath and West Community Energy have, since 2010, raised funding to bring alternative sources of energy to their community, including the installation of solar, photovoltaic, hydro and wind technologies. With nearly 200 members, Bath and West Community Energy have raised £722,000 through a community share offer, exceeding their share target.  This in turn has helped them to secure £1million loan finance to fund 12 of their projects.

Mr Pickles was visiting the West Midlands Fire Service funded Safeside education facility in Birmingham city-centre, one of the first programmes to launch following the announcement earlier this year of £10m Government funding to Youth United. Youth United was established by The Prince of Wales and is a coalition of the major youth volunteering organisations from the Army Cadets to the Scouts to train thousands of volunteer leaders for national youth groups.

The event was part of a St John Ambulance 'Stick It' one-day training event, led by young people, teaching life-saving first aid skills to other young people.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Young people should never be able to say they are stuck for something to do. And it's great to know that many more thousands of young people will soon have the opportunity to join one of our great uniformed services.
>
> ""So whether it's Guiding, the police or St John Ambulance, all of them give young people opportunities to have fun and make new friends while at the same time develop their interests and skills, building self-confidence and a sense of adventure.
>
> ""Our uniformed services also provide a tremendous opportunity to volunteer. During the Olympic and Paralympic Games those thousands of volunteers from across the country offered a warm welcome, ensured that the Games went without a hitch and were a terrific example to us all. We must ensure this Olympic spirit of volunteering doesn't end along with the Games. Volunteering is a great opportunity to develop leadership skills and get involved in your local communities.""

Throughout the year, Youth United has been identifying specific areas where traditionally there have been limited youth opportunities and where existing volunteers need additional support.

New cadet units are now being established in fire stations, police stations and other existing public buildings and within two years over 10,000 more young people are set to benefit from the setting up of around 400 permanent self-sustaining new branches across the country staffed by 2,700 new adult volunteers.

Abi Collier (16) from Birmingham said:

> ""The thing is most people think being in a youth group is boring. Well I can tell you it's not - being a Scout has given me the chance to travel to try out new activities like zorbing, meet new people do something constructive with my life for my local community. It feels good to do something worthwhile.""

Rod Jarman, the Chair of Youth United said:

> ""Youth United is a network of voluntary organisations who have a proven track record of supporting young people develop into adults. These are independent organisations led by volunteers for young people. They have structured programmes to develop leadership and communication skills and provide young people with something meaningful, exciting and fun to do; whether that is gliding, sailing, creative or competitive activities.
>
> ""Through the funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government we are able to support growth of provision in some of the areas of highest need, provide young people who may not have had these opportunities before the chance to do something different and give another generation the benefit of being part of something positive and worthwhile.
>
> ""We are going to use the funding to support a step change of growth in the areas of greatest deprivation and lowest provision. To make this work we need to find more resources for local groups and more volunteers to help run them.""

Wendy Human, Head of Youth from St John Ambulance said:

> ""Uniformed organisations such as St John Ambulance are constantly reinventing themselves to better meet the needs of society. The DCLG funding means that we're able to help more young people learn first aid so they can save lives, through recruiting more youth leaders and reaching hard to reach groups.
>
> ""One of the schemes we're investing in is our RISE project which targets 16-25 year olds not in education, employment or training (NEETs).""

Vij Randeniya, Chief Fire Officer for West Midlands Fire Service said:

> ""We were delighted that the Secretary of State saw some of the vital work that goes on with young people - not only at Safeside, but throughout the West Midlands region.
>
> ""Our service works with tens of thousands of young people every year - many of them disadvantaged or troubled - delivering fire prevention and home, street and transport safety initiatives. The Young Firefighters' Association programme lets young people learn firefighter skills, boosting their confidence and improving fitness.
>
> ""These programmes achieve so much more than making young people safer. They enhance their skills, job prospects and attitudes, reduce anti-social behaviour, and encourage many to take part in volunteering and mentoring work.""

Huge enthusiasm has been shown for the scheme - with all 152 upper-tier local authorities in England on board - and momentum is now building, with families beginning to be identified and worked with, staff appointed and services expanded in order to get children back into school, reduce youth crime and anti-social behaviour and put adults on a path back to work.

Mr Pickles today confirmed that over 40,000 claims have been made for up-front 'attachment fees' worth over £100million as part of the groundbreaking payment-by-results programme. This means that - working with local authorities and other agencies - the Department for Communities and Local Government remains on schedule to meet the Prime Minister's pledge to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families by 2015.

The Local Government Secretary said:

> ""I'm delighted that this programme is progressing so quickly as it is crucial to turning around the lives of families that have been untouched by the State for a generation or more and turning around communities that are blighted by the problems these families cause.
>
> ""Up-front 'attachment fees' allow local services to be expanded and transformed in order to provide the joined-up and challenging approach we know is needed with these families, so it is good news that the Government has already paid out over £100million to allow this work to begin.
>
> ""However under our payment-by-results programme full payment will not be made unless and until our goals of reducing truancy, youth crime, anti-social behaviour and unemployment have been achieved, as well as reducing the costs these families cause to the taxpayer.""

Under the deal with local authorities, Government will pay councils up to £4,000 per eligible family if they reduce truancy, youth crime and anti-social behaviour or put parents back into work. The Government's £448million three-year budget is drawn from across seven departments in a bid to join up local services dealing with these families on the frontline.

### Notes to editors

1. This Press Notice applies to England.

2. Local authorities have committed to start work with 41,835 families across England by the end of this financial year, over a third of the 120,000 the Prime Minister wants to see turned around by the end of this parliament.

3. The Department for Communities and Local Government has paid out £111,577,600 in the first round of payment-by-results attachment fees, which will allow local authorities to move quickly to reorganise services and start working with families.

4. Full details of the Troubled Families payment-by-results framework can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/troubledfamiliesframework](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/troubledfamiliesframework).

5. As part of the framework all upper-tier authorities have agreed the number of families they will work with over the three years of the programme and in claiming attachment fees have now committed to the number they will begin work with in the current financial year. This represents a large increase in the scale of activity being undertaken and most of the work is expected to commence in the latter part of the year to allow for the necessary expansion of services.",8-Oct-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2232092,Third year of Council Tax freeze announced,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,eric-pickles,,"The Chancellor of the Exchequer has today announced new support for local authorities in England to help them freeze council tax for a further year and assist in keeping those bills down.

The Government will set aside an extra £450 million to help freeze council tax bills in England. The support for local authorities means that taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £72 on a five per cent rise in council tax.

Over the last two years the Government has provided grants of around £2billion to help freeze council tax. A freeze in council tax in 2013-14 would represent a real terms cut of around two per cent and a fall of nine per cent in real terms over the past three years.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Coalition Government's council tax freeze has cut council tax in real terms over the last two years. A third-year's freeze will mean the combined effect is potentially worth over £200 to Band D residents. Freezing bills again will really help hard working families and those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners with their cost of living.""

The £450million will be made available, through a new grant scheme, to local authorities who decide to freeze or reduce their council tax next year. If they do, councils, police and fire authorities will stand to receive £225million of funding in both financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15, equivalent to raising their 2012-13 council tax by one per cent.

In addition, in 2013-14 the Government will propose to lower the local authority tax referendum threshold to two per cent. This would mean if a local authority seeks to raise its relevant basic amount of council tax by more than two per cent, local people would have the right to keep council tax bills down through a binding referendum veto. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will formally set out the detail on this in December.

### Notes for Editors

1. A freeze in council tax this year will save families £72 compared to a five per cent rise, on top of the savings already made in 2011-12 and 2012-13. A freeze in 2013-14 represents a real terms cut of around two per cent, compared to latest inflation forecasts.

2. The Department for Communities and Local Government will shortly write to all English local authorities with full details of the scheme, including providing an indicative breakdown of estimated grants to help local authorities with budget planning.

3. The detail on the tax referendum thresholds will be formally set out by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government alongside the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement in December. The House of Commons will be asked to endorse the threshold levels before councils set their annual budgets in the spring.

4. The council tax freeze offer will apply separately to each billing and major precepting authority in England (rather than to each council tax bill issued). Billing authorities include shire districts, metropolitan districts, London Boroughs and unitary authorities and major precepting authorities include county councils, fire and rescue authorities, police authorities and the Greater London Authority.

5. If an authority sets its basic amount of council tax (i.e. its Band D council tax) in 2013-14 at a level which is no more than its basic amount of council tax in 2012-13, it will receive a grant equivalent to a one per cent increase on the 2012-13 figure in both financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15. Police, Crime Commissioners and fire authorities will also receive a grant equivalent to one per cent of their 2012-13 basic amount of council tax.

6. An unringfenced grant in support of the scheme will be paid to each eligible billing and major precepting authority based on the formula. Payments to authorities will be made through the grant-making powers in section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003.

7. Local authorities who wish to reduce their council tax in absolute cash terms are still also eligible to receive the grant. Local authorities who choose to increase their council tax will not be eligible for the grant scheme.

8. Since the Spending Review we have made available £1975million of funding to local authorities to freeze their council tax in 2011-12 and again in 2012-13. In 2011-12 every local authority in England took up the scheme, and council tax in England was frozen. In 2012-13 Government offered to help local authorities in England freeze their council tax again and 85 per cent of local authorities accepted. This limited increases in council tax across England to 0.3 per cent, the lowest increase since council tax was introduced.

9. Average Band D council tax and percentage change between 1993-94 and 2012-13 are shown below:

The proposals would allow councils greater freedom to choose when to use 'Temporary Stop Notices' in relation to caravans which are used as main residences and are in breach of planning control. This would be backed up with the potential for heavy fines.

Temporary Stop Notices enable councils to take immediate action against unauthorised development without having to wait three days for a Stop Notice, or 28 for an Enforcement Notice to come into effect (by which time it becomes costly and much more difficult to enforce against).

Under the current system councils are constrained as to when they can use these powers against caravans which are main residences. A small minority have sought to abuse the planning system, and the Government believes that this proposal will assist local councils in taking effective action. It is the Government's view that local councils are best placed to judge whether to use a Temporary Stop Notice in relation to caravans, and should not be constrained by blanket rules.

Subject to the outcome of consultation, the proposals would remove restrictions on the use of Temporary Stop Notices and help councils to act immediately and safeguard their local area from the emergence of unauthorised sites.

This would provide a strong deterrent, and any person guilty of this offence is liable to a fine of up to £20,000, which can be increased to an unlimited fine, on conviction on indictment in the Crown Court.",10-Oct-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Minister announced the first allocations from a £280million pot to help a further 16,500 first time buyers benefit from the FirstBuy scheme.

Mr Prisk confirmed that £40million will go to 41 developers to help 2,500 first-time buyers this year - and called on them to go further, and bid for a share of £240million to help deliver thousands more new homes under the scheme next year.

### Home ownership hope for thousands

The hugely popular FirstBuy scheme reduces the amount of deposit first-time buyers have to find by offering an equity loan of up to 20 per cent provided by the Government and developers.

The Minister said that the extension of FirstBuy would provide help to thousands more first time buyers across the country, offering an alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad.

The scheme has already helped thousands of buyers across the country, with 3,000 sales made by March this year and developers reporting more than 8,000 FirstBuy reservations by the end of August.

The £280million boost to FirstBuy forms part of the Housing and Growth Package announced by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in September, one of a range of measures designed to get Britain building and kickstart the economy.

This package builds on the suite of options available for aspiring homeowners who want to get onto and up the housing ladder. This includes the NewBuy Guarantee and the reinvigorated Right to Buy, which will give thousands of council tenants the opportunity to buy their home.

Mark Prisk said:

> ""Firstbuy has already proved hugely successful, providing a practical alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad for thousands of first-time buyers across the country.
>
> ""The scheme has become a major player in helping people onto the property ladder and getting Britain building again - and I'm determined to maintain that momentum.
>
> ""That's why today just a month after the Prime Minister confirmed this funding boost, I'm asking developers to start putting this money to good use - and giving them the chance to start planning for how they can help first-time buyers in the coming year.""

Homes and Communities Agency chief executive Pat Ritchie said:

> ""We welcome the additional £280million of FirstBuy funding, which will make a major difference to the lives of prospective homebuyers and keep momentum for affordable home ownership going, not only for this financial year but for the year after.
>
> ""We are pleased to be able to allocate some of the funding for this financial year, and anticipate a strong bid response to the remaining £240million, and we look forward to working with our developer partners to bring these homes forward.""

### Notes to editors

1. FirstBuy provides first time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20 per cent of a new build property from a participating developer. The loan, which is jointly funded by Government and housebuilder, can reduce the deposit requirement to just 5 per cent.

2. In Budget 2011 the Chancellor announced the FirstBuy scheme which will see Government and housebuilders providing £400million to help around 10,500 first time buyers purchase a home.

3. The Homes and Communities Agency published official statistics on 12 June that showed there had been 2,994 sales by the end of March 2012 (sales starting in September 2011).

4. On 6 September the Prime Minister announced a further £280million for the scheme.

Pupils and teachers from every maintained secondary school in England will have the chance to go on a tour of the great battlefields - such as the Somme, Verdun and Fromelles - and take part in remembrance ceremonies on the western front.

World War I is already compulsory for children aged 11 to 14. This project - part of the Centenary Education Programme - will allow pupils to learn at first hand about the sacrifices made by the troops and the personal stories of those involved in the war effort.

Children who do not visit will also benefit when pupils and teachers who have taken part in the project pass on what they have learnt from their first-hand experience. This could involve establishing commemoration projects, like collecting photographs and uncovering local stories, in their schools and local communities.

Prime Minister David Cameron made the announcement today as he set out the Government's plans to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War in 2014.

Speaking at the Imperial War Museum, an institution founded in 1917 to record the then still-continuing conflict, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to build a truly national commemoration, worthy of this historic centenary.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Wilfred Owen described World War I as the 'winter of the world'. The sacrifices of our forefathers are our shared heritage and the centenary will be commemorated across the nation and around the globe. We will remember them. It is vital that we help educate the next generation about this important part of our history so that it is never forgotten and I am delighted that my Department is helping this to happen.""

Education Secretary Michael Gove said:

> ""The men who gave their lives in the Great War will remain heroes forever. The last British Veteran has now died but their bravery and suffering must never be forgotten.
>
> ""This project will ensure that never happens by leaving a lasting legacy of this hugely significant period of our nation's history and culture.
>
> ""Children will learn, at first hand, about the sacrifices made by individuals and communities to secure our nation and protect our liberty. This tangible experience will reinforce what they have learnt in the classroom.""

Pat Barker, author of the _Regeneration_ trilogy of novels and a member of the centenary project advisory panel, said:

> ""I have found it an incredibly moving and enlightening experience, especially the monument at Thiepval in Flanders and seeing the names of men who have no graves. I am sure that all children who go on these tours will benefit hugely.""

Hew Strachan, Chichele Professor of the History of War at Oxford University, said:

> ""As with the Olympics, so with the centenary of the Great War: the commemoration must bequeath to future generations a legacy that equips them with a deeper understanding of the war, its many meanings and its truly global significance.""

The project will cost £5.3m, from 2013 to 2019. Half the money is coming from the Department for Education and half from the Department for Communities and Local Government.

A procurement process will be run to decide on a single tour operator before the visits start in spring 2014, running until spring 2019.

As part of the Department for Education's £15m investment in cultural education following the Henley Review, we are working with cultural education organisations, including Arts Council England and English Heritage, to develop proposals for schools to mark the commemoration.

A successful and established scheme helping West Midlands businesses boost their innovation and research and development activities is set to continue for another three years after receiving a huge funding boost.

Innovation Networks Phase 2 seeks to raise the levels of innovation amongst West Midlands small and medium sized businesses by providing grants to groups of companies that can work together and collaborate on the development of innovative new products, processes or services.

The second phase of this important project is supported by just under £1.9million from the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and matched by investment from the supported businesses.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""It is vital that we continue to help support projects that have shown real benefits to local businesses and with innovation and research and development activities remaining key to future business development, this truly is an important investment. I am delighted that we are able to provide the support needed that will help keep this scheme alive and assist local businesses and local people.""

The success from Phase 1 really demonstrates how successful and effective this type of support is to local businesses. With 90 small and medium sized businesses supported through grants, nearly £1million of new sales has been generated for the participating companies.

One business to have experienced first hand the benefits is B&G Products Ltd - a company manufacturing handles for reusable cool bags used for protecting chilled and frozen foods. Based in Stafford and with large supermarket chains as their main customers, B&G had to find ways of retaining these customers whilst reducing production costs and battling with continued pressure to reduce prices. After redesigning their handles B&G used their Innovation Networks grant to purchase new tools to start production reducing the cost of raw materials used by 15 per cent and without sacrificing product quality. By cutting costs they were able to agree to new contracts with major supermarket chains and within six months of launching the new handle B&G had £126,000 of new sales.

Steve Shorthouse, Assistant Director at Coventry University Enterprises Ltd that manages the scheme said:

> ""The Innovation Networks project has a great track record of providing practical and accessible support to regional businesses that want to innovate. The flexibility of the scheme makes it attractive to a wide range of businesses, whether they are new start ups or medium sized businesses that are experienced in developing new products. The grant can be used towards any type of project related costs such as the purchase of machinery or tooling, bringing in technical consultancy or buying parts and materials. Any small or medium sized business that is currently planning to develop something new should look at applying for a grant.""

Led by the University of West London - one of five Centres of Excellence in Asian and Oriental cuisine - with the backing of the Department for Communities and Local Government and the financial support of Lord Noon, the programme underlines the importance of South Asian cuisine to the British economy and the need to develop highly-skilled British talent in a sector that has depended traditionally on attracting chefs from abroad.

The Department for Communities and local Government has worked with Noon Products Ltd and the University to develop the degree course and in addition to learning advanced cooking techniques and management skills, scholarship students will also undertake work placements at top Asian restaurants. They will also be mentored by some of the country's most talented chefs and restaurateurs including award-winning Atul Kochhar, Vivek Singh and Cyrus Todiwala.

Speaking at the University's award winning London School of Hospitality and Tourism Eric Pickles said:

> ""There was a time when, for most people, Asian cuisine meant a post-pub Friday-night curry. But not anymore. Our high-end Asian restaurants have been instrumental in changing the perception of Indian and Asian cuisine and many have reached for and been awarded Michelin stars, proving the nation's favourite food is just as sophisticated as any other.
>
> ""This is an industry worth over £3billion to the economy and we are fully committed to supporting British talent, all the way through from our favourite local curry houses and takeaways right up to our world-leading restaurants.
>
> ""We want to ensure employees have the right skills and that Britain remains one of the best places in the world for our chefs and managers to train. I thank Lord Noon for his generous financial support and look forward to others in the industry joining in to ensure that our young chefs get to the very top of their profession.""

It is hoped that the scheme will be expanded to include additional students and further institutions in the future. To achieve this, The Department is also working alongside the newly created Asian Restaurant Skills Board headed by Iqbal Wahhab - founder of London's Cinnamon Club and Roast restaurants. The Board will shortly be writing to potential donors who have a stake in the growth of the sector to seek their financial support for expanding the scholarship scheme.

Professor David Foskett, Head of the University's London School of Hospitality and Tourism, said:

> ""This is a unique and wonderful opportunity for students who are interested in South Asian culinary arts. This initiative from the Secretary of State is warmly welcomed and demonstrates the government's commitment to this important sector of the economy. It also underlines the emerging importance of South Asian cuisine on the global stage and the learning and career opportunities now available to students.""

### Notes to editors

1. The University of West London is one of five Centres of Excellence in Asian and Oriental Cuisine set up to help the sector address the wider skills and labour market demand for chefs in Asian and Oriental restaurants and takeaways. The four other centres of Excellence are in existing colleges and universities - located in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and central London - will, in collaboration with employers, train people to become chefs within the Asian and Oriental sector. People 1st, the sector skills council for hospitality, is leading the implementation of this programme. This will involve recruiting young people on to a pre-employment training programme, which guarantees them an interview with prospective employers and a paid apprenticeship in Asian and Oriental cuisine. The apprenticeship programme involves four days' work in a catering establishment and one day studying in the college. Successful completion of the apprenticeship will lead to a NVQ Diploma in Professional Cookery. Government funding is available for training apprentices - 100 per cent of training is covered for 16-18 year-olds, 50 per cent of training covered for 19+ year-olds.

2. The London School of Hospitality and Tourism at the University of West London has been chosen to pilot the 'high-end' scholarship programme because of the high quality of teaching standards, links with industry, and specialist knowledge of culinary arts and south Asian cuisine.

Plans to transform the city of Stoke-on-Trent into a thriving and successful centre are well underway thanks to a fresh injection of funding and an ambitious vision for the future.

Improvements will help enhance the image and appeal of the city to businesses, attracting fresh inward investment and job opportunities, and also help join up other developments taking place around the city from the Central Business District through to the Mitchell Memorial Theatre.

The public realm improvements, supported by £2.1million from the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and matched by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, are part of a package of improvements to develop and upgrade the city centre - creating a legacy for local people and making it more attractive to potential new investors.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""To improve the overall perception and performance of an area you have to get the foundations right. Stoke-on-Trent city centre is in great need of regeneration to ensure its future is prosperous. This has already started with key developments taking place in city and I am delighted that we are able to offer funding support to activities which complement these developments. From new street furniture to landscaped areas the changes planned will help create an attractive, vibrant and welcoming environment.
>
> ""As well as creating something special for local people, I also hope this investment will send a clear signal to private sector investors, helping to continue the much needed and on-going regeneration of the city centre.""

Residents, workers and visitors alike will be able to enjoy newly landscaped public spaces and street furniture, creating an attractive environment. The improvements will focus on the areas of Tontine Street, Percy Street and Stafford Street.

Councillor Ruth Rosenau, Stoke-on-Trent City Council cabinet member for regeneration, planning and transport, said:

> ""We're delighted to mark the start of these long-awaited works. It's a very exciting project. It will give the area a contemporary city style and feel, but retain its very special character and heritage.
>
> ""The area will become much more attractive and provide a more welcoming shopping environment, with natural stone paving and granite benches with ceramic detailing, plus new lighting, signs and trees.
>
> ""It's around 25 years since work on this scale and quality was last done in the area so it's literally getting its biggest makeover in a generation.""

Speaking at a special self-build workshop for local authority Leaders in London, Mr Prisk said that the first projects would benefit from over £1.1million to start work on up to 20 self-build plots.

Following final checks and approvals, the applications in North East Derbyshire and Peterborough will be the first to receive the funding, which provides short-term finance to help unlock projects where groups of self-build homes are built at the same time.

The Minister, along with self-build industry champion, architecture specialist and presenter of Channel 4's Grand Designs Kevin McCloud, hosted the workshop for local authority Leaders in association with the Local Government Association, to discuss how they could support prospective self builders in their area.

A specialist team from Almere in the Netherlands also attended to share their expertise. Almere, near Amsterdam, is the largest low-cost self-build experiment in Europe, which has grown rapidly in recent years.

Earlier this year the former Housing Minister travelled to Almere with a delegation from the UK self-build industry, and hosted an event with Dutch Government officials and business leaders at the British Embassy to boost trade and links between Dutch and British businesses.

Mr Prisk said that there had been a great surge of interest in recent years for self-build, and it was now important that local authorities learnt from abroad and local projects to identify opportunities for self-build development in their plans, and to give people in their area the opportunity to build their own home.

Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:

> ""Across the country, more people than ever want control over the design and build of their home. But these types of projects have often been held back because of limited land availability, reluctance by lenders to provide finance and red tape. So I'm delighted that the first self-build projects in Derbyshire and Peterborough have been earmarked for Government cash.
>
> ""This money will be repaid as plots are sold, and I hope it will demonstrate to lenders, investors and the development industry that these types of projects are worth backing. But it's not just about money, self builders and developers need the support of local authorities to get these projects off the ground. So I'm pleased we have the team from Almere to share their expertise, and I urge local authorities to learn from their example and help more self builders achieve their dreams.""

Kevin McCloud said:

> ""I'm delighted to attend this event today with the new Housing Minister and welcome the first approvals for cash from the Government's £30million investment fund which will help drive activity in the sector and give more people the opportunity to build their own home. But it is not just about cash, we need to see more support from local authorities if we're serious about making self build a mainstream housing option. And I hope we can draw inspiration from the projects like Almere, and many others across Europe, about what is achievable with strong local leadership and vision.""

Lord Taylor of Goss Moor will lead an external group that will look to streamline some 6,000 pages of practice guidance that explains statutory provisions, planning and the planning system.

Lord Taylor has invited Simon Marsh, Andrew Whitaker, Trudi Elliott and Councillor Mike Jones to join the group. They will be sitting as individuals and not representatives of their respective organisations.

The large amount of planning practice guidance currently used - added to over the years and often contradictory - makes it difficult for residents and businesses to engage effectively with the planning system. This review will streamline that practical guidance to make the planning system swifter and more accessible.

A clearer, reduced set of planning practice guidance will better support growth, help create the homes and jobs that the country needs, protect and enhance our natural and historic environment, and help put power back into the hands of communities.

The review follows the National Planning Policy Framework which distilled around 1,000 pages of planning policy into a streamlined, easy to understand 47 page document. This guidance review will not involve any changes to national policy set out in the Framework.

Lord Taylor said:

> ""I am very pleased to accept the role of Chair of the review of planning practice guidance. I am determined the review will make a significant contribution to the wider work on planning reform, and the aim to make planning simpler, more transparent and accessible for everyone involved in delivering sustainable development.""

Nick Boles said:

> ""The planning system needs to be supported by practical guidance that is clear and easily accessible if it is to be effective.  Even planning experts struggle to navigate the 6,000 pages of guidance that currently supports the system.
>
> ""I am delighted that Lord Taylor has agreed to lead this review of practice guidance and I look forward to reading the recommendations of his expert group.""

Matthew Taylor, Lord Taylor of Goss Moor, was author of the Taylor Review of Planning (Rural Economy and Affordable Housing - Living Working Countryside, 2008).

Peter Aldous' [Private Members' Bill](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/mobilehomes.html) (external link) is fully supported by the Government, led by the Housing Minister Mark Prisk, and has its second reading debate in the House of Commons on Friday 19 October.

Currently, many park home residents live in poor conditions and are unable to exercise their existing legal rights. The worst practices of dishonest site owners include:

  * blocking the open market sales of park homes on their sites - without justifiable reason;
  * neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs; and
  * charging excessive pitch fees and breaching site rules

These abuses have manifested in real-life examples where operators have lied to prospective purchasers about the conditions of homes and even dug holes around homes to make them unsaleable.

The reforms are designed to ensure site owners who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already while rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.

The proposed changes include:

  * reforms to the licensing system that applies to park home sites;
  * measures to prevent operators from blocking residents' sales in the open market
  * strengthening the existing law to protect occupiers from harassment and make it an offence to lie to prevent a home being sold;
  * a possible future 'fit and proper' registration to restrict the ability of unscrupulous operators from management of sites; and
  * a scheme to make pitch fee reviews more transparent and new rules on reviews so they are fairer and reflect the condition of the site

Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:

> ""Many people choose a park home expecting a peaceful retirement and a good quality of life. This bill will help to make that a reality by ensuring that sites are safe and properly managed and that residents are better able to exercise their rights.
>
> ""This industry has been blighted by rogue operators - these reforms aim to drive them out of the industry securing a fairer deal both for home owners and for the good operators, running decent businesses.
>
> ""This is why the Government is fully backing Peter Aldous' Mobile Homes Bill.""

A hard-hitting campaign offers a timely reminder that changing our clocks isn't the only important task to carry out over the weekend of 27/28 October - the clear Fire Kills message is that it's time to take life-saving action and test our smoke alarms too.

![Fire Kills poster showing a child](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2237695.jpg)""Do you swear on your child's life to test your smoke alarm this weekend?""

The simple task of making sure our smoke alarms work is something that many often forget. But people are more than four times as likely to die in a fire if they do not have a working smoke alarm, so the Fire Kills campaign is using the twice-yearly clock change chore to remind people that it's time to test.

Images of charred timepieces that bring to mind a child's bedside table, a grandparents' mantelpiece, and a quiet night in front of the TV, pull on the heartstrings to remind householders of the lives at stake if their smoke alarm isn't working.

In 2011-12, there were 30,709 accidental fires in the home, resulting in 187 fatalities and more than 6,000 injuries. The number of fatalities was 12 per cent lower than in 2010-11 and Fire Kills aims to keep these figures going down because behind every death is a tragic story of loss for family and friends.

Almost half of those people who died in dwelling fires last year were aged 65 and over. This year the campaign is urging carers, family and close neighbours to offer to test older people's smoke alarms for them as they are often out of easy reach.

While a working smoke alarm can buy people valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999, only half of all householders who own a smoke alarm say that they test it is working on a regular basis.

The campaign aims to make testing our smoke alarms part of every household's routine when changing our clocks, potentially saving many lives in the future.

Fire Minister Brandon Lewis said:

> ""The smoke alarm is a proven saviour, and while the great majority of homes now own one, that's simply not enough - it must be working to save your life.
>
> ""Keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from the worst should never be left to chance. That's why this campaign reminds us of exactly what's at stake if the worst should happen.
>
> ""The clock change offers the perfect prompt to carry out the simple task of testing your alarms and offering to test for other people - especially older friends and relatives who may find it difficult to do it for themselves.
>
> ""Last year, nearly one in seven adults tested their alarms over the clock change weekends and we want many more to test this year. A simple task, taking just a few seconds, can mean the difference between life and death, so add it to your 'to do' list now. Our message is clear - it's time to test.""

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""You're more than four times as likely to die in a fire without a working smoke alarm. But despite this, only half of the people who own an alarm say they take the time to test that it's working.
>
> ""Almost half the people who die in accidental fires in their home are aged over 65. Let's reduce this shocking statistic by offering to help older family members or other elderly people we care for and test their alarm for them.
>
> ""A smoke alarm can give you the vital time you need to get out, stay out and call 999 in a house fire. As you put your clocks back on the weekend of 27/28 October take an extra moment to make sure your alarm is working properly - it could save your life.""

Help keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the home by following these simple steps:

  * A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. Make sure you fit one on every level of your home and test them regularly.
  * Make testing your smoke alarm part of your household routine. Test the alarm by pressing the button regularly; change your battery once a year or invest in a 10-year alarm; and clean the alarm casing twice a year to ensure dust doesn't block the sensor.
  * Whatever happens, never remove the battery in your smoke alarm.
  * Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do in a fire and practise your escape route.

If you want an extra nudge to test your smoke alarm regularly, try setting an automatic reminder. Safelincs, in partnership with the Fire Kills campaign, has created a free service that reminds you, by email or text, when it's time to test your smoke alarm, change the battery or renew the unit. The service is completely free and can be cancelled at any time. For more information visit the [Safelincs website](http://www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders/) (external link).

Manufacturing businesses in the West Midlands now have the chance to try out and test new product prototypes and ideas through virtual simulation technology.

Use of the innovative technology on offer at the University of Birmingham and the Manufacturing Technology Centre in Coventry, will help businesses save time and money with costly repeat experiments which normally go hand in hand with testing new ideas.

The new project called CASiM2 is supported by £2.6million from the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and matched through funding and staff skills by the University of Birmingham, the Manufacturing Technology Centre, Airbus and Rolls-Royce.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""In order for businesses to survive and thrive new ways of working that save time and money but still gain the results is key. This project offers businesses an exciting opportunity to try out and explore the innovative technology by putting their new products and ideas to the test in a cost effective, reliable and safe environment. I am pleased that we are able to provide support to a project that will be really beneficial to the future development of businesses in the West Midlands.""

The project will firstly help to raise awareness of the new technology on offer and the benefits it can bring to a business, followed by a demonstration of its capabilities.

Professor Richard Williams, Pro-Vice Chancellor and Head of the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences, from the University of Birmingham, said:

> ""We are delighted to be driving the translation of our fundamental modelling and manufacturing technology developed at the University of Birmingham into industrial practice through this initiative in collaboration with the Manufacturing Technology Centre and partners. The partnership model encourages the application of frontier science in materials and metallurgical engineering and maximises the speed of adoption. It also enables effective feedback to the academic partners for future research.""

The delivery of CASiM2 brings together public and private sector organisations providing businesses who participate in the project access not only to the technology, but also valuable credibility from leading companies, Airbus and Rolls-Royce.

Stephen Burgess, Rolls-Royce Manufacturing Process and Technology Executive said,

> ""Advanced computational techniques delivering 'Virtual Manufacturing' capabilities continue to be increasingly important to Rolls-Royce as they enable evaluation, optimisation and verification of key manufacturing processes in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional experimental methods. CASIM2 is a collaborative programme that will deliver essential modelling and simulation capability to UK 'High Value' manufacturers and their supply chains.""

Ken Young, technology director at the Manufacturing Technology Centre added:

> ""The Manufacturing Technology Centre is proud to be working with the University of Birmingham, along with Rolls-Royce and Airbus to deliver the CASiM2 programme which recognises the fundamental role that SMEs will play in reinvigorating the UK manufacturing sector. CASiM2 will accelerate the delivery of high value manufacturing products and processes through the use of advanced simulation methods to underpin this future growth. Through the programme we have a fantastic opportunity to encourage, promote and transfer knowledge on the application of simulation technologies at an industrial level.
>
> ""We will engage SMEs in the West Midlands through demonstrating the commercial benefits of using innovative technologies to deliver step changes in their business offering.""

The new Growth and Infrastructure Bill will help the country compete on the global stage by setting out a comprehensive series of practical reforms to reduce confusing and overlapping red tape that delays and discourages business investment, new infrastructure and job creation.

The measures include:

  * Unlocking thousands of new jobs and billions of new investment in energy projects helping keep the country's lights on by allowing existing consents to be varied and releasing £160 million in new gas infrastructure;
  * Creating a new optional 'employee-owner' status for companies to offer, giving workers a financial stake in their firm's growth and success through tax-free shares;
  * Preventing unexpected hikes in business rates on local firms over the next five years. Tax stability is vital as business rates are the third biggest outgoing for firms;
  * Getting building going on stalled housing sites, by allowing the reconsideration of economically unviable 'Section 106' agreements. This could release some of the 75,000 affordable and private homes currently stalled. Unrealistic conditions currently mean no development, no regeneration and no community benefits;
  * Helping remove red tape which hinders superfast broadband being rolled out to local homes and businesses, especially in rural Britain facing a 'digital divide';
  * Cutting back the volume of paperwork which applicants have to submit with a planning application, which go over and above what is reasonably needed to properly inform decisions about the proposed development;
  * Stopping misuse of town and village green applications to undermine planned development, whilst protecting its use to safeguard cherished community spaces and ensure the protection of genuine town and village greens;
  * Implementing the recommendations from the 'Penfold' review to remove other over-lapping development consent regimes, where multiple permissions from different government agencies are required on top of planning permission; and
  * Speeding up the planning system for large scale business and commercial projects. Where developers choose the fast-track route decisions will be taken in twelve months from the start of examination. Existing requirements to consult local communities are retained.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""These common sense reforms will support local jobs and local firms. They complement the changes we are already delivered through the Localism Act, from streamlined planning guidance and, shortly, from the local retention of business rates.""

Planning Minister Nick Boles said:

> ""The Growth and Infrastructure Bill will boost investment and local economic growth. It removes confusing and overlapping red tape, whilst ensuring democratic checks and balances and environmental safeguards remain in place.
>
> ""Britain is in a global race today with rising nations like China and Brazil. Countries like ours will only be able to compete if we make it easier for businesses to invest and quicker for infrastructure to get built.""

The possible double charging has been identified by builders and developers as disproportionate and making key development and regeneration proposals unviable that would bring locally-supported homes and jobs.

Under the proposed change, applicants will be able to amend planning conditions on existing consents to make them feasible without having to pay another [Community Infrastructure Levy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/communityinfrastructurelevy/) on the same development.

Leading British developer Land Securities has announced it will proceed with an estimated £350million scheme that will deliver 2,500 jobs as a result of the proposed changes.

Planning Minister Nick Boles said:

> ""Stopping this unnecessary double charging is an important step in the Government's bid to do all it can to get the economy growing by supporting locally-led sustainable development.
>
> ""This is just one of many measures we have committed to in order to unblock barriers to growth and to make the planning system simpler and more effective.""

The Community Infrastructure Levy helps support growth by contributing to essential infrastructure.  Funds are raised from developers undertaking new building projects and can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development, including new or safer road schemes, flood defences, park improvements, green spaces and leisure centres.

The draft regulations laid in parliament - and soon to be debated - include measures to stop applicants being charged the levy twice, if they amend existing planning consents through Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

e2v were awarded £3.8 million pounds in the third round of Regional Growth Fund grants and the money will help create 130 new jobs at e2v and a further 30 jobs through their supply chain.

The grant is part of an overall investment of £13.5 million and supports e2v's strategic plan for growth within its space imaging business.

The money for e2v is part of the nationwide Regional Growth fund package that sees £1.05 billion in this round that will create or safeguard 240,000 jobs over the long term, benefiting 130 projects and leveraging £6 billion of private sector investment.

The 130 selected bidders to the fund, which will use public money to leverage private sector investment, were whittled down from an initial 414 applications through a competitive process.

The Government investment will help manufacturing firms, small businesses and local partnerships across England to expand their operations create new jobs and stimulate growth - the Government's top priority.

Whilst visiting e2v's manufacturing site, Mr Pickles said:

> ""The £3.8 million given to e2v is money well spent. It will create jobs for the local Essex economy and boost a company that is a world leader in cutting edge technology. I've seen their amazing systems first hand and have rarely witnessed such impressive technology being built here in Britain.

In June, the Government published an Overseas Territories White Paper; one of the goals is to raise awareness in the United Kingdom of these British communities, lands and seas around the world.

Last month, Mr Pickles announced a relaxation of the rules relating to the flying of flags to make it easier for the public to fly a wider range of flags without the need for express consent which could cost up to £335. The changes will increase the number of flags that people can fly, promoting integration and community spirit.

Mr Pickles has asked for the flags of the United Kingdom's Overseas Territories - from Anguilla to the Turks and Caicos Islands - to be proudly flown by the Department as part of a formal recognition of the continued important and close relationship with the country. This follows from a programme of flying England's county flags last year. The British Virgin Islands' flag is being flown alongside the United Kingdom's Union flag, which is flown all year round.

The flags will be flown at appropriate times in the coming months to recognise national days of significance. Britain has 14 Overseas Territories which encompass over 600,000 square miles and are home to 260,000 people - more than Nottingham or Newcastle. The Department provides advice and guidance to Territory Governments in areas where it has relevant expertise - in particular planning, housing, and fire safety and rescue services.

A major tourist destination and economic centre, the British Virgin Islands consist of around sixty different islands which are home to just under 30,000 people. At the ceremony of hoisting the British Virgin Islands' flag, Eric Pickles said:

> ""I'm delighted to see the flag of the British Virgin Islands flying proudly outside my Department. British Overseas Territories play a vital role in our sense of national identity and the Government's vision is for the Territories to be vibrant and flourishing communities, proudly retaining aspects of their British identity and generating wider opportunities for their people.

It is factually incorrect to assert that the Government's decision to postpone the 2015 business rates revaluation will increase tax revenues.

It will have absolutely no effect on overall revenues, but it will stop massive tax hikes for many firms - who will lose out from the significant volatility that the revaluation would bring. For the next five years, business rates will simply be tied to inflation, providing stability and certainty for businesses to plan and invest.

The Coalition Government recognises that business rates are a big burden for small firms in particular, which is why we extended small business rate relief, made it easier to claim that rate relief, and introduced new powers for councils to introduce local business rate discounts.

![Eric Pickles speaking at the Harvest Festival](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2241741.jpg)Eric Pickles at Borough Market harvest Festival

The event, held jointly with Southwark Cathedral, coincided with the Market's annual 'Apple Day' and began with the Dean of Southwark, The Very Reverend Andrew Nunn, leading a procession from the Cathedral into the market. A short act of worship including hymns sung by the Borough Market Choir was followed by a collection of food and clothing donated to the local Manna Day Centre for the homeless and the ROBES winter shelter project.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Throughout the year, Christian communities across the country help others through volunteering and supporting charities. These admirable activities are highlighted by the Government-backed 'A Year of Service' programme, where during Harvest Festival Christian communities are opening doors to other faiths and to the wider public. Whether it be raising funds for local charities or distributing food, every good deed serves to enrich and unify our communities.""

Sunday's Christian-led event was one of many social action activities taking place this month across the country to coincide with Harvest Festival and is part of 'A Year of Service' - the year-long Government-backed programme to highlight the substantial contributions made by faith groups and to introduce more people to multi-faith volunteering.

Christian communities throughout October are inviting people from offices, schools, youth groups and places of worship from other faiths to take part in volunteering-led activities including food collections, processions and organising multi-faith meals for students.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, said:

> ""This year, the unique A Year of Service programme is encouraging members of different faith communities and people of no faith to come together to volunteer and help improve local neighbourhoods. In most churches, Harvest Festival is usually celebrated only amongst Christians but this year partnerships are developing between local mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras in order to gather and distribute food. Initiatives like this can make a real difference in areas where neighbours of different faiths do not yet know each other and Harvest gives a good opportunity for them to work together to help the poorest people in their neighbourhood.""

Following applications by local MPs, over 300 Town Teams have signed up to become [Town Team Partners](http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/economicgrowth/highstreetsportas/townteampartners/), and will benefit from a package of support, which includes help from the Government as well as advice and support from leading retail experts.

The Town Teams Partners will receive an immediate boost, with national event to be held in Birmingham tomorrow by the Association of Town Centre Managers.

Mr Prisk said the extra support would help the teams to strengthen their leadership on the ground, and enable them to try new ideas on their high streets to make them more attractive and competitive.

### Designs for Deptford

To mark the announcement the Minister visited Deptford, a successful applicant to become a Town Team Partner. The team have plans to use the creative buzz generated by local artists by installing their art works in the high street and in local shops - from boutiques to the local fishmongers -  all under the 'Made in Deptford' banner.

Mr Prisk also saw the Deptford Project, a railway carriage that has been transformed into a cafe - a great example of how the Town Team Partner plans to transform the look of the high street and showcase local talent.

Local Growth Mark Prisk said:

> ""There's a real hunger in town centres across the country for them to be revitalised and remain attractive places to visit. So I'm delighted that from today over 300 Town Team Partners will begin to receive a package of support that helps them breathe new life into their high streets.
>
> ""No one's pretending that there's a silver bullet for improving the performance of our town centres. Yet as I saw in Deptford: with this new support, and the opportunity to learn from each other, Town Teams can channel their energy and enthusiasm into promoting a more exciting and competitive offer on our high-streets, and help them thrive for years to come.""

### Package of support

The opportunity to become a Town Team Partner received an overwhelming response from towns across the country, with hundreds of MPs submitting applications.

Each Town Team Partner will have access to:

  * help to get started and become established in their town

  * an advice line and a network of advisers managed by the Association of Town Centre Management

  * special national events to learn from other Town Teams, and secure support from industry experts and trade bodies

  * an online 'Knowledge Bank' with expert advice and support

  * regular meetings with other Town Teams to share tips and ideas, and

  * 'Crowdfunding' - a potential way to attract local investors and raise small amounts of finance to support their work.

All Town Team Partners will also benefit from a Government-sponsored fund designed to help towards getting their plans off the ground.

The list of Town Team Partners is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2241696.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2241696.xls).

### High Street x-factor

Town centres also have the opportunity to win the £1million [Future High Street X-Fund](http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/economicgrowth/highstreetsportas/).

The prize will be shared among the high streets that show the greatest improvements. Towns will be judged by an independent expert panel, for the inventiveness of their schemes and evidence of their impact, such as increased footfall or turnover, or improved skills and employment levels.

Towns will also need to explain how they plan to use their prize money to further support their high streets.",23-Oct-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Government is [asking for views](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/makingthecode) on plans to make it a legal requirement for councils to open up every aspect of its business through the regular publication of a transparency inventory that will reveal data on pay, perks, spending, charities and now parking. Overall council parking income totalled £1.27billion in 2010-11.

Proposed amendments to [The Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode) will also introduce new transparency standards on parking charges.

Councils will have to publish soon as it is produced the number of off-street parking places and the revenue raised from them; the number of on-street parking places and the revenue they raise; as well as the revenue from parking fines and the number of free parking spaces available in line with the Portas Review of the High Street recommendations.

A recent survey found that almost seven in ten people intentionally avoided shopping areas with high parking prices. Two thirds said they would return to the high street if parking was more affordable. One in five felt there were not enough spaces available. It also found that four out of five people pay up to £150 per month for parking.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We are ending an era of bureaucratic accountability and replacing it with a more open era of democratic accountability. It is right that taxpayers get to see how Town Halls spend their hard earned taxes so they can properly hold local politicians to account.
>
> ""Finally all councils have taken up the £500 transparency challenge but publication is only happening in fits and starts. By writing Town Hall transparency into law we can make certain every citizen gets open and equal access to information about local public expenditure.
>
> ""As part of that we will expose a great council cash cow cover-up unmasking punitive parking practices that hit residents in the pocket. We're calling time on local war against motorists - now, more than ever, we need to see the back of this shopping tax and encourage more people onto the high street.""

The proposals mean that all local authorities would be required to openly publish their spending over £500 online including, tenders, contracts, senior pay, councillor expenses, voluntary sector funding, meetings, and frontline service data so that 'armchair auditors' can clearly see the decisions being made on their behalf.

This department has been publishing details of all goods and services spent over £500 matching the level required of councils since August 2010. As one of Government's transparency trailblazers that is now being extended to include all transactions above a new low threshold of £250. 'Can do' councils have been challenged to match that threshold.

As a minimum the code states that the public data that should be released in every council's transparency inventory is:

  * expenditure over £500, (including costs, supplier and transaction information). Any sole trader or body acting in a business capacity in receipt of payments of at least £500 of public money should expect such payments to be transparent;
  * senior employee salaries, names (with the option for individuals to refuse to consent for their name to be published), job descriptions, responsibilities, budgets and numbers of staff. 'Senior employee salaries' is defined as all salaries which are above £58,200 and above (irrespective of post), which is the Senior Civil Service minimum pay band. Budgets should include the overall salary cost of staff reporting to each senior employee;
  * an organisational chart of the staff structure of the local authority including salary bands and details of currently vacant posts;
  * the 'pay multiple' - the ratio between the highest paid salary and the median average salary of the whole of the authority's workforce;
  * councillor allowances and expenses;
  * copies of contracts and tenders to businesses and to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector;
  * grants to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector should be clearly itemised and listed;
  * policies, performance, external audits and key inspections and key indicators on the authorities' fiscal and financial position;
  * the location of public land and building assets and key attribute information that is normally recorded on asset registers; and
  * data on democratic running of the local authority including the constitution, election results, committee minutes, decision - making processes and records of decisions.

### Notes to editors

1. Provision of public data should become integral to local authority engagement with residents so that it drives accountability to them. Its availability should be promoted and publicised so that residents know how to access it and how it can be used. Presentation should be helpful and accessible to residents and other interested persons. Publication should be in open and machine-readable formats. It should be published as soon as possible following production even if it is not accompanied with detailed analysis. Where practical, local authorities should seek to publish in real time.

2. The Secretary of State published _The Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency_ on 29 September 2011. The Code asks councils to follow three principles of transparency when publishing data they hold; responding to public demand; releasing data in open formats available for re-use; and, releasing data in a timely way. This includes data on senior salaries and the structure of their workforce. The code can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode).

3. The consultation is open until 20 December 2012 and can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/makingthecode](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/makingthecode). Subject to the consultation and introduction of regulations a binding code would take effect later next year.

4. Public data should be published in a format and under a licence that allows open re-use, including for commercial and research activities, in order to maximise value to the public. The Open Government Licence published by The National Archive should be used as the recommended standard: [www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/) (external link). Where any copyright concerns exist with public data these should be made clear.

5. Local Authorities will also have a statutory duty to maintain and publish other lists of assets for example, lists of assets of community value and lists of those assets nominated but not deemed by the local authority to meet the definition of an asset of community value. Local authority assets will be on land and building property assets.

6. The Localism Act requires local authorities to be transparent about how senior salaries are set through the publication of annual pay statements. This will help to ensure that local remuneration arrangements - particularly for chief officers - provide value for money for the whole of the public sector.

7. The Government's associated guidance on _Openness and Accountability in Local Pay_ states that authorities should review the terms of senior appointments, particularly where arrangements could be perceived as seeking to minimise tax payments. It specifically states that councils should vote on salary packages for employees greater than £100,000 a year. Councils should also publicly justify any big bonuses, above inflation pay rises, or the recruitment of staff already in receipt of public sector retirement or severance money. [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/guidancelocalpay](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/guidancelocalpay).

8. The data on gross sales, fees and charges income from parking is part of the _Local Authority Revenue Outturn 2010-11_: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/revenue201011finaloutturn](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/revenue201011finaloutturn).

First launched in 1996 the scheme has rewarded thousands of flags over the years, with a record number 1,424 sites receiving the award this year.

Mr Foster said:

> ""As thousands of tourists during the Olympics saw for themselves we have some of the greatest parks in the world in this country and I want to keep the standard very high.  This is why the government is pleased to announce that Keep Britain Tidy will continue to run the scheme, awarding green flags to those parks that provide great spaces for local people.
>
> ""Open spaces are essential in bringing people of all ages and backgrounds together, and are particularly important for the millions of people who do not have the luxury of their own garden to relax in or for their children to play in.  Green flags will continue to reward great parks across the country and challenge all the others to do even better.""

As well as parks the green flag award scheme is open to any freely accessible public open space, including woodlands, nature reserves, allotments and cemeteries.  Judging is carried out by an army of volunteer judges and parks that receive lottery funding are required to achieve green flag status.

Speaking today at the UK Parks Summit in London, organised by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Big Lottery Fund, Don Foster is also welcoming additional lottery funding to support parks saying:

> ""I am delighted that £100million of extra lottery money will be going to support parks over the next three years, getting local people involved and protecting historic monuments.  With the continuing green flags scheme these new measures are a real boost for the country's parks.""

Keep Britain Tidy Chief Executive Phil Barton said:

> ""On behalf of the partners involved I'd like to say how thrilled we are to have won the licence to run the Green Flag Awards for the next five years.
>
> ""We know how important this scheme is to the army of professional men and women who manage our green spaces across the country. We also understand that, in these difficult financial times, these professionals are facing significant challenges.
>
> ""It is only by working together that we can maintain the high standards set by the Green Flag Award and it is against this backdrop that we are delighted to be working with key partners who will help strengthen the scheme. Through this partnership, we will continue to spread best practice and raise the standard of our parks and green spaces.
>
> ""The new partnership believes the Green Flag Award is a model of how, by sharing good practice and celebrating and rewarding quality, we can raise the standards of public space in the UK, providing a range of benefits for local communities.""

Dame Jenny Abramsky, Chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund said:

> ""I'm delighted the Minister has made this commitment to the future of the Green Flags Awards scheme as it plays a vital role in inspiring local authorities and community groups to maintain their parks. Since 1996, the Heritage Lottery Fund and Big Lottery Fund have jointly invested over £640million to transform over 700 public open spaces.  The continuation of the Award - which we regard as a mark of quality all parks we fund must meet - will help safeguard our past investment along with our new commitment of £100million over the next three years.""

Peter Ainsworth, Chair of the Big Lottery Fund said:

> ""This is great news and encouraging evidence of the government's commitment to the quality of places and spaces where people live, work and play.""

In a speech to the Fire Sector Summit at Wembley on Wednesday, he pointed to new figures showing that, in London alone, a fire engine is called once every 12 minutes to a false alarm, at a cost of £34 million every year.

Last year, throughout the country, there were nearly a quarter of a million false alarms.

Speaking to an audience of fire professionals the Minister argued that many of these could be prevented through the use of new technology.

Mr Lewis said:

> ""I believe that technology can address this issue. To that end, I have asked the industry to see what can be done to drive down false alarms through improved equipment.""

The Fire Sector Federation has set up a group that is already looking at the use of more sophisticated technology such as multi-sensor fire detectors which can detect more than one factor such as smoke and heat. These are much more accurate at identifying whether there is a real fire or whether it is an environmental factor such as dust or steam that is triggering an alarm.

In addition, improved procedures can hugely cut the number of false alarms. A well known food processing company reduced its false alarms from nearly 50 a year to less than one by training fire marshals to investigate the cause of an alarm before the fire and rescue authority was called.

And Mr Lewis went on to say that by working together the sector could find financial savings as well as save lives:

> ""At a time when every penny counts, this is an obvious area in which to make large savings. Dealing with the number of false alarms has got to be a priority and I would encourage the industry and fire and rescue authorities to work together to develop a common approach to cutting back on something that not only wastes money, but potentially could cost lives, and I look forward to hearing their findings.""",26-Oct-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2247207,Independent panel to help government cut housebuilding red tape and boost growth,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government,don-foster,,"Communities Minister Don Foster today launched a new independent group of building industry experts, tasked with simplifying the mass of rules imposed on developers and housebuilders, to make them easier to understand and follow.

As part of the Government's Red Tape Challenge Ministers have made clear they want to do everything possible to remove unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy imposed on developers to get much needed new homes built, and support economic growth.  The current, complex system of building regulations and housing standards will be targeted by a new Independent Challenge Panel, which will consider how these requirements work together and what potential there is to free up the system and make it work more efficiently.

The panel will for the first time bring independent experts together with government and it will report to ministers in spring.

But Mr Foster also made clear that essential safety and accessibility protections will remain untouched and that homes will always need to be built to high sustainability and quality standards.

#### Housing standards review

But with the hundreds of standards that can be applied to new-build homes, some of which duplicate each other, a separate group will work alongside the new Challenge Panel to consider the specific issue of standards applied to housebuilding.

While some of these standards are applied nationally across certain types of homes such as affordable housing, others are made mandatory by individual councils for building in their area and some are entirely voluntary - resulting in confusion for local people and developers. Examples include:

  * The requirement for two phone lines in home offices, irrespective of need and in addition to broadband connection
  * Rules on window sizes that include a 'dirty window factor' - imposing bigger windows to allow for dirt on them, rather than assuming people will simply clean their windows
  * A requirement that 'drying space' is designed and assessed when often this is nothing more complicated than a washing line over a bath
  * Conflicting guidance on how to construct safe and accessible stairs
  * Standards being assessed repeatedly by different people - such as planners, code assessors, building control officers - often looking at the same issues  but coming up with different answers.

This new review, led by DCLG and to be conducted by a group of industry representatives, will look to avoid overlap and duplication in the system, helping ensure builders meet the high standards that aspiring homeowners rightly expect.

Don Foster said:

> ""The current array of different housing standards used in different parts the country is complex and counter-productive: confusing local residents, councillors and developers.
>
> ""This is why an urgent review has now started, bringing the government together with housebuilders, planners, councils and architects to establish what the unnecessary measures are that we can cut out of the system, whilst ensuring buildings are still made to exacting standards.
>
> ""I want to see a simpler set of housing standards that people can easily understand and that free up developers and councils to get on with the job of building the high quality new homes we so badly to get more first time buyers and families onto the housing ladder.""

The review was part of the government's housing and growth strategy announced on 6 September.  It will result in a clear plan of action by next spring that will be put out to consultation.

7. The Red Tape Challenge was launched by the Prime Minister in April 2011 and is systematically examining some 6,500 substantive regulations that the Government inherited with the aim of scrapping or significantly reducing as many of them as possible. It gives business and the public the chance to have their say, by theme, on the regulations that affect their everyday lives. The [Housing and Construction Red Tape Challenge](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/housing-and-construction/) was open for comment from the 12 January until 17 Febuary 2012. More information can be found on the [Red Tape Challenge](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/) website.

8. On 10 September the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced that through the Red Tape Challenge at least 3,000 of the cross-government regulations examined will be scrapped or reduced. By 'scrapped', we mean that regulation is completely removed from the statute book. By 'reduced', we mean that regulations are reduced in number (e.g. a consolidation, making the rules simpler to find and follow); and/or in terms of the burden they impose (for example: reducing who is caught by the regulation; removing domestic gold-plating of EU law; active renegotiation of EU law; simplifying requirements set by the regulation or in related guidance; or reducing the burden of inspection and enforcement arising from the regulation). Around 1,500 of the 3,000 changes will have a measurable financial benefit for business: this does not include consolidations of regulations without any changes to the content of those regulations. The Red Tape Challenge comprises regulation of UK origin and regulation that transposes EU laws. It does not include legislation or regulations falling within the responsibilities of the devolved administrations, tax and fees legislation or national security matters.",31-Oct-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The [consultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/parishdiscussionpaper) launched today is part of government plans to open up public services. It proposes amending existing guidance to speed up the process, clarifying how local authorities should consider local opinion, and making it easier for neighbourhood forums to start the process for creating a new parish council.

Cracking down on pointless bureaucracy and freeing local people who want to play an active part in society to create successful and thriving communities is a top priority for this government.

The Government believes where the creation of a new parish council has the support of local people, the local authority should work with the community to achieve it. This will enable decision making to be devolved to the lowest appropriate level.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Parishes are popular with people and for too long communities have battled with burdensome bureaucracy to get them created.
>
> ""Our proposal to remove red tape, simplify and streamline the current process to create Parish councils is commonsense.
>
> ""We want to give local people a real sense of community control in their areas, giving them freedom to make changes and improvements which best serve their community and area.""

Parish councils have a highly significant role in the Government's agenda for promoting localism and open public services. They have a close understanding of what their communities want and can tailor a wide range of local services including grants to local organisations and financing projects such as new community buildings and facilities.

Commenting on the proposals Councillor Michael Chater, Chair of the National Association of Local Councils (NALC) said:

> ""We welcome the creation of more new local (parish and town) councils to deliver wider services to local communities and be the voice of local people. We agree with the proposal to consult on how local councils could be given more power to deliver grassroots services and looking forward to hearing of innovative and radical approaches on how this will happen.""

The Local Government Finance Act 2012 received Royal Assent from Her Majesty the Queen today. The Act creates an economic incentive for councils to generate greater levels of income, support local businesses, create jobs and reap the rewards of success.

The Act supports growth by directly linking a council's financial revenue to the decisions they take to back local firms and local jobs. Local Government will receive a fifty per cent 'local share' of business rates and then keep any growth they generate on that share for a seven year period, providing a strong incentive to go for growth.

Prior to the Act England's local government finance system was ranked as one of the most centralised in the world. Last year £19 billion in business rates collected by councils was recovered by Government and redistributed back out through a complex grant.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The old flawed system of government handouts to local authorities encouraged a begging bowl mentality, with each council vying to be more deprived than its neighbour.
>
> ""This Act allows councils to stand tall, and rewards them for supporting local jobs and local firms. All councils, including the least prosperous, have the opportunity to gain from this system.
>
> ""These new laws could deliver over a £10 billion boost to the wider economy, and generate more business rate income for councils to help pay off the deficit and support frontline services that protect vulnerable communities.""

The Act also creates a new, fairer system of council tax support that will mean taxpayers can be more confident that work pays and the benefits bill is controlled. This will help reduce the deficit by saving £470 million a year. Council tax benefit spending in England increased from £2 billion 1997-98 to £4.3 billion in 2010-11.

From next year councils will run local council tax support schemes giving them an incentive to reduce fraud, promote local enterprise and help people back to work and off benefits. The Government has provided £130 million of transition funding to help councils develop good local schemes and promote best practice.

The Act creates Tax Increment Financing, which allows councils borrow against projected business rate growth to pay for vital infrastructure developments now.

It also makes a number of technical reforms to council tax, including powers to reduce certain discounts and exemptions that could help hard-working families and pensioners save £20 on a typical Band D council tax bill.",1-Nov-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The County Hall refurbishment is part of a major transformation programme that will save £85million over the next 20 years by rationalising the number of buildings used by the council.

As part of the official opening, the Minister was taken on a tour of the new office building redesigned to make the best use of office space and state of the art library which has already seen over 1,000 visitors in seven weeks.

Also at the opening ceremony were Olympic Kayak gold medalist, Ed McKeever and Paralympic swimming silver medalists Aaron Morres and Stephanie Milward. Local torch bearers and games makers also attended the community event.

Local Government Minister Baroness Hanham said:

> ""In the past two years I have worked closely with local authorities to encourage them, together with other local public bodies, to have a programme of asset management. Wiltshire Council has made significant progress with this and I am delighted to be able to see their innovative approach today at first hand. This will save Wilstshire's council tax payers at least £85million. As two thirds of all public sector assets are owned by councils, if they all followed this example it could potentially save billions of pounds, as well as making better use of public assets and improving services for local residents.""

Business entrepreneurs emerging from West Midlands universities will continue to be able to access vital support to get a new business venture off the ground, with the announcement of an additional £4million investment to support the programme over the next 3 years.

Following on from the success of the SPEED WM programme, phase 2 called SPEED Plus will provide 600 graduates and students with the opportunity to access tailored advice and support focussed on how to get a business idea off the ground.

The programme is supported by just over £2million from the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and matched by five West Midlands universities - the University of Wolverhampton, Birmingham City University, Coventry University, Keele University and Staffordshire University.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""Retaining graduates and the valuable skills they hold, by helping them to take forward creative entrepreneurial business ideas is really important for the future of the local economy. It is vital that we are able to recognise the success of support programmes such as this and offer additional funding to ensure they continue for the benefit of future graduates and students.

Whilst on the tour of the local area, Mr Pickles visited an Enterprise Zone, a previously stalled housing site and a high-tech research park to see the effects of Government investment delivered with a localist approach.

Mr Pickles began the day by opening a new training centre in the Alconbury Enterprise Zone, a former airfield and brownfield site. This new training centre will train hundreds of local people to further develop the site. Over the course of the development period, the Enterprise Zone will create in excess of  8,000 jobs in high-tech research, development and manufacturing. The site owners, Urban&Civic are working with JobCentre Plus, the local authority and local further education colleges to establish a jobs and skills 'hub' which will support local people into work with additional contractors and companies coming to the site.

The Enterprise Zone has already delivered a simplified planning process that turned around consent for the marquee ""incubator"" building in just 36 days and using its business rate benefits has attracted high-tech research and development firm Enval to the area.

![Eric Pickles opening the Alconbury Training Centre](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2250552.jpg)Eric Pickles opening the Alconbury Training Centre

Uniquely, the zone will be rolled out alongside a wider residential development which could include 5,000 new homes, public transport infrastructure including guided busways and cycle networks; energy, water and waste infrastructure; community facilities including schools and a health centre; and 700 acres of landscaped green space with over half a million trees planted.

During his tour, he also visited the site of the Northstowe new town which will eventually provide around 10,000 new homes. Planning permission was recently given for the first phase first which would see the development of 1500 new homes. Mr Pickles reaffirmed the Government's commitment to continuing to work with local partners to accelerate delivery and remove barriers to the establishment of this high quality new town. By unblocking the site, the Government has given a vital boost to local job creation.

Mr Pickles also paid a visit to the Haverhill Research Park and saw how the New Anglia and Greater Cambridgeshire Great Peterborough Local Enterprise Partnerships have contributed £2million each from the Government's Growing Places Fund. The funding will enable the provision of infrastructure and site works to open up a 29.5 acre site that will create 350 homes, employment space, a hotel and leisure facilities which will establish 2000 new jobs.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Local Enterprise Partnerships are unlocking much-needed local growth and providing strong local incentives for companies looking to invest. Using Enterprise Zones - like the one in Alconbury - and the Growing Places Fund, civic leaders and businesses are helping to create jobs, homes and leisure facilities that people need.
>
> ""There is huge potential in sites like Northstowe to boost local economies and we simply cannot afford to have them lying idle because of earlier agreements that are no longer viable. Britain is in a global race today with rising nations like China and Brazil. Countries like ours will only be able to compete if we make it easier for businesses to invest and quicker for infrastructure to get built.""",6-Nov-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2250552.jpg,Eric Pickles opening the Alconbury Training Centre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The [proposals](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/lgpsinvestmentpartnerships) would potentially allow councils to double the amount they can legally invest from their pension funds directly into key infrastructure projects in a new and more efficient way that ensures long-term value for the taxpayer.

Investment in infrastructure is a vital part of the Government's economic growth strategy. Innovative approaches that increase the amount of finance available for projects are needed to back ambitions for the economy and to help manage the inherited deficit.

The Local Government Pension Scheme England and Wales is administered by 89 separate local funds that hold combined investment assets worth £150billion.

Pension fund rules are there to make sure investment risks are spread across different types of investments to give taxpayers long-term protection. Fund managers are currently limited in the amount they can invest via partnership arrangements, which includes many types of infrastructure investment.

The proposals published for consultation today include an option to increase the current limit of 15 per cent to 30 per cent. This would clear the barriers standing in the way of better council investment giving them the scope to inject up to £45 billion in such arrangements.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Unlocking Town Hall pension pots so they can be used to invest in vital infrastructure projects is a common sense decision that will help this country complete on a global scale and get Britain building.
>
> ""By lifting the restrictions controlling local pension investments councils could pump a further £22billion directly into job creating infrastructure projects that will boost our economy.
>
> ""This is potentially a huge development and investment opportunity we simply cannot afford to ignore that also allows us to maintain long-term value for money for the taxpayer.""

A recent report by the Future Homes Commission said council pension funds could be used to build key infrastructure projects like new homes in the UK without increasing the government deficit.

Investment decisions remain for individual local pension funds, which have a duty to protect the local council taxpayers, and local services and to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest.

### Notes to editors

1. In November 2011, the HM Treasury, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Pension Protection Fund signed a Memorandum of Understanding. All parties agreed that there is the potential for mutual benefit for the Government and pension funds to facilitate investment in infrastructure. The parties agreed to work together to help establish the arrangements necessary for efficient and appropriate investment in UK infrastructure assets. The Pension Investment Platform aims to raise funds from both public and private sector pension schemes.

2. Two local authority pension funds, Strathclyde Pension Fund and West Midlands Pension Fund, are among the six founding investors already involved in the Pension Investment Platform.

3. The consultation applies to England and Wales only. It will run for 6 weeks from 6 November until 18 December. The consultation document _Local Government Pension Scheme: Investment in Partnerships_ can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/lgpsinvestmentpartnerships](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/lgpsinvestmentpartnerships).

4. Subject to the outcome of consultation, the proposals would relax the current investment regulations the Local Government Pension Scheme (Management and Investment of Funds) Regulations 2009.

5. Investment decisions are decided by individual local pension funds based on long term returns, which have a duty to protect the local council taxpayer, and local services and to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest. Diversified investment portfolios reduce risk to the taxpayer. This will help to minimise the impact of managing pension costs, stabilise the level of employer contribution rates and limit local taxpayers' exposure over the medium to long term.",6-Nov-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

### Council of Mortgage Lenders conference

* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

As a chartered surveyor, I feel I have some understanding of the housing and the property markets. But I come to this role recognising that, frankly, I still have much to learn, especially about the mortgage market.

So let me start by saying that I want to listen. The considerable expertise gathered here is something I will not ignore. Indeed, it's experience that I value. There will be times when we won't always agree, but if we work together, we can make a real difference in quite challenging times.

### A dysfunctional market

As a Government we inherited a dysfunctional housing market, whether it's freehold or leasehold. A market in which (for at least fifteen years) we have been building roughly half the homes we need.

The social consequences are considerable. Housing waiting lists have soared in many cities; hundreds of thousands of people been unable to buy or move, and that has seen private sector rents climb.

We also see some 1.6 million young people in their twenties and thirties still living with mum and dad, because they cannot afford their own place. That cannot be right.

### Government's role

That is why I make no apologies for saying that we need more homes, and we need better homes, for more families. More homes for tenants, more homes for owner occupiers.

It's why last November, we set out a comprehensive [Housing Strategy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/about/keymeasures/) designed to tackle our dysfunctional housing markets in the short and long term, rented or owned.

First of all, £19.5bn is being invested in much-needed affordable housing. We're doing this slightly differently by working with the private sector. Government has invested £4.5bn, and a further £15bn has come through private funding. It means we're on track to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes, by the end of this Parliament (with some 55,000 supplied last year.)

Secondly, we are taking radical steps to inject substantial investment into building homes for the [private rented sector](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/privaterentedhousing/).

The relationship between social homes, the rental sector and private ownership are often overlooked, and we're trying to bring them together.

Following the excellent report from Sir Adrian Montague and his team, we have committed to provide a £10billion debt guarantee and a £200m equity finance fund, to help lever in substantial new providers, including some established players from overseas.

To put it simply, we want it to be a bigger, better market, capable of providing tenants with more quality, and more choice.

Thirdly, we are reforming the [planning system](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/) and the maze of non-planning building consents. Don't get me onto the subject of the greater crested newt. We've introduced the new, simplified National Planning Policy Framework and we are now looking to strip away much of the bureaucracy around those other consent systems, to enable and speed up sustainable development.

Fourthly, we are determined to enable the re-use of previously developed land and of homes lying empty. So we've identified surplus government land, capable of providing 100,000 homes, and we've already sold land capable for some 33,000 homes.

There's more to do in that area, and alongside our multi-million programme to bring empty-homes back into use, the work is starting to provide real dividends.

So, I think from this can see we are actively pursuing a range of supply side policies.

### Helping home buyers

But as this audience will know more than many, tackling supply alone, is not enough. We fully recognise that there are serious problems with demand.

By way of context, tackling the fiscal deficit we inherited has, of course, been fundamental to our economic strategy.

By cutting the deficit by a quarter over the last two years, it's allowed us to retain the confidence of the global market to lend to the UK, and to do so at lower rates, than elsewhere.

And that means that interest rates here in the UK have remained lower for longer. But we recognise that consumer confidence remains weak.

Confidence is, frustratingly, both crucial to the housing and mortgage markets _and_ one of the most difficult things for Government to be able to affect.

The prolonged credit crunch and the continuing uncertainty in the Eurozone has cast a long, dark cloud over all of us, both businesses wanting to invest and families looking to buy.

But practical action can and is being taken.

The Funding for Lending Scheme is now providing a steady flow of credit into the marketplace.

And I gather from some of the major lenders that this is already helping them launch new products, some at a lower price. We've seen early signs of increased mortgage approval rates and I hope that continues.

And we have now extended the [FirstBuy scheme](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/homeownership/firstbuy), to help first time buyers, buy new build homes. In its first year we have seen over 8,500 reservations, with 3,000 sales already completed. It's why we've decided to treble the scheme, to assist up to some 27,000 people. And, of course, by helping first time buyers, we are able to unlock many more housing chains and help many more people.

Third, we have backed the [NewBuy scheme](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/homeownership/newbuy/), run by yourselves and the Home Builders Federation. Acting as a mortgage indemnity scheme, NewBuy started in March and we have already seen over 2,000 reservations. Indeed, the Home Builders Federation estimate the NewBuy scheme will assist some 25,000 families, and as a Government we have made provision for many more.

Now, all the signs are that, after a cautious start, NewBuy is progressing well, after a cautious start. Savills' recent research shows that NewBuy mirrors takeup of FirstBuy in its first few months.

But what more can be done? What can Government and industry, lenders included, do next?

Let me start by saying that I value the work of the CML and the work of the lenders represented here today, particularly in regard to repossessions. I want to pay tribute to the work of many lenders and advisers here, who have worked hard to help borrowers who are struggling to pay their mortgage by offering forbearance options.

It has been one of the most encouraging aspects of the recent recession has been that, so far, the level of repossessions has been far lower than in previous downturns.

But, we're not complacent. That's why I've extended the Mortgage Rescue Scheme by a further 12 months to March 2014, so that we can help more homeowners (who may be at risk of repossession) to stay in their homes.

I also recognise that the FSA and lending industry have worked constructively together to ensure there are now clear rules arising from the Mortgage Market Review. This is vital if we are to have a stable and healthy housing market.

But I think there's still more that the Government, and this sector, can do.

In these challenging times we all need to think differently. We need to be challenged in our assumptions.

For example, how as an industry can you bust the myth, that mortgages just aren't available? You've told us that 80 per cent of mortgage applications are accepted, so there's clearly a gap between the actual mortgage market and what people think is the case. What can you do, together, to change these perceptions?

Secondly, I see many consumer surveys (such as the well-known analysis on Generation Rent by Halifax) suggest that your potential customers are confused, by what's on offer. How could this sector improve transparency, to make it easier for potential customers to buy your products?

Thirdly, [Right to Buy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/homeownership/righttobuy/) is back on the agenda, and should be considered afresh. It's true, the scheme dwindled under the last Government, but we have now completely revamped it.

The potential discounts for tenants have radically increased, almost quadrupling in some areas to £75,000. And we have a concerted marketing campaign, which, over the coming months will continue to target hundreds of thousands of households to explain the changes, and how they can buy.

My question here is, are you aware of this change? There's a real opportunity here, right across the country. Are you ready to be part of it?

But perhaps even more importantly, there's a new market opportunity I want you to bring to your attention.

The self build market in this country has historically been tiny to be honest, both numerically, and as a proportion of the overall market. Industry figures suggest that it's only 1 in 10 new homes that are self-built.

Yet, in many other markets the picture is very different. In the USA 45 per cent of all homes are self or custom built, in France and Germany it's over 60 per cent.

Demand in the UK is now changing. The number of people now looking to build their own home, is at a record level.

Indeed, in a recent survey by the Building Societies Association 53 per cent said they wanted to build their own home, and interestingly two thirds of the people who want to build their own home want to within the next two years.

So this isn't a pie in the sky dream, it's a real ambition for many people.

One of the principle restraints to self build has always been finding a plot of land.

Communities have responded to this challenge by using Community Land Trusts. Groups of people across the country are getting together to build on local plots - whether that's in, Shropshire, Devon, Cumbria or right here in London.

And our new [Community Right to Build](http://www.communities.gov.uk/communities/communityrights/righttobuild/) scheme, which has just begun, will also make it even easier for larger custom-built projects. And planning authorities are now identifying land where self and custom-built home will be encouraged.

As a Government, we are determined to make self and custom build housing a realistic option for many more people. Hence the change to the planning rules, and the creation of new vehicles to enable custom-built homes to progress.

But to realise our ambition (to double the size of the sector over the next decade) we're going to need fresh thinking from builders and designers, planners and yourselves.

I know some members have already responded - with self build mortgage products up, from 14 to 24 in the last year. Indeed some independent predictions are anticipating lending will rise by 140 per cent in the near future.

Now I'm not pretending self build is the entire answer, but it's a element I want to encourage you to incorporate.

But I'd like to encourage you to go even further, and fully consider the opportunities of this market for your business. Whether that's by tailoring your lending products for builders and contractors (who are building custom homes) or extending products like Build-Out insurance, which can help reduce lending risks for your sector.

### Conclusion

So, ladies and gentlemen, I strongly endorse the principle of this conference - that all of us need, to think differently.

For too long we've had a dysfunctional housing market, with too few homes for a growing population. And, let's be clear, finance has been part of the problem.

But with reforms now in place to help both the supply of homes, and to ensure that appropriate finance is available to those who are credit worthy, we need to work together, to help us return the market to a sustainable, healthy state.

As a Government we are committed to these reforms and to working closely with builders and with lenders, so that we can ensure that many, many more people can finally get the home that they and their family need.",7-Nov-2012,http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/ministers/986547.jpg,mark-prisk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He told delegates at a conference on Tuesday that in just three months over 1600 enquiries have been received by the Community Rights Support website from groups interested in exercising the new powers and over £80,000 in grants have already been awarded.

The Minister was speaking at a gathering of over 500 community enterprise and social action practitioners held in Bristol by Locality, the UK's leading network of community and social enterprises.

Speaking to delegates, Communities Minister Don Foster said:

Community organisations and activists from across the country will meet at the convention to discuss how local communities can play a greater role in shaping their areas and hear from those who have already delivered ground-breaking projects.

Locality CEO Steve Wyler said:

> ""Locality '12 will bring together the most inspiring community organisations in the country. Within our membership there is an extraordinary reservoir of talent, knowledge and experience which has never been more important than it is today. In these difficult times, community enterprise, community asset ownership and community-led delivery of services offers a beacon of hope for us all.""

#### Notes to Editors

1. The Localism Act which was enacted on 15 November 2011 and is opening up opportunities for community groups, including social ventures, to bid to run local services and assets.

2. Recently the Community Right to Bid came into force so communities can 'stop-the clock' on the sale of valuable local assets and amenities such as post offices, village shops or community pubs, giving them time to put in a takeover bid of their own and protect it for the wider community's benefit.

3. A [Community Rights website](http://www.communityrights.communities.gov.uk) (external link) has been launched to give people more information about the new powers and opportunities available to them. The website will continue to grow and expand as more of the Rights come into force.

4. Practical help and guidance for those wishing to use the Community Right to Challenge is also available on the [My Community Rights](http://www.mycommunityrights.org.uk) website (external link).",7-Nov-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
