new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-2012108a,Responding to local needs to improve outcomes,Speech by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.,"Thank you for inviting me to give the keynote address at this year's National Highways and Transport Network Conference. I am also pleased that the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme is helping support this annual conference for the second year.

First let me say that I am very sorry I can't be with you in person, but I am glad that I can be virtually with you at least.

I am always interested in what the National Highways and Transport Network Surveys results reveal about what the public actually think about the various aspect of transport in their local areas. I understand that 75 local authorities subscribed to this year's survey and, given the total number of interviews in each area, this represents a significant insight into public perception.

As the minister with particular responsibility for local transport, how we respond and accommodate local needs is something at the very heart of what I am involved in day-to-day.

The coalition government has placed localism at the centre of its plans. I am pleased to say that we have made considerable progress. This has included the Localism Bill passing through Parliament and now becoming the Localism Act.

However, responding to local needs is about far more than an Act of Parliament. So let me say something about how this is working in the Department for Transport. 

Firstly, our future plans for rail will give local areas more say on their rail services, including a mechanism for local transport bodies, working with the industry, to more easily sponsor additional local services.

I have published our proposals for devolving the funding we provide for local major schemes to local transport bodies that comprise local authorities and local business, through local economic partnerships, working together.

Of course our capital funding via both the integrated transport block and the highway maintenance block is already effectively devolved. This is because what local authorities get is based on established formulae, and the recipients have autonomy in how they use the funds, allowing them to better respond to local needs and priorities.

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund has provided a large number of local authorities, often working together, with £600 million for schemes that create growth and cut carbon at the local level. I am particularly pleased with the wide range of proposals we were able to support, and local councils have come up with imaginative and innovative proposals. Yes, there was competition for the available funding pot, but as many of you know we received applications involving every eligible local authority in England.

The government is playing its part in setting out some high level messages supporting sustainable transport and especially cycling, whilst leaving the detail and delivery very much to be determined at the local level.

The nationwide campaign for road safety has for some years now been based around the THINK branding. I am pleased to say that because of the general upsurge in cycling in recent times - not least because of Team GB's success in the Olympics - we have recently announced a new THINKCYCLIST campaign. The key message is that drivers and cyclists actually have more in common than is often realised. The campaign is therefore about both groups of road users being aware of each other.

The coalition government recognises that well maintained national and local highways are important to the economy, to all road users and to local residents. 

Despite the difficult economic situation we inherited we are providing over £3 billion to councils across England for local road maintenance between 2011 and 2015.

Now I know there is significant scope for many local authorities to change their approach, to emulate the best practice to be found in well-performing authorities, to find efficiencies and to achieve more from their spending on local roads.

In these tight fiscal times, we must all - central and local government alike - use resources much more efficiently to get the best value for money for the taxpayer. 

There are over 150 different highway authorities, very often doing things in quite different ways. It is clear that councils can learn from each other and get more for less. 

This is one of the reasons why I launched the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme in April 2011 - a £6 million initiative running until 2018 to improve efficiencies and maximise returns on investment in highways maintenance.

One of the Programme's key hallmarks is that it is sector-led. So, working in partnership it is for local highway authorities and the providers of maintenance services, many of which are from the private sector, to determine the programme's scope and shape its content.

It's also an initiative rooted in this government's commitment to localism, devolution and empowerment.

I am pleased that the Programme's work is now well underway and products like the local highway authority collaborative alliance toolkit have recently been launched. It is already being used by several potential groups of local authorities to form their own alliances.

I understand that several further tools covering asset management and standardisation of contracts and specification are due to be launched this autumn, with others in line for user testing.

I was also pleased to see that the final report of the Pothole Review was published in April and that its recommendations got a good reception. The programme has now put in place an implementation plan to ensure its recommendations are delivered.

I would like to pick up on the customer, quality and cost work being done within the National Highways and Transport Network.

In my view the local authorities responsible for highway maintenance can better respond to local needs in their area, if they have a full picture of all three dimensions. These are:

Firstly, customer perceptions - as revealed by for instance the National Highways and Transport Network survey;

Secondly, quality - the technical quality of carriageways and footways as revealed by the detailed surveys undertaken by highway authorities;

And thirdly, cost - as reflected in the resources spent on maintenance.

Whilst this approach is currently being refined by the National Highways and Transport Network for highways maintenance, the concept may prove equally useful for other aspects of transport such as cycling, walking and road safety.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that work the National Highways and Transport Network undertakes, especially making information on local transport available to local people, is very important. The National Highways and Transport Network both elicits the customer's perception, and also makes it available 'warts and all' to everyone. This is in keeping with the coalition government's policy to increase transparency within all levels of government and throughout the public sector. And having the information widely available allows for analysis and continuous improvement in the outputs and outcomes.

So thank you for listening and I trust you all have an interesting and successful day.",transcript,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,,norman-baker,National Highways and Transport Network Conference,department-for-transport,8-Oct-2012,2012-10-08
new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/burns-20120926a,ATOL certificate event,"Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.","## Introductory remarks

I'd like to kick things off with a very warm welcome to one and all.

A big thank-you too, for making the time and taking the trouble to come along today.

## Open mind

The American politician Adlai Stevenson once said: ""a politician is a person who approaches every subject with an open mouth.""

Well I'm pleased to report that, when it came to reforming ATOL, this Government has turned that stereotype completely on its head.

And that's because we approached the issue with an open mind.

We studied the problem.

We examined the evidence.

And we not only talked to travel-trade stakeholders, industry experts and consumer groups, we listened to them.

I believe the end result is an ATOL scheme that better protects consumers in the 21st century holiday market.

## Time to change

ATOL has done a fantastic job of looking after the interests of consumers down the years.

But it was born in the 1970s. And, as everyone here knows, the way we book holidays and flights has undergone a radical transformation since then, especially with the rise of the internet.

Arguably, the paradox of the internet age is that booking a holiday has become a lot more convenient and a bit more confusing at the same time.

Clicking a mouse when you make that purchase is easy, but it's also sown seeds of doubt about what's covered and what's not, about who's protected and who isn't.

So it was time to change, time to update and modernise.

## Proof of protection & peace of mind

And we've certainly done that by taking two important steps.

First of all we've ended the confusion about whether so called ""Flight Plus"" holidays are included in the ATOL scheme. They are.

But, secondly, as of the 1st of October, when you buy a ""Flight-Plus"" holiday, a package holiday or even a ""Flight Only"" trip that's covered by ATOL, you will get one of these - a standardised ATOL Certificate confirming that you are fully protected.

So, whether you're on a website, in a travel agents or making a booking over the phone there'll be no more uncertainty and no more wondering.

Instead you'll have proof of protection and peace of mind

## Concluding remarks

People will now be able to say with absolutely certainty - ""I'm covered, I'm safe.""

But these reforms don't just mean better protection.

They actually mean better protection for more travellers - millions more in fact.

Add all that up and I think what you've got is a job well done and a change worth celebrating.

So before I conclude my remarks I'd like to pay tribute to everyone in the travel industry whose advice, input and sheer hard work helped make this all possible.

We really couldn't have done it without them.

Okay, nobody ever came to an event like this and said: ""that was a great day, but if only the Minister had spoken for longer.""

So, with that in mind, I'd like to thank you for listening and hand you over to Dame Deidre Hutton, Chair of the CAA.

This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the minister.",draft-text,making-sure-uk-airports-and-airlines-are-safe-secure-and-competitive-while-reducing-their-impacts-on-the-environment-and-communities,,simon-burns,,department-for-transport,26-Sep-2012,2012-09-26
new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/burns-20121022a,Airports Operators Association,"Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.","## Opening remarks

Thank you Andrew. Ladies and gentlemen.

And thanks to Ed for inviting me to speak today.

Over the years it has become something of a tradition for transport ministers to speak at the AOA conference….

Not only because it's firmly established as one of the most important events in the aviation calendar….

But also because it attracts such a distinguished and expert audience.

So I'm delighted to be here today - and to have this opportunity to talk about the crucial role that aviation has to play in our economic recovery.

## 20 years of change

Now - both the new Secretary of State for Transport Patrick McLoughlin and I are politicians of a certain vintage.

Together we have clocked up more than 25 years of service as MPs, ministers, and whips in government and Opposition - including for Patrick a three year stint as Minister for Aviation in Margaret Thatcher's last government.

Looking back over that time, it's extraordinary to see how the aviation industry has changed….

The deregulation of air travel in Europe, and the proliferation of hundreds of new routes from UK airports….

The low-cost, no-frills revolution, which helped make flying affordable to millions more Britons…

The global reassessment of airport security after 9/11….

And the impact of the internet on the way we shop for flights and holidays.

But while aviation has changed over the past two decades, our job in government remains precisely the same.

Dealing with debt.

Stimulating growth.

Pulling every possible lever to create jobs, attract investment, and help some people get on.

Patrick and I were part of a government that not only experienced the recession of the early 1990s…. but that also took the tough decisions needed to lead our economy out of recession….

Decisions that built a foundation for growth and prosperity lasting well into the following decade.

And that's exactly what we're in government to do again today.

## Transport and growth

I'm excited to be part of the ministerial team at the DfT, because I'm a firm believer in the transformational potential of transport.

In my book, transport doesn't just support growth. It creates it.

One of the reasons why Britain was so powerful in the 18th and 19th centuries was its relatively easy and affordable access to a massive world market.

It was Britain's mastery of trade routes - over sea and over land - that gave us such a huge competitive advantage.

Thanks to transport, Britain had better, faster and cheaper links to raw materials - and to a global customer base - than its rivals.

Today, it is the same ready access that is driving the growth of economies like China, India, and Brazil.

The lessons for developed countries like Britain are clear.

Simply making the best products is of no use if you can't connect with the right market.

For decades, Britain has failed to invest in its transport infrastructure, and we are paying the price today in lost growth.

It's why we are investing in our roads and railways, to reduce congestion and overcrowding, and link businesses with buyers.

It's why we are investing in a new high speed rail network - so firms in Leeds and Manchester and Liverpool can connect with customers in London and Lille.

And it is why - in a fast changing industry like aviation - we need a clear strategy to boost passenger service, and maintain our excellent air links with the rest of the world.

But as I will explain shortly, any such strategy needs to stand firm over a period of more than a decade - and across several General Elections. That is why it is so important that we take the time we need to get this right and to build a strong consensus of opinion behind the best option.

## What we're doing

There has been real progress under this government.

We are taking forward the Civil Aviation Bill to modernise the regulatory framework for civil aviation in the UK. The Bill enables the CAA to bring a strong consumer focus to its activities, improving transparency and accountability, and ensuring a better service for passengers.

The recommendations of the South East Airports Taskforce are being implemented, including a trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow to improve reliability and reduce delay.

We've announced a number of short-term measures to improve operations and stimulate growth, including £500m towards a western rail link to Heathrow….. a review of the UK's visa regime…. and the recruitment of extra border staff at Heathrow….

And in July we published a draft Aviation Policy Framework (APF) and have put it out for formal public consultation - so that the final Framework can be adopted by the end of March 2013.

The final version of this key document will then be a formal statement of government policy setting the high-level parameters within which any new proposals for airport development may be considered.

## Connectivity and hub capacity

These improvements are timely and necessary.

But they will not on their own solve our long-term connectivity and capacity issues.

We are well served today.

The UK is one of the best connected countries on earth.

London has more flights to more destinations than any other city in Europe.

And we are fortunate to have so many flights to important trading partners - and global financial centres - like New York, Singapore and Hong Kong.

In what is still a dynamic market, new routes and services continue to be added.

From the end of this month, for instance, the UK will be served by daily flights to Guangzhou - a city that has been held up in the past as an example of our national failure to secure routes into the developing Chinese market.

New services to Mexico City were announced only last week.

And of course new destinations are being offered all the time.

But UK aviation is not only about the South East of England.

We are fortunate in this country to have so many excellent airports outside London, which not only help attract inward investment, and provide access to the global market…they also act as major employers in their own right.

Of course the downturn has affected most AOA members, just like it has businesses throughout the economy.

But many airports outside London and the South East continue to perform exceptionally well considering the wider economic picture.…

From Manchester, which saw passenger numbers rise by 6% to 19 million in 2011, to Belfast International, and Aberdeen.

This growth is being supported by significant investment - at airports like Birmingham, Newcastle, and Bristol - to boost capacity and improve the passenger experience.

However; the growth of airports throughout the UK cannot disguise the wider reality that Britain has failed to follow Germany, France and the Netherlands in planning for our long-term connectivity needs.

The danger is that we risk seeing our direct European competitors benefiting more from the fast growing markets of emerging economies.

## Difficult decision

So we are absolutely clear.

Maintaining the UK's status as a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long term international competitiveness.

Yet - at the same time - we must also take full account of the social, environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport capacity.

This is one of the most difficult debates in transport.

Few other issues have the same potential to provoke a divided response.

Successive governments have sought to develop a credible long term aviation policy to meet the international connectivity needs of the UK……

And in each case the policy has failed.

Either trust in the process has broken down….. consensus on the evidence for the policy has drained away…… or it has proved too difficult to sustain a challenging long term policy through a change of government.

Not only can the aviation industry ill afford for this indecision and failure to continue.

The country can't afford it either.

## Commission

So the government has asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission.

Sir Howard's remit is to identify and recommend the options for maintaining this country's status as a global hub for aviation - and indeed as Europe's most important aviation hub.

The Commission will also evaluate how any additional capacity requirements should be met in the short, medium and long term.

The Coalition Agreement is clear, and continues to represent the position of this government.

But the Commission must consider all options if it to reach the best conclusions.

That includes a third runway at Heathrow, and schemes in the Thames Gateway proposed by the Mayor of London and by Norman Foster.

The Commission will be fair and open, taking account of the views of passengers, residents, the aviation industry, business, local and devolved government and environmental groups.

An interim report will be prepared for government no later than the end of 2013, and a final report by the summer of 2015.

We will be in a position to tell you more about the membership of the Commission and its terms of reference in the next few weeks.

The Commission's work will not clash in any way with the draft Aviation Policy Framework.

In fact it will complement it.

When we publish the final Policy Framework next year, it will still establish the high level aviation policy of this government.

That means it will set the parameters within which Sir Howard will consider the aviation needs of this country - and the options for delivering those needs in the short, medium and longer terms.

The Framework consultation is therefore an important opportunity to influence government aviation policy.

I want to thank those of you who have engaged with us during the consultation - and encourage those who have not submitted a response to do so in the next few weeks before the end of this process.

## Conclusion

Now of course I can't speculate on what the conclusions of the Commission will be.

But what I can assure you of is the importance of this work - and the determination of this government to find a solution that's best for Britain.

We will seek to involve the Opposition throughout the process.

And I hope all main parties will back Sir Howard's findings - because it's crucial that we make a commitment that transcends party politics.

The Olympics have shown just what we can do if we are willing to make big decisions, work together, and stay the course.

The success of the transport system during the Games was the result of co-ordinated planning by the Coalition and the previous government, Transport for London, the Department for Transport, and many other organisations over many years.

I would like to pay tribute to many of the companies and organisations represented here today who worked so hard during the Olympics to provide such a welcoming and professional service to visitors who flew in from all over the world.

This was a major logistical challenge for the aviation industry.

Many predicted failure.

But you showed a real spirit of collaboration and collective determination to turn it into a triumph.

And it is that same spirit - of working in partnership towards common goals - that we need to foster again…. once conclusions have been drawn from the work of the Commission and the Aviation Policy Framework.

I think we all realise that we are living through some of the toughest economic conditions for generations.

But we are also living through a time of great opportunity.

Either we can repeat history, and fail once again to confront the infrastructure problems which hold our economy back.

Or we can learn the lessons from history, and build a better future for Britain.

That is what we are doing in government. And with your help, that is what we will do.

Thank-you very much indeed.",transcript,making-sure-uk-airports-and-airlines-are-safe-secure-and-competitive-while-reducing-their-impacts-on-the-environment-and-communities,,simon-burns,,department-for-transport,22-Oct-2012,2012-10-22
new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/burns-20121029a,Guild of Travel Management Companies conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Simon Burns MP, Minister of State for Transport.","## Opening remarks

Thank you for that introduction Ian (Ian Taylor - travel writer/journalist & conference host).

And thank you also to everyone at the Guild for asking me along, it's a genuine pleasure to be here today.

## Can't and won't ignore the facts

Now, I'm not sure if there are any fans of the ""Yes Minister"" TV series in the audience.

For those of you too young to remember, ""Yes Minister"" was the 1980s version of ""The Thick of it"" but without the four letter words. 

Well, there's one scene where the civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby, says of the Minister Jim Hacker - ""if he can't ignore the facts he's no business being a politician.""

To be honest, based on that definition of politics I'm definitely in the wrong profession.

And that's because, when it comes to the relationship between Britain's transport system and Britain's business travellers I can't, and I won't, ignore the facts.

And the facts are these:

  * Today we have to earn our living and pay our way in a fast moving global economy.
  * A global economy in which this Association's members face cut-throat competition. 
  * A global economy where the state of your transport system can be the difference between missing a meeting or making a deal…between winning a contract or losing a customer.

And I have to tell you that those facts have not been lost on the countries we compete against.

They know that creaking and crumbling transport links are a business burden that cost time and money.

Look around the world - the evidence is there in plain sight.

From North America to Latin America, and from our continental neighbours to the emerging economic powers of China and India, nation after nation is upgrading and expanding their transport infrastructure

Every bridge they construct, every road they repair and every track they lay is a boost for their businesses and their economies. 

So we really don't have the luxury of sitting back and looking on while our rivals invest in world class transport.

They are our competition in the international marketplace, the economies we're up against in a race to win the future. 

And, if we're going to out-produce, out-innovate and out-sell them, we cannot afford to be left behind in the starting blocks.

## Status quo - Latin for the mess we're in

That's something this Guild and its members understand only too well

You know better than anyone that ours is a trading nation, as well as an island nation.

A nation where what we sell in Boston or Shanghai is just as important as what we make in Bristol or Sheffield.

That's the reality. 

It's the reason you have consistently called for a transport system that is high quality and high performance - one that helps, not hinders, our business travellers.

Well, I want you to know that we hear what you say

And trust me…those aren't just warm words from a minister. The record proves that this is an issue where we are on your side and in your corner.

In fact, the minute we took office, this government made it clear that maintaining the transport status quo was not an option.

After all, as someone once said, ""status quo is simply Latin for the mess we're in""

Believe me, that translation has more than a ring of transport truth about it because frankly, we didn't just inherit a financial deficit back in May 2010, we inherited an infrastructure deficit too.

And that's precisely why we took the deliberate decision to focus time, effort and resources on making Britain's transport networks fit for the 21st century.

Now, I'll admit that the DfT hasn't enjoyed its best media coverage lately.

And I don't for one minute seek to carp or complain about that coverage

Serious matters like the west coast mainline bid tend to generate serious headlines. 

They also demand a serious response - which is why we are facing up to what went wrong and putting things right.

None-the less, I genuinely hope that none of the recent coverage obscures the bigger transport picture.

Because, I can say with absolute conviction that there has been real success and welcome progress on many of the transport issues that matter most to the people you represent.

## Renewing and rebuilding the railways 

Take the way we're renewing and rebuilding the railways that so many of your members use and rely on.

We're engaged in a massive modernisation effort. And just this summer we announced a new rail investment programme worth more than £9 billion.

We're driving through landmark projects like Crossrail, Thameslink and the Northern Hub.

We're going to electrify more than 850 miles of track.

And, right across the country, we're making rail travel a whole lot better with new services and extra carriages, more seats and faster journeys.

But our focus doesn't begin and end with the conventional railways.

Just like this Guild, the government recognise the huge benefits of high speed rail.

But again, just like you, we also know that our country and our economy need more than a high speed line - they need a high speed network.

And that's exactly what we're committed to building with HS2.

A network that not only links London and Birmingham. 

But one that also speeds further north to Manchester and Leeds, and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.

A network that not only opens up business opportunities at home.

But one that also opens up business opportunities abroad by ensuring passengers have an opportunity to connect up with the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport.

HS2 will transform the way we live and work every bit as much as it transforms the way we travel

So make no mistake, the government is determined to push this project across the finishing line.

## First class highways

But of course, business travellers don't just need top-notch railways - they also need first rate highways. 

So we've been investing in this country's roads and motorways too:

  * Cutting congestion by removing bottlenecks and tackling pinch points on vital corridors like the M5 and the M27
  * Using innovations like hard shoulder running and managed motorways to unlock capacity on crucial arteries like the M1 and the M25
  * Even supporting the uptake of electric cars with a nationwide network of re-charging points.

All this, and more, is designed to help motorists here and now.

But we've also been thinking carefully about the key long-term challenges by undertaking a major Feasibility Study: 

  * Looking at how we can best secure new investment capital 
  * Reviewing new models of ownership and financing
  * And weighing up the most effective and efficient ways to maintain and modernise our strategic road network 

Today and tomorrow - modern highways for a modern Britain.

That's our vision, and that's what we're working hard to deliver.

## Aviation 

Having spoken about rail and road, let me now turn a subject that rarely fails to generate debate and discussion - aviation.

Ever since the Wright Brothers defied gravity, air travel has shrunk our world.

But, in doing so, it has also broadened our horizons - personal and business 

So it's little wonder that issues like airport capacity and connectivity are high on the agenda for this Guild and its members.

Well, as the minister responsible for aviation, my response is the same. 

I'm with you - aviation is a big deal. It matters, it counts.

So let me quickly walk you through some of the things being done to make sure the aviation sector is successful and sustainable 

We're steering the Civil Aviation Bill through Parliament - legislation that will improve the passenger experience by reforming the 25 year old set of regulations that currently govern our main airports.

We're just about to finish consulting on our draft Aviation Policy Framework- a framework that forms the basis for future sustainable aviation growth in the UK. 

To increase reliability and reduce delays we've been trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow

And, from electrifying rail tracks to building new rail links, we're improving the connections between the train and the plane at airports like Stansted and Cardiff, Luton and Manchester, Birmingham and Heathrow, Gatwick and Coventry.

These are all global gateways to new markets and new customers.

And they're all set to become much easier places to get to, and fly from, when you're travelling on business.

We're thinking ahead too. 

We need to make sure that the future of aviation in Britain is one where our airports are globally competitive and where you can connect to places all over the world.

And I'm not talking about the future as just the next 4, 5, 6 years - but in terms of the next 4, 5 and 6 decades.

Capacity, connectivity, hub status - aviation faces long-term challenges that require long-term solutions.

And lots of people and lots of organisations have ideas about how to meet those challenges, including this Guild.

That's why we've asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission to consider the connectivity needs of the UK, and to make recommendations to government on how those needs can be met.

And I expect that Sir Howard will soon be setting out further details on the membership of the Commission and its work, including how he intends engaging with interested parties.

The government is determined to build the consensus needed to deliver a lasting solution to the issue of the UK's aviation capacity and we believe that Sir Howard Davies' Commission is the way to do that. 

So yes, the Commission is in its early stages, but we are convinced that it will deliver and help us to maintain the UK's hub status. 

## Wi-fi

There's one last area I want to talk about.

It's not the usual ""planes, trains and automobiles"" stuff of business travel. But, in today's internet driven world, it's perhaps just as important.

I'm talking about Wi-fi connections.

The modern business traveller doesn't just ply their trade in face to face meetings.

With a smart phone, a lap-top or the latest touch-screen tablet they work on the move, they work at home and they work outside of normal office hours.

And that makes fast and reliable Wi-fi connections a business must, a business essential.

You know it. Your members know it. And I'm pleased to be able to tell you that this government knows it too.

We've made broadband one of our top infrastructure priorities and published a National Broadband Strategy. 

We've set up a ""Broadband Delivery UK"" team in Whitehall.

We've given that team £530 million to help bring superfast broadband to homes and businesses across the country.

And we've announced a special £100 million fund to help ten major cities become ""super-connected cities.""

This country's Britain's business travellers deserve world class Wi-fi connections, as well world class transport connections - and we're working hard to delver both.

## Concluding remarks

If Britain's transport networks are its arteries of trade, then this Guild's members are surely the heartbeat.

Our business travellers - clocking up the miles, putting in the hard graft, making sure that Britain is always open for business.

So, before I conclude, I just wanted to pay tribute to the work you do and the difference you make - this minister and this government recognise, value and appreciate everything you're doing. 

Okay, having started off with a quote from a British comedy, I'd liked to finish off with one by an American President - Harry Truman.

President Truman once offered the following advice on public speaking - ""If you can't convince 'em, confuse 'em.""

Well, I hope that in speaking to you today I've been more convincing than confusing. I've certainly enjoyed having this chance to come along and talk about some of the things we're doing to support the crucial work you do.

So I thank you for you time. I thank you for listening. And I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.

Thank you.

Thank you for that introduction Julie (Julie Hilling - Chair of APPG). And many thanks for asking me along today. 

The reputation of this group and its members as rail champions for the north really does go before you, so I'm genuinely delighted to be here. 

I'd like to kick things off with a promise - always a hostage to fortune for a politician I know.

But anyway, here it is.

I know you all have packed diaries and busy schedules - so I promise to try and keep my speech short.

I was going to say keep it ""brief"".

But, since becoming a minister, I've discovered that Whitehall is the only place on earth where, without a trace of irony, the term ""brief"" is used to describe a ten thousand word document.

Modern enough, connected enough, fast enough

Now, I have a pretty straightforward view about Britain's rail network, and it's this - out-dated and over-burdened railways just won't cut it in today's global economy. 

They cost hard working families and hard pressed businesses time and money. And, in these testing economic times, you can be sure they are anything but an engine for powering up the recovery.

They don't do our environment too many favours either. 

Let's be honest, relying on creaking and crumbling rail infrastructure is no way to shrink transport's carbon footprint.

So, it doesn't matter if it's a regional link or a national network - Britain needs railways that are modern enough, connected enough and fast enough:

  * Modern enough to support economic growth and spur job creation.
  * Connected enough to spread prosperity and open up life-changing chances for people.
  * And fast enough to attract passengers and freight away from less eco-friendly alternatives like long-distance road travel and short-haul flying.

## Rolling up our sleeves

I am absolutely convinced that a good rail system can do great things - socially, economically and environmentally.

But, as we all know, the good and the great don't come about simply because politicians are very keen on them. 

No, you only get concrete results by rolling up your sleeves and getting on with it. And that's precisely what this government's been doing on rail:

  * £18 billion invested in our railways during this Spending Review period.
  * A massively ambitious programme of rail modernisation
  * And a range of groundbreaking reforms…. …from driving down costs and driving up efficiencies to devolving decision-making.

Indeed, on the second of those reforms, devolution, I know that there was a big response from people and organisations in the north to our rail decentralisation consultation…so I want to thank everyone who took the trouble to have their say.

No community left out, no region left behind.

This is a government that believes in top quality railways. 

And that belief is underpinned by a rock-solid principle. Namely that no community should be left out, no region should be left behind. 

As far as I'm concerned, if we want all of Britain to be open for business then we can't afford for any part of Britain to be isolated or disconnected from the country's wider transport system. 

Local, and actually national success, demands that north, south, east and west are plugged in and joined up.

## Transforming the performance and prospects of rail in the north

This is the very reason that transforming the performance and the prospects of rail in the north is a first order priority for the government.

Now, when it comes to one particular component of rail services in the north, I'll admit that the DfT hasn't enjoyed its best media coverage lately. I'm of course talking about the west coast mainline bid.

And I don't for one minute seek to carp or complain about that coverage.

Serious matters tend to generate serious headlines. 

They also demand a serious response…which is why we are facing up to what went wrong and putting things right.

None-the less, I genuinely hope that none of the recent coverage obscures the bigger, and more positive, picture about what's happening to rail in the north.

Take our recent approval of a £4.5 billion contract to build a new generation of intercity trains at a purpose-built factory in County Durham. 

This means that passengers will be speeding along the tracks onboard new high-tech, high-spec trains. 

But there's also a welcome employment bonus, with the creation of 730 skilled jobs, as well as another 200 jobs during construction.

And let's not forget our HLOS announcement - a £9.4 billion investment programme that will uplift rail capacity and improve rail connections right across the north.

I'm also pleased to say that work is well underway on the north-west electrification scheme….improving travel between Manchester and Liverpool.

But we're not stopping there.

Because we also intend building a brand new electric passenger and freight corridor - a rail spine linking the towns, cities and economies of the North, with the towns, cities and economies of the Midlands and south of England such as Sheffield, Nottingham, Reading and Southampton. 

The electric trains that run on these lines will be cleaner and cheaper to run than diesels.

They'll have better acceleration and shift greater loads.

And they'll carry more passengers with fewer delays.

In plain English our investment is good for passengers, good for business and good for the environment.

I can also tell you that funding worth some £240 million will mean that rail users in the North enjoy more seats, quicker journeys and better services on the East Coast Main Line.

And of course, the communities and companies of the region are set to be big winners from the backing the government is giving to the northern hub.  
And let me say this - the Northern Hub is about the transforming the rail experience across the whole North, from Newcastle in the north-east to Liverpool in the north-west. 

Now, in terms of travel benefits this is a genuine landmark enterprise. 

But there's even better news

And that's because Network Rail estimate the northern hub will also bring over £4 billion worth of wider economic benefits to the region and potentially as many twenty to thirty thousand new jobs. 

If you'll forgive the unintended pun, looking down the track there is another game-changing rail modernisation heading towards the North - HS2. 

This national high speed rail network will slash journey times and deliver a step change in capacity on routes between Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, London and Manchester - and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Firms in the north will be able to use HS2 to exploit new markets and attract new investment.

While the region's communities will have better access to jobs and essential services.

HS2 is a core component of the government's long-term transport strategy.

And so, for the sake of every region, it's a project we're determined to push across the finishing line. 

## Concluding remarks

Okay, I think it's time I kept the promise I made right at the start of this speech by winding up my remarks.

And let's be frank, nobody ever complained that a politician's' speech was too short.

So, if I may, I'd like to finish with a quote by one of America's founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin.

Now I grant you that's a less than orthodox way to end a rail speech. 

But, for me, this quote sums up our approach to rail modernisation.

Back in the 18th century Ben Franklin argued that, when it came to governing, ""well done is better than well said.""

If you ask me, that's a yardstick which still stands the test of time.

But I'm equally sure that, judged against it, the way this government is renewing, rebuilding and reforming our railways proves that, just like the great man said - actions really do speak louder than words.

Thank you.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20121022a,Place West London conference,"Speech by Stephen Hammond, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport.","## Introduction

I'd like to begin by thanking Place London for inviting me to today's event, and to Richard [Barnes, Chair] for that kind introduction.

It's wonderful to see so many people here with an interest in this part of the city.

I may be new to this ministerial brief, but I'm not new to London. As MP for Wimbledon, this is my home patch.

So I can reassure you that investment in the infrastructure, regeneration, and the economy of West and South West London is very close to my heart.

This year we've seen London host a spectacular Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The Olympic Park might have been in East London, but the whole city embraced the Games, including West London with events at Wembley and Earl's Court.

London 2012 - we planned, we built and we delivered.

So we can all take pride in the way our Capital showed itself to the world this year.

As a city that takes massive infrastructure projects in its stride.

As a city that deals with huge numbers of commuters, visitors and residents.

And as a city that successfully staged the greatest show on earth.

The challenge is to keep up that momentum, and make sure we're planning ahead so that London stays where it should be - at the top of the list of world cities.

That will require continued investment in transport.

To relieve congestion as the city grows.

To make new links, connecting people and businesses

And to support regeneration projects that are vital to development.

This government is putting in the resources because we know that giving people and businesses access to a high quality, high performance transport system makes sense for our country's future prosperity.

That's why, in the current Spending Review period, we committed £30 billion to road, rail and local transport projects across the country.

But we also understand that investment is vital for our capital

  * to support a labour productivity rate here in London that's more than 31% above the national average.
  * to maintain the City's position as the world's number one financial centre
  * and to fuel an economy that accounts for around 19% of UK GDP

London is Britain's economic engine.

And, by investing in the transport infrastructure that serves and supports the Capital, we can keep that engine powered, for the benefit of the whole country.

## Aviation

I know that, for many of you, aviation is one of the key transport issues at the moment, especially on this side of London.

So there's a legitimate debate to be had about the future of aviation.

But it's important that debate is informed by the facts rather than by anecdote.

In Heathrow, we've got the busiest international airport anywhere in the world.

And our Capital and our country are among the best connected places on the planet.

Without question we are in the global aviation premier league.

But as my colleague the Secretary of State reminded us in his recent Party Conference Speech in Birmingham, it's not going to last, if we don't act.

Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh all have first rate airports too.

But in the south east the runways are filling up and the planes are being left to circle in our skies.

So in the short term we're increasing reliability and reducing delays by trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow

But it's vital that we think long-term about how we remain globally competitive and globally connected.

Of course there are all sorts of ideas - usually as many ideas as there are people in the room.

So we've asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission to consider the connectivity needs of the UK, and to make recommendations to government on how those needs can be met.

The Commission will provide an interim report to the government no later than the end of 2013 and then publish a final report by the summer of 2015.

I expect that Sir Howard will soon be setting out further details on the membership of the Commission and its work….including how he intends engaging with interested parties.

So, if you class yourself as an interested party, then watch this space.

## Investment in London's transport infrastructure

I'd like to talk now about some of the other transport projects that are already underway.

Improving the road networks that serve London for example.

Whether it's working with TfL and ensuring that utility companies speed up their road-work, or it's easing congestion on key strategic roads, like the M25, through innovations such as hard shoulder running and managed motorway technology.

Then there's the Tube upgrade programme - work that will deliver a 30% increase in the capacity of the Tube network.

West London is already starting to see the benefits; the entire fleet has been replaced on the Metropolitan Line, with 58 new longer, air-conditioned trains, with the same to follow on the Hammersmith and City Line.

Also in West London, Royal Oak has seen the first two Crossrail Tunnel Boring Machines begin their journey under the city.

When completed, Crossrail will deliver faster journey times and a 10% uplift in capacity.

It will bring an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of London's business centres.

And it will support employment growth of up to 30,000 jobs by 2026 in Central London.

The Crossrail scheme as planned will deliver 8 new underground stations in the central section.

27 upgraded and reconstructed surface stations.

And up to 14,000 jobs during the peak construction period in 2014.

By 2026, we estimate it will carry 200 million passengers each year.

The impact will be felt all the way along its route, not just in central London.

Crossrail is already having an impact on investment decisions, supporting and accelerating new development.

This includes thousands of new homes, and millions of square metres of commercial office space within one kilometre of stations along the route.

Recent research has estimated that residential capital values immediately around stations could increase by 25% in central London and by 20% in the suburbs.

But despite all the planned investment in the tube and Crossrail, demand forecasts show that, without additional investment, crowding will return to unacceptable levels by 2030.

So thinking is needed now about how to address this challenge.

One option championed by many in the business community is Crossrail 2.

Something I know TfL are studying closely…and I look forward to reading their analysis when it's completed.

Then there are TfL's proposals to extend the Northern Line from Kennington to Battersea.

This is an extension that would improve transport links and support the transformation of Nine Elms and Vauxhall, a designated regeneration area on the South Bank.

Up to 25,000 jobs and 16,000 new homes could be created and journey times from Nine Elms or Battersea to the West End or the City would, in some cases, be less than 15 minutes.

## HS2

Rail capacity will also get a major boost from HS2, our national high speed rail network.

HS2 has the potential to transform the entire country's social and economic geography.

But think about the potential positives for London:

  * better connectivity and faster journeys between economy of London and the South East and the economies of the Midlands and the North
  * our major cities brought closer to the Capital and closer to the cities of Europe
  * new opportunities, new markets and new customers for London's businesses

This is a project that makes sense for Britain and London, which is why this government is giving it our full on, flat out backing.

## Future sources of funding

As this audience will know, government grant funding for TfL - currently over £3bn a year - provides an important source of funding.

But in a world of constrained public sector resources we need to encourage other sources of investment too.

So we're working with Treasury colleagues to accelerate major infrastructure investment, looking at new ways to unlock new sources of capital, from international sovereign wealth funds to UK pension funds.

And we also want to enable the Mayor and TfL and London Boroughs to share in the profits of London's growth, giving them an even greater incentive to invest in business-friendly measures, a positive spiral for London.

Reforms to local government finance will see part of TfL's funding come from business rates in the capital, rather than traditional grant from central government.

This Business Rates Retention scheme, due to start in April 2013, will see London and other local authorities retain a share of the growth in business rates.

This is positive news for London.

It's also a real incentive for the GLA, the Mayor and the Boroughs to work with business to grow jobs and to grow prosperity.

## Removing barriers to investment

This government understands that a modern economy needs a modern transport system.

So, for us, the DfT is as much a Department for Growth as it is as a Department for Transport.

But we also recognise that, to get Britain moving you need to do more than invest in infrastructure and regeneration.

You also have to knock down the barriers that get in the way of growth and development.

So, we're also reforming our employment laws.

We're modernising our planning regulations.

And we're cutting corporation tax and getting rid of unnecessary regulations.

In other words, we're freeing up our risk takers and wealth creators by giving business the room to grow and the conditions to invest.

## Conclusion

In conclusion.

I've argued that, in large part, the prosperity of our Capital and our Country depends on the quality of our transport networks.

And I've set out some of the key steps we're taking to modernise those vital networks.

Now, when we came to office, faced with the state of the national finances we could have taken the easy option.

We could have adopted a slash and burn approach to transport investment.

After all, it's what governments have done in the past when the fiscal going got tough.

But just like the people in this audience we understand that there's a heavy price to pay when transport networks are clogged up, stretched to breaking point or past their best.

And, just like, you we know that cost is measured in lower growth and fewer jobs, now and in the future.

So, if there's just one message I'd like you to take away with you today, it is this - we have called time on worn out and run down transport infrastructure.

A government that's driving through programmes and projects, investments and innovations that will transform our transport links and our economic prospects.

A government that is engaging in constructive partnership with the dynamic potential of the private sector, as well as building on the strengths of the public sector.

Coming together to make a real and last difference.

Working together to keep London and Britain moving.

Thank you.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/mcloughlin-20121011a,National Transport Awards,"Speech by the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening Remarks

Many thanks for that introduction David (Prof David Begg, Transport Times).

And David, looking around tonight I can see that you're someone who knows how to put on a great show.

But you're also one of most recognised and respected voices in transport.

So, as well as thanking you and your colleagues for the hard work you've put into these impressive awards, I just wanted to express my personal gratitude for your contribution to transport down the years. Long may it continue.

I also want to say a big-thank you for asking me along to an event where I get to share the stage with Jeremy Vine.

Jeremy, it's great to be on the ""bill"" with you tonight. Although, having looked at your CV, I am starting to feel a bit like a serious under-achiever.

There's something important I want to say before anything else.

These awards remind us of the incredible job the people in the transport industry do.

So I just want you to know that this Transport Secretary and this Government recognise, value and appreciate everything you do.

While I have the chance I also wanted to say a very quick word about a subject the transport industry is very familiar with - and that's change.

I realise that changing ministers can be disruptive.

And I know that transport has had its fair share of changes under all governments.

Indeed, there are said to be more former transport secretaries alive than for any other Cabinet job.

So I want to say this:

I am serious about transport.

It's a job I wanted.

It's a job where there is much to do.

## West Coast Mainline

It's also a job where the challenges come thick and fast.

And, as Transport Secretary, I won't be hiding from any of them.

There will be setbacks as well as successes.

This month, when we hit one on the West Coast line, I came straight out and confronted it.

The mistakes made with the West Coast Mainline franchise bid were deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable.

So I've ordered two independent reviews.

The first will report back by the end of this month, the second by the end of the year.

This is a serious issue, and it's getting a serious response.

But let me be clear.

This is not about re-winding to a pre-privatisation past.

This is about learning lessons and moving forward with franchising so that future competitions are robust and deliver best value for passengers and tax payers.

And, while I'm on the subject of delivering value for money, there's another challenge I've faced up to since taking this job - and that's the cost of rail fares.

These are tough and testing times. And I want to help where I can.

So I'm pleased that I've been able to secure funds so that we can cut by 2% the planned increase in key rail fares. And not just for 2013, but for 2014 too.

## Coming home to the DfT

Now, although I may be the new boy at these awards, this isn't my first time at the Department for Transport.

I actually joined the Department in 1989, when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.

I started off as Roads Minister

Then I became the Minister responsible for Aviation and Maritime.

Mind you, seeing as I was afraid of flying, as well as the MP for the most landlocked constituency in the country, ""the Minister for Irony"" might have been a more suitable job title.

Well I'm still proud to represent that same constituency

But I'm pleased to tell you that I'm totally cured of my fear of flying.

Now of course a lot of things have changed in the years since then.

I've certainly got more grey hair.

And I've definitely put on a few pounds.

But one thing remains exactly the same - and that's the crucial importance of our transport links.

And that's why I'm proud to come home to the DfT.

## Introduce myself

I have to say that I'm really excited too.

Excited about the transport milestones the Government has already reached in the first half of this Parliament.

But also excited about our big plans and bold ambitions for the second half of the Parliament and beyond.

So, I could use today's speech to highlight our investment record - a Spending Review that committed £30 billion for transport projects right across the country.

I could explain how we're speeding up journeys and cutting congestion on the roads with innovations like managed motorways.

Or, I could focus on our plans to electrify more than 850 miles of rail track.

I could talk about all the things we're doing to devolve power and give local communities a real say about their transport.

Or I could tell you about our determination to build on Britain's summer of cycling success - encouraging more people to take to two wheels and building safety into our roads. As I said in Birmingham this week, it's something we need to act on.

I could even dedicate the entire speech to HS2.

A high speed rail network that isn't just about taking 20 minutes off the journey to Birmingham, but is actually about shaping and transforming Britain for the next two hundred years.

A network that has cross party support, as well this Government's full commitment.

A network that, like all big infrastructure projects in our history, starts off with controversy, but will end up being used and valued by everyone. Including the people who criticised it.

I could do all of that. But I won't.

Because, rather than talk about transport policy to an audience of transport policy experts, what I'd really like to do is introduce myself properly…

To tell you a little bit about my approach to this job and the principles that will guide me over the coming months and years.

## The Secretary of State for all of transport

I should also tell you that that I'm not in the business of favouring railways over roads or maritime over aviation.

So, as we get the money in and the schemes underway.

As we rebuild, renew and reform.

I will be the Secretary of State for all of transport.

## Reduce the hassle

The next thing you need to know about me is that I speak plainly. But I think big.

You won't catch me using jargon like ""calling points"" instead of stations.

I'm ambitious about transport because I'm ambitious for Britain.

Transport is the artery of any economy.

It gets people to work, children to school and food to the shops.

When transport slows, everything slows.

When transport stops, everything stops.

Everyone depends on transport every day.

So when people ask: ""what's your aim in the job?""

My answer is straightforward - my task is to reduce the hassle of getting around.

## Constructive co-operation, common ground

But I know that's not a one-person job.

So I want to engage and work with the transport industry.

And I could summarise my approach in two words - constructive co-operation.

Coming together and working together on common ground.

The common ground where we can find workable solutions to the big transport challenges out there.  
That's the approach I want to take.

Tonight is a celebration of your achievements and I know you're keen to get on with it.

So it's time I finished up. And as my wife always tells me - nobody will ever complain if a politician's speech is too short.

## The nominees

Before I conclude though, I just wanted to say something about the shortlist for this year's awards.

And, to do that, I'd like to look back to this summer's fantastic festival of sport, the 2012 London Games.

As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't just our Olympians and Paralympians who delivered the goods.

Because, this summer our transport networks and our transport industry were put to the test like never before.

And they were brilliant.

So you should all feel rightly proud.

As indeed should tonight's nominees.

Tonight's short-list ranges from small local initiatives to big national projects.

And from teams who developed innovations in transport technology…to individuals who radically improved customer service.

Every nominee is different.

But, having seen that short-list, I know that you all share something in common - excellence.

## Concluding remarks

Some people wonder all their lives if they make a difference.

Well, that's not a problem for tonight's nominees, or indeed for anyone working in this country's transport industry.

Because in making a difference to transport you are making a difference to Britain.

That's why it's an honour to share this special evening with you.

That's why it's great to be back at the DfT.

And that's why I'm looking forward to working with all of you.

And on that note it just remains for me to thank-you for listening and to wish good luck to everyone who's waiting nervously to hear if they've won an award.

Thank you very much and have a great night.",transcript,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-sure-uk-airports-and-airlines-are-safe-secure-and-competitive-while-reducing-their-impacts-on-the-environment-and-communities,patrick-mcloughlin,,department-for-transport,11-Oct-2012,2012-10-11
new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120911a,Fuel Quality Directive Transposition,Written statement by Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker).,"Today I am publishing our response to the comments received in the [consultation on our proposals to implement Articles 7a to 7e of the EU Fuel Quality Directive (Directive 98/70/EC as amended by Directive 2009/30/EC)](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-04/). The Directive requires suppliers to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity of many transport fuels.

The response sets out our decision to introduce new secondary legislation to transpose requirements of the Fuel Quality Directive, including new annual reporting requirements for fossil fuels and biofuels.

The document also details our commitment to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (""RTFO Order 2007"") to include fuels used in non-road mobile machinery, a policy already announced to the House on July 16 when the Department published a related consultation response (Official report, 16 July 2012, Column 112WS).

An amendment made in December 2011 to the RTFO Order 2007 means that only biofuels meeting minimum sustainability criteria count towards renewable energy targets. Sustainable biofuels play an important role in our efforts to tackle climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. However, concerns remain about the sustainability of some biofuels, especially around the issue of indirect land use change (""ILUC"") and we are pressing the European Commission and other Member States to produce a robust method to address this issue. Pending that clarity we are taking a cautious approach to implementing the Fuel Quality Directive.

The Fuel Quality Directive introduces the requirement for many transport fuel suppliers to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuels they supply by 6% in 2020. We will not impose on suppliers a greenhouse gas reduction obligation at this point. Instead, we will place an ongoing legal duty on the Secretary of State to propose any further measures necessary to ensure delivery of the requirements of the Fuel Quality Directive. We will rely on the amended RTFO Order 2007 to deliver the greenhouse gas savings necessary under the Fuel Quality Directive for the period up to 2014. We will also put in place a requirement for fuel suppliers to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of both the biofuel and fossil fuels they supply for use in land-based transport and for the associated uses listed in the Directive.

This approach allows us to transpose the Fuel Quality Directive at the minimum cost to UK business.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120917a,Railway Stations,Written statement by Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker).,"I would like to inform the House of the [decision that has been made in relation to London Midland's application to change Schedule 17 of the Ticketing and Settlement Agreement (TSA)](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/london-midland-ticket-office-opening-hours-decision), which was referred to the Department for Transport for arbitration.

The TSA sets out the various arrangements between train operators relating to the carriage of passengers and the retailing of tickets. London Midland's proposal was to change the minimum opening hours of a number of ticket offices, including the closure of nine offices altogether. These changes would not affect the level of train services in any way.

I have decided to approve London Midland's proposal in part, but reject some elements where the case for changes has not been made. Ticket offices at Small Heath, Jewellery Quarter, Bescot Stadium, Duddeston and Adderley Park, which were proposed for closure, will remain open. However, I have agreed four of the nine proposed ticket office closures, at Wythall, Witton, Lye and Cheddington.

Several ticket offices will have their opening hours extended, while a number of other stations will have their ticket office opening hours reduced. A full list of the changes has been published on the Department's website.

In arbitrating this decision, we were careful to ensure that the proposal was in line with the criteria set out in the TSA, whereby passengers continue to enjoy widespread and easy access to the purchase of rail products, and that the proposal represents an improvement in terms of quality of service and/or cost-effectiveness.

I have also ensured that no particular group of rail users is affected disproportionately by the changes, particularly passengers with disabilities.

The changes reflect the change in the way passengers are buying tickets, with more choosing to purchase their tickets online or at ticket vending machines, and the changes that have been approved will not generally affect stations during periods in which the ticket office is currently selling more than 12 tickets an hour.

As a condition of the changes, London Midland will also be required to provide a total of 29 additional ticket vending machines at stations that do not currently have this facility. This will be an improvement in availability at stations where the ticket office is currently only open part-time, with passengers in future able to purchase tickets whenever they wish to travel.

We have also ensured that London Midland will keep lifts in operation when stations are unstaffed. LM will also improve safety and security at stations, including through the provision of upgraded CCTV at 11 stations and will provide additional shelters and upgraded signage as a condition of this approval.

In addition, London Midland will invest in 30 new train boarding ramps to improve access to trains for wheelchair users. Passengers who require assistance in making their journey can now book this via the new industry website, which was launched by the Association of Train Operating Companies on 24 August.

There are currently many ticket offices open for very long hours, while selling very few tickets indeed. In an era where passengers are telling us that they need fares to come down and investment in services to rise, these sorts of costs simply cannot be justified.

These changes will provide savings to taxpayers and passengers far beyond the life of the existing franchise, and will ultimately save millions of pounds. I believe that this is a necessary step in improving the efficiency of the rail network, and reducing the cost of rail travel for everyone.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120918a,Devolving Local Major Transport Schemes: next step,"Written statement by Norman Baker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","Earlier this year we launched a consultation paper setting out options for how we should devolve funding and prioritisation of local major transport schemes following this Spending Review period.

Transport is vitally important to local economies, and new infrastructure can provide the missing links that are often so crucial in getting economies moving and creating opportunities for new investment and employment.

We want to ensure that decisions on new transport infrastructure are made more efficiently, and at a more local level than previously. Local Enterprise Partnerships are well placed to understand how transport investment can be used to boost economic recovery and growth and that is why we want them, working with Local Authorities, to have a key role. Indeed more Government funding was announced yesterday for Local Enterprise Partnerships to boost their ability to contribute to the growth and jobs agenda.

I am pleased to say that our consultation proposals were met with approval from the majority of respondents, particularly Local Authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships. A summary of the responses received was published in July. I have today published firm proposals, confirming that, in all of the key areas, the Department will proceed on the basis as set out in the consultation paper.

I fully support the key objective of removing Whitehall from the process of making decisions on which local schemes should or should not go ahead. However we have a responsibility to ensure that the new local decision makers have arrangements in place to achieve the value for money that we know the right schemes can deliver and to take account of other important factors such as environmental impact. Most respondents accepted the need for robust local assurance frameworks and we will shortly publish detailed guidance on this, to enable local areas to submit their draft frameworks by December.

Transparency is also essential, to ensure that priorities are widely publicised and understood and can be effectively shaped by local people that have a key interest in them. Evaluation will also assume an even greater importance, to enable all parties to look critically at whether key outcomes were achieved and to learn lessons for future investment decisions.

We have asked local areas to confirm the geographical basis for their local transport bodies by 28 September. When they have done so I will set out indicative funding levels that each area should use as a planning assumption. I can confirm that the distribution of funding between different areas will be on a simple per-capita basis. The total level of funding available will of course be subject to decisions made in future spending rounds.

I look forward to working with local transport bodies over the coming months as we embark on this transition to a truly decentralised system and they begin developing their infrastructure plans for post 2015.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120918b,High Speed Rail: Phase 1 Consultation Update,"Written statement by Norman Baker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","The Government's decision on 10th January 2012 to take forward proposals for a national high speed rail network followed a major public consultation exercise that attracted around 55,000 responses.

The decision to proceed took account of a range of evidence including analysis by my Department and High Speed Two Ltd of issues raised in consultation as well as comments from a wide variety of interested parties through a range of engagement approaches. The Government's independent response analysis consultants, Dialogue by Design (DbyD), carried out a detailed analysis of the consultation responses and a summary of their analysis was published alongside the Government's January decision, with an addendum report published in July:

  * High Speed Rail: [Investing in Britain's Future - Consultation Summary Report](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-consultation-summary/)
  * High Speed Rail: [Investing in Britain's Future - Addendum](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/high-speed-rail-addendum/)

Since publishing the Addendum report in July, it has become apparent that a further very small proportion of responses were not fully analysed by DbyD. For these responses, the answers to one or more of the seven consultation questions were omitted from DbyD's analysis. In total, approximately 0.4% of answers provided to individual consultation questions were affected.

The table below shows how many of the seven consultation answers were omitted from the analysis in each case:

The cause has been identified as technical errors in transferring data captured from online consultation responses to the consultation analysis database held by DbyD.

My Department asked for supplementary analysis from DbyD and this work concludes that the responses 'do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report'. Inclusion in the original analysis would not have changed the substance of DbyD's findings, nor affected the considerations which informed the decisions following the consultation.

All those who submitted the responses affected will be contacted with details of their particular cases.

This interim response is considering only option 1 of the consultation. The remaining options and consultation responses will be considered and a full response, including proposals for a way forward, will be published by the end of November.  
The foundation of all three of the main policy options is a speeding up of the process by allowing stopping up and planning applications to run concurrently, namely option 1.

The large majority of respondents, comprising three main groups, namely developers, local authorities and those affected by stopping up decisions, gave broad support for allowing stopping up and planning applications to be made concurrently, with agreement that it would speed up the process and reduce burdens. We will seek an early legislative opportunity to implement this change.

The Government committed to improving the stopping up application process in the 2011 Autumn Statement and this will help to deliver the Government's growth agenda, by removing unnecessary burdens faced by businesses, speeding up the application process and removing unnecessary bureaucracy. The change will play a useful role in encouraging investment and therefore growth in local communities.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20121023a,HGV Road User Levy,"Written statement by Stephen Hammond, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport.","For the benefit of Members of the House, I am today setting out some details of the HGV Road User Levy Bill which will be debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday 23rd October. The Bill itself will be walked in after the debate on the Ways and Means resolution.

The HGV Road User Levy Bill with introduce charges for all HGVs that weigh 12 tonnes and over for using the UK road network.

The Government realises the importance of haulage services provided by both UK-registered and foreign-registered vehicles to our economy, ensuring that goods are brought in and efficiently moved around the country. The key aim of this Bill is to ensure a fairer arrangement for UK-hauliers to help improve their competitiveness.

The legislation being introduced fulfils a commitment in the Coalition Agreement and is designed to remove an inequality, whereby UK hauliers pay to use many roads abroad, but foreign-hauliers do not pay to use roads in the UK. The levy is designed to be cost neutral for UK hauliers, through offsetting reductions in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) payments. Changes to VED will be included in the Finance Bill 2014.

The levy will be time based and will vary according to the vehicle type, weight and number of axles. This seeks to ensure that the charging scale is linked to the amount of damage a HGV causes to a road. The levy will be a maximum of £1,000 per year or £10 per day for the largest vehicles.

UK-registered HGVs will pay the levy for either a six-monthly or annual period. Foreign-registered vehicles can pay the levy either daily, weekly, monthly or annually. Rebates will be available under certain circumstances. Revenues will be paid into the Consolidated Fund.

The Bill makes it an offence to fail to pay the levy and, on summary conviction, a fine of up to level 5 on the standard scale (currently £5,000) will be payable. The Bill also provides for the offence to be subject to a fixed penalty and it allows the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a vehicle licence if he is not satisfied that the appropriate levy has been paid.

The scheme will be administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) or the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland. A private company will be contracted by the Department for Transport to administer the payment scheme for foreign-registered HGVs. The contractor will be required to maintain an electronic database of foreign-registered HGVs for which a levy has been paid. UK enforcement agencies will have access to the database.

The scheme will be enforced by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) in Great Britain and the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland. These agencies currently enforce UK and foreign hauliers' compliance with regulations on vehicle roadworthiness, drivers' hours and other road safety regulations. The Police also have enforcement powers.

The Department for Transport conducted a consultation exercise in early 2012, and the findings of this are also being published today, and will be available on the [Department for Transport's website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-03).",written-statement,providing-effective-regulation-of-freight-transport,,stephen-hammond,,department-for-transport,23-Oct-2012,2012-10-23
new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20121030a,HGV Road User Levy Bill,"Written statement by Stephen Hammond, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport.","I am today correcting the answer to a question that I provided during the Ways and Means Resolution debate on the HGV Road User Levy Bill, on Tuesday 23rd October 2012.

In response to the question asked by Bob Stewart (Beckenham) (Con) on ""whether vehicles leaving a port of entry will have a physical sign on their windows indicating that they have paid"" [Official Report, 23 October 2012, Col 881], I should have clearly stated that there will be no physical sign of payment, through the display of a paper disc, sticker or similar item.

Payment of the levy will be recorded in a database using the vehicle registration as the unique identifier. We expect that enforcement of non payment will be carried out using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology equipped cameras linked to this payment database, which will allow VOSA to target and stop non-compliant vehicles. We expect that checks on vehicles will be made shortly after the HGVs have left the port at which they have arrived, and are on the UK road network. Further checks will be carried out in other locations. Non-compliant vehicles will need to pay a penalty of £200 before they are allowed to proceed. Cases that are taken to court will be liable to a fine of up to £5,000.

The use of a physical indication of payment is impractical, as drivers could have to physically change stickers or discs daily, and it would create an enormous and costly burden, in terms of administration of the charge. It could also create problems if relied on for enforcement, as stickers or discs could be forged.

The Department for Transport's consultation on this subject was also based on a database linked enforcement method.",written-statement,providing-effective-regulation-of-freight-transport,,stephen-hammond,,department-for-transport,31-Oct-2012,2012-10-31

I immediately ordered two independent investigations to be undertaken urgently. The first, led by Sam Laidlaw, who is the Chief Executive of Centrica, lead non-executive on procurement across the government, and lead non-executive member of the Departmental Board is examining what happened during the West Coast procurement and why, with the aim of establishing the lessons to be learned. The second review, led by Richard Brown, Chairman of Eurostar, is focussing on any lessons to be learned for the upcoming franchising programme.

I also announced, that the ongoing franchising programme should be paused, pending the outcome of the two investigations. This included pausing the live competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western and Thameslink.

This morning at 7am, I have made a further announcement to the London Stock Exchange, that the Department for Transport is commencing negotiations with Virgin Rail Group with a view to them remaining as operator of passenger services for the West Coast Main Line for a short period, of around 9 to 13 months while we run a competition for an interim franchise agreement. This interim agreement, which would be open to any bidders, will then run until a new long term West Coast franchise is ready to commence.

I shall update the House further, later today.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121015b,West Coast Main Line,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","Mr Speaker, with permission I would like to make a statement on the West Coast Main Line.

On Wednesday 3rd October I announced the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise procurement.

This decision was taken as the result of significant flaws found within the procurement process undertaken by my Department.

These made the continuation of the competition and the award of the franchise untenable.

I know how important the West Coast Main Line is to the economy of this country and to the constituents of Members.

This franchise operates over 300 train services a day, carries over 26 million passengers a year and employs more than 3000 staff.

Mr Speaker, this is a regrettable outcome caused by unacceptable mistakes made by officials in my Department during a complex procurement process.

It has also meant that I have paused the ongoing franchising programme, including live competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western, and Thameslink.

I would like to reiterate that there is no suggestion that First Group or any of the other bidders including Virgin Trains acted in anything other than good faith during the bidding process.

First Group is a great British company and a leading transport operator both here and in the United States.

It provides jobs for 13,000 people across the UK and operates four railway franchises, which together carry over 300 million passengers a year.

I want to make it clear today that the cancellation of the West Coast competition should not be seen as a comment on FirstGroup, its bid, or its approach to running rail franchises now or in the future.

Furthermore, as I have said to the Transport Select Committee, Virgin has also made a fantastic contribution to both the railways and aviation in this country.

It would be premature at this stage to speculate on where and how the errors in the process emerged.

That is why, when I announced the cancellation of the procurement, I also asked for two urgent investigations to be carried out.

Both reviews are now well underway.

The first of these is an inquiry led by Sam Laidlaw, the Chief Executive of Centrica. He is the lead non-executive director on procurement across Government and the lead non-executive director of the Departmental board. 

His review is examining what happened during the West Coast procurement and why. It will establish the lessons to be learned.

I have asked for the initial findings of the review by the end of October and expect the full report by the end of November.

The second review is looking at the implications of the flaws on the West Coast procurement for the rest of the franchising programme.

This review is being led by Richard Brown, a highly-respected industry figure and the Chairman of Eurostar.

My expectation is that the Brown review will report no later than the end of the year on lessons for the future franchising programme - so that it can be resumed as soon as possible.

Mr Speaker, I am today publishing the terms of reference for both reviews, and these have already been laid in the Library of the House.

Before these reviews have been completed, and particularly before the findings of the Laidlaw review have been published, any speculation as to the nature of the flaws is just that - speculation.

I will of course report to the House on the findings of these reviews at the earliest opportunity.

However, I would like to take this opportunity to restate the Government's commitment to ensuring that we continue to have private sector innovation and investment in the railways.

Since privatisation, the number of passenger miles travelled has nearly doubled.

This growth brings significant benefits to the country's economy and to the environment, relieving congestion, improving connectivity for businesses, commuters and leisure travellers.

Passenger satisfaction is up. So is punctuality.

I want to see these benefits continue. That is why I want this pause while the reviews are carried out to be as short as possible.

We will restart our refranchising programme - including the competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western, and Thameslink as soon as possible.

Mr Speaker, I would now like to turn to the future operation of the West Coast Main Line.

I am committed to ensuring that passengers will see no impact as a result of these mistakes.

Passengers will be able to make the journeys they have planned, with the tickets they have bought.

Clearly we will need to learn lessons from the two reviews. And we will need to run a new competition for the West Coast franchise.

I want this to happen as quickly as possible, but we want to get it right which will take time.

It is also important that in the intervening period we secure a deal which secures best value for the taxpayer, including, continuing improvement in service quality.

For this reason, I am today announcing that we are commencing negotiations with Virgin Rail Group with a view to them remaining as operator of passenger services for the West Coast Main Line.

Subject to ensuring value for money for the taxpayer, I expect this to last for a short period of around 9 to 13 months.

In this period we will run a competition for an interim agreement. This interim agreement, which would be open to any bidders, will then run until the new long-term West Coast franchise is ready to commence.

I will keep this approach under review so it can be informed by Richard Brown's findings and recommendations, and so it ensures value for money.

Mr Speaker, I am grateful to the team at Directly Operated Railways for all their preparation so far. Directly Operated Railways will continue to stand ready should they be required.

Britain's railways are a great success and I am determined that this incident does not get in the way of this Government's real record.

We have launched the biggest programme of investment since the Victorian era. We have also just announced reductions in regulated fares rises over the next two years, recognising the importance of access to the railways for millions of commuters.

And we are pressing ahead with the most ambitious and visionary infrastructure agenda in recent years - most notably in pursuing the transformative programme for High Speed 2.

I commend this statement to the House.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121025a,High Speed Two - Assistance and compensation for home owners and occupiers on the London - West Midlands Route,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","In January the government announced that we would proceed with plans to build a high speed rail network linking London with Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. High Speed Two (HS2) will have a transformative effect on Britain, bringing cities closer together and providing the new transport capacity we need to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

We need to drive forward with this vital national project. In doing so we need to provide support for those facing the disruption that the plans for the railway are causing, while also protecting the interests of tax-payers who will ultimately pay for compensation. We have been clear throughout that we are committed to providing appropriate compensation and assistance for those affected by the building of HS2.

The statutory system of compensation already provides fair compensation for the vast majority of infrastructure schemes. However, given the particular circumstances of HS2, in this case I believe it is right to go above and beyond what is required by law. Today I am launching a generous proposed compensation and support package for public consultation.

Under the proposals set out today all those living closest to the route of HS2, in the so-called 'safeguarded area', will be able to choose to sell their home to the government - whether it is required for construction or not - at any time after the HS2 route is safeguarded, which is currently expected to happen in Spring 2013. Those choosing to sell their homes will receive its full un-blighted value (that is, what the property would have been worth had there been no plans for HS2), a home loss payment of 10% of the value of the property (up to a maximum of £47,000) and be reimbursed for reasonable moving costs, including stamp duty on the purchase of a new property of equivalent value.

In rural areas we will establish a 'voluntary purchase zone', extending out from the boundary of the safeguarded area up to 120m either side of the line, within which homeowners will have the option to sell their homes to the government at their full unblighted value at any time after the HS2 route is safeguarded.

For those living beyond both the safeguarded area and voluntary purchase zone but who need to move house during the development of HS2 and find they are unable to sell their property, there will also be a 'long term hardship scheme' under which the government will buy the homes of successful applicants at their full unblighted value.

In addition, under the new 'sale and rent' back scheme, homeowners whose property will need to be acquired will have the option to sell their homes to the government early and stay in them as tenants until the properties are required for the railway.

We recognise that the owners of properties above tunnels may also be concerned about the potential impact of HS2 and therefore we are bringing in a series of measures designed to provide confidence in these properties.

Finally, we will work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to agree a joint strategy to replace any social housing which is lost.

I must stress that we have already written directly to all those whose homes we currently expect to need to buy in order to build and operate HS2 on the London - West Midlands route. The wide-ranging proposals set out today reflect the significant nature of the concern that currently exists in the property markets near the HS2 line of route, they are not a reflection of what the government believes the long term impacts of HS2 will be. We fully expect that the impacts of HS2 will be considerably less than feared and that property prices will recover over time. However, we recognise that the current property markets near the HS2 line of route may not reflect this.

HS2 will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century, offering the new railway capacity that our country will need to compete and grow. However, we fully recognise that the line will have unwelcome impacts on people living close to the route and I believe that this package of compensation demonstrates the strength of the government's commitment to provide the right compensation and assistance to those affected.

Alongside the property consultation published today, we are also publishing a consultation on safeguarding directions for HS2. This will set out the proposed area of land considered necessary to protect the line of route from conflicting developments, that is to say planning permission being granted for developments on land that will be required for the construction or operation of HS2. This will also set the 'safeguarded area' within which compensation measures will apply.

Both consultations will close on 31st January 2013.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121025b,EU Transport Council 29 October 2012,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","I will attend the first Transport Council of the Cypriot Presidency (the Presidency) in Luxembourg on Monday 29 October.

The Presidency hopes to achieve General Approach on three proposals:

  * The first is a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the allocation of slots, repealing Council Directive 95/93/EC. The proposed regulation has been subject to intense official-level scrutiny by Council Working Groups and these discussions are ongoing. Progress to date has been mixed, but the proposition remains acceptable from a UK perspective. I believe that the resulting regulation could help promote the most effective use of airport slots and build on the existing transparent, market-based approach to encourage the more efficient use of scarce capacity at congested airports, while minimising administrative and financial burdens for industry. However, at this stage, it remains unclear whether or not it will be possible to seek a General Approach at the October Council.
  * The second is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the enforcement of certain provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention by flag States. The proposed General Approach represents a satisfactory outcome for the UK and I will support it as it allows appropriate flexibility to Member States, and will not require the UK to make any substantive changes to its proposed implementation of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention on flag State responsibilities.
  * The third is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2009/16/EC on port State control. I will support the proposal which will not require the UK to make any substantive changes to its proposed implementation of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention on port State responsibilities.

An orientation debate will be held on a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roadworthiness testing for motor vehicles and their trailers (First Reading). The UK strongly supports the ongoing roadworthiness testing of vehicles as a worthwhile contribution to road safety.

However, the UK is very concerned by the potential cost burden of the European Commission's proposal as it is currently framed. The UK alone has identified costs of over €1 billion without any discernable benefit in road safety. We have also identified significant administrative burdens embedded in the proposal that similarly would produce no road safety benefit. In the current economic climate the UK does not wish to see any additional cost to European citizens, businesses or governments unless clearly justified by road safety benefits.

The Presidency will be seeking a Political Agreement on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council (First Reading). The UK supports the proposal which strikes a sensible balance between improving the security of the tachograph whilst ensuring that additional burdens on industry and enforcement authorities are minimised.

The Council will be expected to adopt a proposal for a Council decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement providing a general framework for enhanced cooperation between the European Union and the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol). The UK supports the proposed Agreement. It is important that the significant work Eurocontrol performs on behalf of the European Union is put on a sound contractual and financial basis to help ensure value for money from the proposed €40 million expenditure over four years.",written-statement,making-sure-uk-airports-and-airlines-are-safe-secure-and-competitive-while-reducing-their-impacts-on-the-environment-and-communities,sustaining-a-thriving-maritime-sector,patrick-mcloughlin,,department-for-transport,25-Oct-2012,2012-10-25
new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121029a,Statement on West Coast Main Line and franchising,"Oral statement by the the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin, Secretary of State for Transport.","Mr Speaker, with permission I would like to make a statement on the progress we are making to put right arrangements for the West Coast Main Line and rail franchising.

First, I will update the House on the Laidlaw Inquiry.

Second, I will explain how we will ensure not only continuity of service on the West Coast line after December 9th but an enhanced service.

On the 3rd of October I announced the cancellation of the competition to run the Inter-City West Coast franchise…

…because of the discovery of unacceptable flaws in the procurement process run by the Department for Transport.

I made it clear at the time, and do so again today, that this was a very regrettable decision prompted by mistakes that should never have happened.

I also launched two independent inquiries, one of which has reported its [interim findings](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/laidlaw-inquiry-interim-report) to me and which I am today delivering to the House.

I asked the first inquiry, led by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw, to look into what happened and why…

…with the aim of establishing the lessons to be learned.

I also asked the second review, led by Eurostar chairman Richard Brown, to focus on any lessons to be learned for the future rail franchising programme.

I promised that both would conduct their investigations thoroughly, independently and urgently.

Mr Speaker, given the public interest in this matter the Laidlaw Inquiry was asked to deliver an interim report to me by the 26th October, and a final report by the end of November.

I am grateful to the Inquiry for meeting this first deadline, and working tirelessly to meet the second.

I stress that today's findings are precisely that - an interim report. There is more work to do. These findings are clearly a first stage.

As Mr Laidlaw explains, they set out what went wrong, and from that basis he will now carry out further investigations into why this happened.

From the start, my aim in dealing with this situation has been to be open, and come forward with information for the House at the earliest opportunity.

It is in that spirit that I make this statement today.

In the interests of complete transparency, I am publishing this interim report, with its provisional findings, and placing copies of it in the Libraries of both Houses.

To be blunt, these initial findings make uncomfortable reading but they provide a necessary and welcome further step in sorting this out.

The Government will need to see the full and finished report before it can comment in detail on any conclusions.

This is crucial because of the independent nature of the Laidlaw Inquiry and the need for the Government not to pre-judge its eventual findings.

But it is clear that the Inquiry has identified a number of issues which confirm that my decision to cancel the franchise competition was necessary.

These include…

…a lack of transparency in the bidding process…

…the fact that published guidance was not complied with when bids were being processed…

…inconsistencies in the treatment of bidders…

…and confirmation of technical flaws in the model used to calculate the amount of risk capital bidders were asked to provide to guard against the risk of default.

The Laidlaw Inquiry also mentions factors ""that appear to have caused or contributed to the issues raised"".

We will look at these with interest and care, although once again we will need to see the final report before we can comment further.

Secondly, I would like to update the House on the progress we are making to ensure continuity of service on the West Coast Main Line once the current franchise expires on the 9th of December.

As I have said previously, we will ensure that passengers continue to be served by the same trains, with the same frontline staff, the same services, using the same tickets…

…and, I am pleased to say, enhanced future timetables.

The Department is making good progress in its discussions with Virgin on how they will operate the line for a short period of up to 14 months while a competition is run for an interim agreement.

We are discussing their proposals for improved services over this period and an enhanced compensation scheme for delayed passengers.

In dealing with this, my Department has been frank and open about its mistakes and is absolutely determined to find out exactly what happened.

In the meantime, we will keep delivering for passengers and continue with the unprecedented levels of investment in trains, stations and railway lines.

Combined with our decision to limit train fare rises to an average of inflation plus one per cent, instead of RPI+3, for the next three years…

…this demonstrates this government's total commitment to Britain's railways.

I commend this statement to the House.",oral-statement,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,patrick-mcloughlin,,department-for-transport,29-Oct-2012,2012-10-29

[Cold Comfort Conference keynote address](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2Ryqw-leSU#t=0s)

Good afternoon

Thank you for once again inviting me to give the keynote address on the opening day of the 21st annual Surveyor Winter Conference and Exhibition.

My apologies that I am unable to be in Coventry in person to give this speech. 

Like all of you at this two day Conference, I take the issue of winter preparations very seriously indeed. Whilst I am pleased to say that last winter's weather was not as severe as in previous years, all parts of the country did naturally still experience spells of snow, freezing rain and below average temperatures. 

As we all know, our weather can be unpredictable and I recall hearing of a cricket match in Derbyshire having play stopped in June due to snow. So it is vital that we do not become complacent and as transport operators we all have robust contingency plans in place to deal with any eventuality.

It is essential that we do everything possible to keep our transport infrastructure - both strategic and local roads, rail network, as well as our airports and port facilities - operating as efficiently and safely as possible.

If we don't there is personal inconvenience. But there is also a wider economic impact. The Report that we published in December last year highlighted that the total cost of delayed journeys to both businesses and individuals due to snow was estimated to be around £280m a day in England alone.

That is why it is important that we continue to build on the recommendations arising from the Quarmby Winter Resilience Report and Audit and the Transport Select Committee report following an Inquiry they undertook in 2011, to ensure that we continue to be in a resilient position as we head into this winter.

We at the Department for Transport are determined to stay ahead of the game.

We continue to work closely with the Met Office to make sure that we have the best advice available to prepare for severe winter weather. 

I note that you will be hearing from Dr Adam Scaife from the Met Office tomorrow afternoon in respect of weather forecasting. I was pleased to see that the Met Office have taken steps to improve their service and last year launched improvements to the National Severe Weather Service which allows more targeted forecasting of potential impacts from severe weather.

We continue to maintain a substantial national strategic salt reserve and have a robust distribution process in place, if for any reason this salt of last resort needs to be allocated.

The findings of the recent salt audit undertaken by the Department suggests local highway authorities will enter the winter with a healthy supply. 

Authorities continue to place orders with domestic salt suppliers and are receiving stocks. This demonstrates that the supply chain is also in a much better position than a few years ago.

The Department will, as in previous years, continue to monitor salt stocks that are held by authorities across the country, as well as the Highways Agency, on a monthly basis. 

It is vital that authorities continue to help us with this activity so we can ensure the country continues to have a good level of resilience. Your co-operation in this is very much appreciated.

Finally, my officials are currently updating the Strategic Salt Protocol Note that we published on the Department's website last year. This note sets out the arrangements for the allocation of strategic salt, if and when required, including the price of salt per tonne. I hope that we will be in a position to publish an updated Note in early October. 

Of course salt is just one issue in ensuring we keep disruption on the transport network to a minimum in the event of severe winter weather, and it is worth highlighting briefly what other modes are also doing to ensure that we enter winter well prepared.

The Highways Agency is currently finalising preparations for its winter driving campaign - 'Make time for winter' - which will commence on 29 October 2012. 

This year the messages will place emphasis on drivers taking more responsibility for their own actions based around two key themes, 'Be prepared' and 'Be informed'.

The purpose of the campaign is to alert drivers to the steps they should take, such as ensuring their vehicles are roadworthy, that they have emergency travel kits in their vehicles, that they drive sensibly and take precautions while travelling, and make use of weather-related traffic and travel information (both before and during their journeys) to make informed decisions - about whether to travel at all.

This year the Highways Agency will continue to work with the freight industry and its campaign messages will be shared with partners and stakeholders including the Road Haulage Association, Freight Transport Association and other independent contractors to assist HGV drivers and freight organisations in preparing for driving in winter. 

This year's winter campaign messages will also feature at ports and truckstops including a range of posters translated into several European languages including, Spanish, French, Polish, German and Italian.

Following our experiences over the last three winters the Agency has a good story to tell. They now have a fleet of more than 500 winter vehicles for treating motorways and major 'A' roads around the clock to help keep the strategic network open under all but the most extreme of circumstances. 

However, when sudden spells of very severe weather coincide with periods of heavy traffic, it is not always possible to prevent congestion and delays, as our winter service vehicles need space to treat the roads quickly and effectively. 

Therefore it's vital that road users - HGV and car drivers alike - give the Agency fleet and their contractors the space to do their jobs following bouts of severe weather. 

On the rail network I am also pleased to say that Train Operating Companies and Network Rail have taken steps to learn lessons from the severe weather in previous winters and apply them in preparing for this one. 

Let me give you just a couple of examples - although I also am aware that you will be hearing from Tony Jackson from Network Rail tomorrow.

Network Rail has Key Route Strategies, which set out arrangements for keeping lines and critical junctions open. On the routes which are electrified with a 'third rail', principally those south of the River Thames in South East England, Network Rail has introduced heating of the conductor rail in critical locations, which will keep it clear of snow and ice.

Network Rail has also introduced improved snow and ice clearance trains, including a snow plough and equipment to keep the conductor rail clear of ice and snow. In some locations, extra point heaters have been installed to ensure that points remain operational during freezing weather and maintenance has been carried out on existing point heaters to ensure their reliability. 

Train Operating Companies have also undertaken maintenance work on their train fleets to ensure reliability during winter operation. This has included actions to minimise problems with frozen sliding doors and frozen couplings. Some fleets on the 'third rail' network have been equipped to spray de-icing fluid in order to keep the conductor rail clear of ice and snow. 

Contingency timetables have also been produced which can be introduced in the event of severe winter weather. These have been validated by Network Rail to ensure that they are capable of being operated robustly. Improvements in timetabling software mean that these can be uploaded to industry journey planning systems overnight, which will allow passengers to have an accurate picture of the level of service being operated.

I am also pleased to say that changes have been made to passenger information systems at stations to improve the accuracy and timeliness of information available to passengers when services are disrupted. These improvements worked very well last year. In addition, some Train Operating Companies are now using social media such as Twitter to disseminate information to passengers in real time. 

I am also pleased that following the disruption to air services at UK airports during the winters of 2009 and 2010, the aviation industry has also taken significant steps to improve its resilience to severe winter weather.

The busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, have made significant investments in additional snow and ice clearance capacity. For example, Heathrow has tripled its clearance vehicle fleet and quadrupled staff numbers available for snow clearance.

Both these airports, and indeed others, have revised their operational command and control procedures to improve their response to severe weather, including working in closer co-operation with airlines and other transport providers.

In addition, websites and social media provided updated flight information to ensure that passengers could fly with the minimum amount of disruption. For those passengers who were unfortunate to have a flight cancelled, the airport and airline operators had robust plans in place to inform those passengers in advance so they could make alternative arrangements or arrive at the airport at a later time.

Last but not least, we all know the importance to the UK economy of ensuring that our port operations remain open during the any severe winter weather event. My officials are working closely with port operators to ensure they build on lessons learnt from previous years and have the right winter management plans in place.

I appreciate the significant efforts that have already been made this year across all transport modes to boost our resilience and preparedness for possible severe winter weather and I hope that any disruption that may occur is kept to a minimum due to the plans that are in place to ensure that the transport system recovers as quickly as possible.

However we must not become complacent. We all should remain alert to ensure that we can tackle any severe winter weather that we may encounter this winter season.

Thank you.

[Electric vehicle event speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlP0rXy81Q)

I am sorry not to be able to be with you today at Adastral Park - but delighted to be able to join you in your Electric Vehicle event today - by video - and offer my support.

I understand that Adastral Park has always been a pretty cutting edge sort of place with a [stellar] name to reflect its history of experimentation and innovation - in aeronautics first off[1], and then as home for British Telecom's global innovation and development centre.

In a way, it is emblematic of the kind of advance that is being made now with plug in vehicles - with new models coming to market and an ever-widening network of charge points around the country.

The Source East team have made impressive progress, with partners in the public and private sector, to get this bedded in around the East of England.

BT charge points are a welcome addition to the network. So too will be Hutchison Ports' new points at Felixstowe that go into service today - connecting UK's largest container port to the Plugged In vehicle network.

Access to workplace charge points helps to build the case for people moving to the Electric Vehicle option and I fully expect that your lead will encourage other companies to follow.

You have got a number of electric vehicles on site today. I hope everyone who wants to gets the chance to test them out and feel how they drive.

Another welcome development is Source East and green energy UK's announcement of their new partnership - which gives Source East members access to discounted green energy for home charging over night.

For many Electric Vehicle drivers, that is going to be the routine - delivering major savings on running costs and freedom from fuel forecourt queuing.

This is a time of innovation and ground-breaking technology development - much of it happening here in the UK.

It is giving motorists great new driving opportunities - which will as well help put a significant dent in our carbon emissions and create new opportunities for economic growth.

The Coalition Government is four square behind this. We have made a £400 million commitment, among other things to support grants for plug in cars and plug in vans and to provide funding for Plugged In Places like Source East.

I hope you have a very good day and make the most of testing out the new kit.

I am sorry not to be able to be present at your conference today - but delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words to open this afternoon's session - focused as it is on the challenge of transport in an urban environment.

For me, the theme chimes in very closely with the work that I have been pushing forward while I have been in Government.

In a nutshell - developing a transport system that creates growth - and cuts emissions. Especially carbon emissions. 

Clearly how we get around in the future - whether in cities or elsewhere - will have a huge impact on how we achieve these aims.

Around a quarter of UK domestic carbon emissions are from transport - and over 90 per cent of those are from road traffic.M

It's worth pointing out, as did last month's UK Climate Change Committee report, the good progress being made in reducing emissions from new cars.

A 4.2% reduction between 2010 and 2011, and on track to meet the indicator target for 2020 - 95 grammes of CO2 per kilometre. That is good news. But of course we want to go further.

The UK Government has been determined to create the right conditions for the development of the early market for ultra low emission vehicles - ULEVs [youlevs] as they are known. We have made a £400m commitment. 

Last year we put in place the Plug-In Car Grant and extended it to vans this year. This has helped generate a step change in the uptake of ULEVs.

Total claims in the first half of this year are more than we saw in the whole of 2011. 

And with new models coming to the market, I expect to see this trend sustained and growing, in line with our expectations.

Of course it is the case that people are hardly likely to buy a ULEV if they don't see the infrastructure needed to use them already in place. 

So, the Coalition Government has taken a lead on this with the Plugged In Places programme. And I'm delighted that, as we anticipated, the private sector has now seen the commercial opportunity this presents and come in with really significant investment. 

Further evidence, if any more were needed, that creating growth and cutting carbon are 2 sides of the same coin.

The combined number of private and public sector charge-points now stands at around six thousand.

Of course hydrogen is also one of the options to decarbonise transport. 

With industry we have set up the UK H2 Mobility project.

It's looking at the potential for ""hydrogen fuel cell"" electric vehicles - and what investment would be required to commercialise the technology, including refuelling infrastructure, from 2015. 

It is good news that London, where there is already a significant level of hydrogen activity, is pitching for a leading role in this field.

As well as having ULEV responsibilities, my portfolio also covers what's known as ""smarter choices"". Changing the way we travel isn't just about changing the car we drive or how we deliver goods.

It's about thinking differently - even as far as thinking whether on each occasion we need to travel at all, now we are in the age of video-conferencing and other ground-shifting technology.

These Olympics have been like a test bed, stimulating people to try fresh approaches and allowing individuals and organisations to re-engineer how they go about their business. I hope and expect that these changes won't be a one-off.

For many of you here today the focus of interest will be London. 

And London has certainly been rich with innovation on the transport front.

But countrywide, funding made available by the Government, like the £560m Local Sustainable Transport Fund, now increased to £600m, the Green Bus Fund, and funding for the low carbon truck demonstration trial, is helping to spark real innovation. 

Let's remember, it is the short-distance local trip where the biggest opportunity exists for people to make sustainable transport choices.

Around two out of every three trips we make are less than 5 miles in length. Many of them could be easily walked or undertaken by public transport, with cycling an increasingly popular option.

I have been determined to help deliver funding to create an environment where people can feel confident about cycling.

There are some really good projects going on around the country.

Now I am not complacent in the least about any of this. There are huge challenges in transport, not least in terms of air quality where there is still much to do.",transcript,reducing-greenhouse-gases-and-other-emissions-from-transport,,norman-baker,"Investing in Future Transport Conference, London City Hall",department-for-transport,21-Sep-2012,2012-09-21

[North West Biofuels Network speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvV1BrPSrSQ)

Hello, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person today… but, courtesy of video technology, I'm pleased that I can at least make a small contribution to the proceedings.

At the end of last year I explained why I believe we will only be successful in our transport strategy - of creating growth and cutting carbon - if we effect behavioural change and provide genuinely sustainable transport. I also spoke about the role of biofuels within our strategy.

We have made some significant progress since then, both in terms of assuring the sustainability of biofuels used in the UK and in respect of investment and growth.

Building on voluntary reporting under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (the RTFO) we took an important step last December with the introduction of mandatory sustainability criteria.

Earlier this year the first biofuels meeting that criteria were reported. This was only achieved by working closely with suppliers, and the RTFO Administrator continues to ensure suppliers get the advice they need. 

UK-produced biofuels have shown some potentially high carbon savings compared with fossil fuels. 

Provisional data reported for UK feedstocks under the RTFO suggests greenhouse gas savings from biofuel made from UK feedstocks was 77%.

The volume of UK produced biofuel has also increased in the first three years of the RTFO - from 109 to 331 million litres per year.

As assurance of the carbon reduction credentials of biofuels has improved, so we have also witnessed examples of growth in the UK.

I was very pleased to be asked to open the impressive Agri Energy biodiesel plant in Bootle in Liverpool in May - and I understand that you will be hearing more about this project today. 

It is imperative that we keep seeing profitable investments like this which produce low carbon energy. In the UK, enterprise like this can create jobs and develop expertise in the biofuels industry and help us to meet our ambitious carbon reduction targets. 

I was similarly encouraged by Vivergo's investment in Hull and its ambition to become the largest bioethanol and animal feed producer in Europe. It is another significant investment in the UK's future and energy infrastructure and an example of British ingenuity and co-operation. 

So I'm seeing some really encouraging signs out there…..green UK businesses are showing how partnerships between companies - and the sharing of knowledge and expertise across different industries - can provide models with the potential to deliver genuinely sustainable product and minimise waste.

I am proud of the UK's progress. I also recognise that the role of Government is to sustain a fertile investment climate. So my aim is to provide a clear policy framework. One based on good scientific evidence and which provides assurance of the sustainability of biofuels. 

We are clear that biofuels have a role to play in tackling climate change, particularly where we cannot otherwise easily decarbonise, such as in aviation and HGVs. However, the Coalition Government is adamant that wherever they are used, biofuels must be genuinely sustainable. We remain very concerned that studies and impact assessments have demonstrated that some biofuels actually produce greater carbon emissions than fossil fuels, particularly when indirect land use change is factored in. 

We continue to press the European Commission for clarity on indirect land use change policy and I have written to EU Commissioners to press the UK's position more than once.

But let me be candid about this - I do not believe that setting further short-term interim targets can in practice provide the clarity industry needs while the issue of indirect land use change remains to be properly tackled by the European Commission. 

I believe we should firmly entrench the goalposts as soon as we can, but only when we are confident that we do not have to move them again.

In April, the Bioenergy Strategy, a cross-Whitehall strategy was released.

This recognises the importance of low ILUC-risk first generation biofuels. 

It also acknowledges that, in the medium-to-longer term, we will need to develop second generation and other advanced biofuels. 

We will continue to review how best to support this growing industry and meet our greenhouse gas emission and energy targets.

To incentivise advanced biofuels and waste derived biofuels, we have introduced double rewards under the RTFO.

This is because these feedstocks are unlikely to compete with food production or contribute to indirect land use change. 

I accept that there are concerns regarding the fluctuation of the value of RTFCs. This year is unique because of amendments to the RTFO in December. So it's probably too soon to tell whether the recent RTFC prices reflect a longer term trend. 

We will continue to consider the impacts of double certification, and I have committed to review double certification in 2013 to ensure that it is having a positive effect on the biofuel industry. 

We are interested in the potential to use biofuels in sectors where options to decarbonise are limited. 

For example the potential use of sustainable biomethane made from waste in the heavy goods vehicle sector. 

There are real market barriers to uptake of low emission Heavy Goods Vehicle technologies such as hybrid, electric and gas. 

The Government has made available £9.5m capital funding to pump prime procurement - via the Low Carbon Truck demonstration trial, launched in March.

Successful applicants will get targeted funding for refuelling infrastructure, and for low carbon vehicles like gas and dual fuel trucks.

Biofuels are of course just one part of a wider strategy to encourage growth and cut carbon. 

We are committed to supporting the uptake of ultra low carbon vehicles in the United Kingdom. 

The Government has made provision of over £400 million to support the development of the ultra low emission vehicle market work to 2015. This includes funding;

  * for recharging infrastructure schemes,
  * to promote the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles through the Plug-In Car and Van Grants and 
  * £82 million of support for research and development

In addition UKH2Mobility was launched in January. This joint undertaking with key industry stakeholders will evaluate the potential for hydrogen as a fuel for Ultra Low Carbon Vehicles in the UK.

We are also backing a revolution in bus travel with a multi-million pound Green Bus Fund - a scheme that has helped to deliver more than 500 low carbon buses on routes across England. And, notably, much of this work has been done by UK companies.

To conclude…generating economic growth and cutting carbon emissions are not mutually exclusive - they are two sides of the same coin. 

This is particularly true of the biofuels industry which has become an important part of the UK economy, of our national infrastructure and our efforts to meet international emission and energy targets. 

To get the best result for the consumer, the environment and the taxpayer we will continue to work closely with industry in addressing barriers to supplying sustainable biofuel in the transport sector. This is why Networks such as yours are so important in providing a forum to develop and share knowledge.

We will also continue to ensure that the full consequences of growing biofuels are considered and assessed. This is essential if Government is to provide a clear policy framework which encourages growth. 

I know that, at the EU level there is work to do on issues such as ILUC. But I am confident that, together, we have made some significant progress towards assuring that biofuels used in the UK are sustainable.

## Transcript

**Voiceover:** The Government is committed to the development of ultra-low emission vehicles and, to encourage businesses to invest in plug-in vans, the Secretary of State launched the new Plug-In Van Grant, at an event held at County Hall in London. 

**Justine Greening:** Well, we're announcing the plugged-in vans grant. That's saying that you can get up to 20% or up to £8,000 of grant towards buying a electric van or a hybrid van, and that should really help start to drive that switch from polluting diesel vans to more cleaner, greener hybrid and electric vans.

It's really important because we know that one of the key drivers of emissions in the UK, of course, is road transport, and particularly cars and vans, so if we can start to get that switch on to more ultra-low emission vehicles then that's really going to help us meet our targets.

**Pete Waterman:** The cost of diesel now is huge. So if you're going to save money - and, you know, being… you know, all this 'worried about the pound in my pocket', particularly as you get older; as you know, money becomes, you know, important to you - I think that, you know, is a viable option.

**Justine Greening:** Of course, for businesses it can make business sense too, because anybody who has filled up their van or their car with petrol or diesel recently knows just how expensive it is, so actually we're going to not just help the environment - this is about helping business too.

**Paul Everitt:** Ultra-low carbon vehicles are very much the future of the industry. We expect to see a transition to this type of technology over the coming years, and it's very important not just to meet our environmental challenges and targets, but also our industrial ambitions.

**Dan Taylor:** We've got a really big fleet - we've got the third largest fleet in the UK with around 12,000 vans - so for us it's really important that we look at all the options to make our fleet as green as possible and obviously as cost-efficient as possible. And with today's announcement around the grant, absolutely, it's beginning to stack up in terms of the numbers.

We've got a mission over the next 10 years to reduce our carbon footprint, and transport's going to be a massive part of that, so we've really got to decarbonise our transport. That's going to add up financially and economically, but also from the environmental perspective, we don't have a lot of choice to make this work. So we're proud to be leading the way, and as I say, we've got 150 vehicles to be on the road by the end of next year.

**Justine Greening:** What it shows is that business is starting to look seriously about how it can green its fleet. We know that's incredibly important; it's one of the reasons why the Plugged-in Places investment has really focused on the workplace - that's where people have their car and it can charge up whilst they're there. So business is really, really important, whether you're working at business or whether you're running a fleet, and that's one of the reasons why we're delighted that British Gas is, in a sense, leading the way.

**Richard Deslandes:** Each individual electric vehicle has its place, whether it's a 3.5 tonner or whether it's the inner city runaround like our own. I think they all have their place and we're all going to benefit from this… these initiatives.

**Paul Everitt:** We've got a number of products here that are produced in the UK; a number of the others also have technology that is being developed and manufactured here in the UK. So if we want to compete globally on the types of vehicles that we are going to be producing in the future, it's essential that we create a supply chain for those technologies here in the UK. And so the grant is part of that strategy. It persuades people that the UK's a good place to develop this technology, to demonstrate it, but in the long term hopefully manufacture it, and export it to other places around the world.

**Richard Deslandes:** I think that the electric van incentive is actually an essential part of developing electric strategy in a city, public utility companies, and so on and so forth, need this kind of boost. 

**Paul Everitt:** For us this is a very important step. We hope to see a significant take-up of the grant over the course of the next well, not just this year but over the course of the next three to five years. And as we get that, and we build volume in the marketplace, then we will see the technology both improve but also reduce in cost.

**Dan Taylor:** I think, the grant that's announced today, together with some of the additional benefits, things like the congestion charging, et cetera, in London, really begin to help make the case stack up. So we're fully behind it.

**Richard Deslandes:** What is interesting is that continental Europe looks with certainly slightly green eyes at the UK, where there is, I think, a serious level of joined-up thinking; whether it comes from OLEV, or whether it comes from the EV Group at the SMMT, whether it comes from plugged-in places, whether it comes from the Mayor's initiatives, I think there's some serious joined-up thinking in the UK which the rest of the Europe would do very well to emulate.

[Responding to local needs to improve outcomes keynote address](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzawsFUFpcc)

Thank you for inviting me to give the keynote address at this year's National Highways and Transport Network Conference. I am also pleased that the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme is helping support this annual conference for the second year.

First let me say that I am very sorry I can't be with you in person, but I am glad that I can be virtually with you at least.

I am always interested in what the National Highways and Transport Network Surveys results reveal about what the public actually think about the various aspect of transport in their local areas. I understand that 75 local authorities subscribed to this year's survey and, given the total number of interviews in each area, this represents a significant insight into public perception.

As the Minister with particular responsibility for local transport, how we respond and accommodate local needs is something at the very heart of what I am involved in day-to-day.

The Coalition Government has placed Localism at the centre of its plans. I am pleased to say that we have made considerable progress. This has included the Localism Bill passing through Parliament and now becoming the Localism Act.

However, responding to local needs is about far more than an Act of Parliament. So let me say something about how this is working in the Department for Transport. 

Firstly, our future plans for rail will give local areas more say on their rail services, including a mechanism for local transport bodies, working with the industry, to more easily sponsor additional local services.

I have published our proposals for devolving the funding we provide for local major schemes to local transport bodies that comprise local authorities and local business, through local economic partnerships, working together.

Of course our capital funding via both the Integrated Transport block and the Highway Maintenance block is already effectively devolved. This is because what local authorities get is based on established formulae, and the recipients have autonomy in how they use the funds, allowing them to better respond to local needs and priorities.

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund has provided a large number of local authorities, often working together, with £600 million for schemes that create growth and cut carbon at the local level. I am particularly pleased with the wide range of proposals we were able to support, and local councils have come up with imaginative and innovative proposals. Yes, there was competition for the available funding pot, but as many of you know we received applications involving every eligible local authority in England.

The Government is playing its part in setting out some high level messages supporting sustainable transport and especially cycling, whilst leaving the detail and delivery very much to be determined at the local level.

The nationwide campaign for road safety has for some years now been based around the THINK branding. I am pleased to say that because of the general upsurge in cycling in recent times - not least because of Team GB's success in the Olympics - we have recently announced a new THINKCYCLIST campaign. The key message is that drivers and cyclists actually have more in common than is often realised. The campaign is therefore about both groups of road users being aware of each other.

The Coalition Government recognises that well maintained national and local highways are important to the economy, to all road users and to local residents. 

Despite the difficult economic situation we inherited we are providing over £3 billion to councils across England for local road maintenance between 2011 and 2015.

Now I know there is significant scope for many local authorities to change their approach, to emulate the best practice to be found in well-performing authorities, to find efficiencies and to achieve more from their spending on local roads.

In these tight fiscal times, we must all - central and local government alike - use resources much more efficiently to get the best value for money for the taxpayer. 

There are over 150 different highway authorities, very often doing things in quite different ways. It is clear that councils can learn from each other and get more for less. 

This is one of the reasons why I launched the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme in April 2011 - a £6 million initiative running until 2018 to improve efficiencies and maximise returns on investment in highways maintenance. 

One of the Programme's key hallmarks is that it is sector-led. So, working in partnership it is for local highway authorities and the providers of maintenance services, many of which are from the private sector, to determine the programme's scope and shape its content. 

It's also an initiative rooted in this Government's commitment to localism, devolution and empowerment. 

I am pleased that the Programme's work is now well underway and products like the Local Highway Authority Collaborative Alliance Toolkit have recently been launched. It is already being used by several potential groups of local authorities to form their own alliances.

I understand that several further tools covering Asset Management and Standardisation of Contracts & Specification are due to be launched this autumn, with others in line for user testing.

I was also pleased to see that the Final Report of the Pothole Review was published in April and that its recommendations got a good reception. The programme has now put in place an implementation Plan to ensure its recommendations are delivered.

I would like to pick up on the Customer, Quality and Cost work being done within the National Highways and Transport Network. 

In my view the local authorities responsible for highway maintenance can better respond to local needs in their area, if they have a full picture of all three dimensions. These are:

Firstly, customer perceptions - as revealed by for instance the National Highways and Transport Network survey;

Secondly, quality - the technical quality of carriageways and footways as revealed by the detailed surveys undertaken by highway authorities;

And thirdly, cost - as reflected in the resources spent on maintenance.

Whilst this approach is currently being refined by the National Highways and Transport Network for highways maintenance, the concept may prove equally useful for other aspects of transport such as cycling, walking and road safety.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that work the National Highways and Transport Network undertakes, especially making information on local transport available to local people, is very important. The National Highways and Transport Network both elicits the Customer's Perception, and also makes it available 'warts and all' to everyone. This is in keeping with the Coalition Government's policy to increase transparency within all levels of government and throughout the public sector. And having the information widely available allows for analysis and continuous improvement in the outputs and outcomes.

So thank you for listening and I trust you all have an interesting and successful day.",transcript,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,,norman-baker,National Highways and Transport Network Annual Conference,department-for-transport,22-Oct-2012,2012-10-22

Thank you for inviting me to speak today.

And while I cannot be with you in person, it seems rather apt for me to appear in virtual form, as your conference examines how evolving technologies might be harnessed to create a smarter city. 

For me, this theme chimes very closely with an important element of the work I have been driving forward during my time in Government: developing a transport system that creates growth and reduces carbon emissions by maximising the role technology plays in changing the way we work and live. 

The growth of cities has historically been driven by industrial advancements - new engineering techniques, increased transport capability, global business expansion. As our cities sprawled, we responded by building more homes and expanding our transport networks to widen the geographical reach of our economic centres.

Travel to work areas stretched, and it is now common for someone to live over an hour, or even two hours, from where they work. This comes with inevitable costs to the environment and employee wellbeing, not to mention the impact on congestion. 

So we are now taking a step back. We're looking at the shape of the world we've created, and we're considering 'what next'? What will be the next iteration of the 'modern city'? And how can the UK remain at the forefront of that evolution? People cannot keep travelling further and further, and they most certainly cannot do so while confined by the working hours that tradition, and habit, so often dictate. 

That is why the Department for Transport is looking for smart solutions to the traditional problems we've faced. Solutions that are low-cost and high-reward. Solutions that help us deliver what we need to, while also ensuring minimal negative impact on the end user. 

Our biggest city has just shown us what is possible. During this great summer, it wasn't just the sport that was a major achievement: our already busy transport network in London stood up to an influx of around one million extra daily visitors. 

But it wasn't just an increase in transport provision that made the Olympics and Paralympics a success. It was also behaviour change. People listened to our messages on the expected demand increase. They thought about how they usually travel. And they adopted changes to make their journeys more enjoyable. 

For some people it may have been flexing the hours they worked, or changing their route to avoid the busiest places at the busiest times. For others, it was perhaps walking or cycling part or all of the way.

Still others embraced technology. They replaced face-to-face meetings with teleconferences and videoconferences. They worked from unaffected locations, such as an office hub or home. 

This exemplifies the way technology is changing the way we live and work. And it is Expos like this that are at the forefront of the revolution. Telecommunications have become an inextricable part of our offices. Videoconferencing and teleconferencing are becoming commonplace, and working whilst on the move is now the norm.

So now we are left asking: why can't every day be like it was during the Games? And the truth is: it can. 

We've already seen some excellent thinking around the city of the future. A recent paper by Microsoft comes to mind, a white paper on the Anywhere Working City. It introduced the concept of a 'third space' - a space between the office and the home where people can connect via technology. Global Action Plan's 'Business in Motion' paper examined how technology could reduce our impact on the environment. And Business in the Community's ways2work campaign connects business leaders with best practice on how businesses can reduce their impact on the transport network. 

**These kinds of sector-led initiatives will surely continue. But where does Government fit in?**

For us in the Department for Transport, the priority is integrated infrastructure.

That is why Government is looking at door-to-door journeys. What does a person need to make their journey from door-to-door both seamless and convenient? What can we do to facilitate and enable that journey? Is it technology? Is it better transport facilities? We are working closely with industry and key stakeholders to develop a strategy that will set the scene for door-to-door journeys into the future. This will enable others to deliver a well-connected, smart and sustainable transport system that works for everyone.

The smart ticketing technology that we are investing in has the potential to transform the way that passengers think about and pay for travel on public transport. As part of our Rail Fares & Ticketing review, we are looking at how we can use smart ticketing to offer innovative and new ticket types that reflect modern working patterns. 

It's also why we're supporting the transition to ultra-low emission vehicles. Yes, we are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent from 1990 levels between 2023 to 2027. But we also recognise that people care about the climate.

So we offer a Plug-in Car Grant and a Plug-in Van Grant to stimulate the market, and help with the upfront costs for those motorists choosing to purchase these ultra-low emission vehicles. We have also committed up to £30m of match-funding to the Plugged-In Places Programme, supporting the development of plug-in vehicle recharging infrastructure. 

And we continue to look at the bigger picture. Through our £600m Local Sustainable Transport Fund, we asked local authorities to look at sustainable transport within their communities, and consider what would be needed to help create growth and cut carbon.

Within central Government, we will look at our own internal processes, and consider how we can work better. We will take the lessons we have learned throughout the Games, and identify opportunities for long-term change, to maximise efficiency, increase business resilience, and provide the best possible service to the taxpayer.

Because, ultimately, that is what a Smart City is. It's a city that provides a high quality, integrated, and joined-up experience for those living within it. And I look forward to continuing to play a role in delivering that end goal.

Thank you.",transcript,reducing-greenhouse-gases-and-other-emissions-from-transport,,norman-baker,Smart Cities Expo 2012,department-for-transport,27-Sep-2012,2012-09-27

## Transcript

Well I'm here this morning to help launch the department's campaign on cycle safety. It's a THINK! campaign, because over the past four years we've seen more and more people quite rightly wanting to get on their bikes and get cycling. And unfortunately we have seen a rise also in people injured in accidents. 

And what I'm doing today is launching a campaign, which says to people, drivers and cyclists, are not two different beings, not two different worlds. Most people, a lot of people, who cycle drive, a lot of people who drive cycle as well. What I'm saying to them is think about some of the very basic things you could do that would increase the safety on the roads for everyone.

If you're a driver for instance, first of all make sure when you turn left you look, make sure you're signalling is done nice and early as possible, so people have that clear intent. When you coming to traffic lights, observe the space in front of you for cyclists, so that their visibility is increased. 

And when you're a cyclist, look out for what cars are doing, but also make sure it's clear if your, as you're going to undertake that there's good width between you and the car. I'm asking car driver to also ook at the distance between it and the cyclist.

After the Olympics and after the Paralympics, I think we're going to see, already people are saying to me they want to get out and cycle. We've seen people report that there are more people out there cycling. And I think after that success, more and more people are going to be cycling and I wanted to launch this campaign as soon as we could after the Olympics to make sure that capturing all the success, more people wanting to cycle, that they cycle safely.",transcript,making-roads-safer,,stephen-hammond,THINK! cyclist campaign launch,department-for-transport,10-Sep-2012,2012-09-10
