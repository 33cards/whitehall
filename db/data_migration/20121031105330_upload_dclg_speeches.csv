http://www.communities.gov.uk/articles/newsroom/2113161,£1 million fund to tackle binge and under-age drinking,"* * *

In my third report _Building Safe, Active Communities: Strong foundations by local people_, published last month, I said that we need to take urgent action to tackle binge and under-age drinking.

I stressed the importance of local communities having a say in the actions that affect them. I announced a £1 million fund to enable up to 10 areas to step forward and make a difference, by working in partnerships with the local authority, local services and local people. Other areas which are not successful could also have one of their ideas financially supported through the fund.

The application process is now open, and I look forward to reading the good ideas that will be put forward. There is no set formula - we need to allow local people to come up with the actions that they want to see. I have purposefully made the process as simple as can be, and written in easily understood language, so that any activist facing the struggle against drink-related bad behaviour will be encouraged to think about applying.

The fund will bring together all interested parties - the local council, police, schools, youth groups, the NHS, local retailers and ordinary people - all those who have a keen interest in tackling binge and under-age drinking, and can contribute expertise or personal experience in this area. There must be a co-ordinated community approach. I have seen how successful projects can be when everybody works as one and I really look forward to working with these areas over two years as they transform their neighbourhoods.

Their innovative approaches will be shared so we can roll out the best ideas across the country. The legacy of this fund is to develop strong partnerships, and to ensure that local people, the activists who work tirelessly to improve their area, are given the support and empowerment to make a real, and long lasting difference.

The Prime Minister said on Monday that at the heart of the Big Society is rebuilding responsibility and giving people more control over their lives. Both principles are exemplified in the ways in which local councils treat the voluntary sector. Councils who have had their eyes and ears open have known for years that an era of economy is imminent. When we are spending approaching twice as much each year on paying the interest on our national debt than Council Tax raises in England, the reckoning was bound to come - even Alastair Darling warned, as Chancellor, of imminent ""deep and tough"" cuts in public spending.

In these dire circumstances, the burden of adjustment on Local Authorities was made as sensibly as it could have been. We changed the formula we inherited to give relatively more help to areas of deprivation; imposed a maximum reduction in spending power of 8.8 percent next year (with an average of 4.4 percent); and ensured councils most reliant on central funding to have proportionately lower falls in grant, so that people in Hackney will receive £1043 per head and those in Wokingham £125 per head. And, when this period is over, formula grant will not be at the level it was thirty years ago in cash terms, but what it was as recently as 2008.

In years past, central government micromanaged what local councils did with their money. They were increasingly forced to become more like branch offices for Whitehall than bastions of local choice. By getting rid of ring fencing and the over prescription of Comprehensive Area Assessment we have given unprecedented new freedoms to councils to choose how best to spend their taxpayers' money. For most councils this is liberation. For a few, though, the chains that bound them have come to be worn as a security blanket to avoid having to think independently and responsibly. That's why I believe the way in which a local council approaches the cuts is the first public test of its underlying competence and responsibility in the new localist world. It is the first of many signals to its electorate of whether theirs is a council leadership worth having. Some, like Hammersmith and Fulham, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Trafford and West Cheshire and Chester have seized on the opportunity to do things differently and better. Others, having failed to prepare for what everyone else knew was coming, have used the pressure not as a chance to do things differently, but to dole out cuts in a crude and regressive way.

I believe that the key test of responsibility is how a council deals with its voluntary and community sector. Any council that cuts funding to voluntary and community groups and to social enterprises by more than it makes economies in its own operations will have outed itself as falling short of the standard of responsibility people expect. People need to know that, which is why we are requiring every council to publish changes to what it spends in-house and changes to what it spends with the voluntary sector.

But the best councils are going beyond this basic level of responsibility. They are recognising that sitting down with their local voluntary sector to explore what other services they can provide can help them transform the services they deliver to the public. They are releasing the voluntary sector from the walled garden of small grants into which they have been confined and allowing community groups access to more of the council's services.

The Localism Bill, currently before parliament, entrenches rights for local voluntary groups to be taken seriously when they have good ideas about how things can be done differently. The least progressive councils fear that challenge but the best are embracing it already. That's why I think - and I expect local people will - that any council contemplating cuts to the voluntary sector would be acting unreasonably if they simply handed down those cuts from on high. Instead they should sit down with every organisation affected for a candid and open conversation as to what alternatives are available and how they could participate in areas of the council's services that are currently off limits.

As the Prime Minister said, rebuilding responsibility must characterise the Big Society. Responsibility is forged when decisions are difficult. This is a moment of maturity for local government. Taking responsibility - for consequences and for communities - is essential if central and local government are to grow beyond a relationship as between parent and child, to one joining mature adults.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I'm delighted to be reunited with IPPR North. I was with you when I set out my goals as Cities Minister, so it's only fitting that I be here today as we set out the next steps in our plans to put England's cities in control of their economic destiny.

The remarkable building we stand in today is a symbol of the civic pride and independence that first flourished thanks, in no small part, to the clout of local industry. It is just such independence, and such economic success, that we aim to reignite today.

After the long, slow decline of the mid-twentieth century, many of England's cities have begun to take real steps forward. They have reversed the urban flight of the 1970s. Many have seen fresh investment in civic buildings and town centres. 

But the picture is not uniformly bright. Many of our cities struggle with long-term challenges, both social and economic. Even in the supposed boom decade leading up to 2008, the number of private sector jobs in Nottingham, Sheffield and Birmingham actually fell, leaving them all more vulnerable when recession struck. And the most prosperous English cities still struggle to outshine competitors on the continent when it comes to innovation and skills. The facts make for sombre reading:

Frankfurt, Rennes and Bologna see twice as many patent applications per head as any English core city. Stuggart has five times as many.

Bilbao, Toulouse and Dresden have comfortably more graduates per resident than any of our core cities.

In England, Bristol is the only core city that has GDP per head above the national average - while in Germany, every single one of the eight biggest cities outside Berlin has better than average GDP per head. In other words, German core cities are the engines of national growth, generating wealth and prosperity, pulling the rest of the country behind them. Most English core cities are not doing the same - yet.

Yet we know that, overall, English cities have so many of the right ingredients. They account for more than their fair share of jobs; they are home to a critical mass of creative, entrepreneurial people; they house many of the universities and centres of research which will pave the way for the new technologies, techniques and processes that will be the key to growth in the coming decades.

This country invented the modern city in the 19th century. I want us to reinvent the city for the 21st. I want our all cities to be thriving places, living up to their full economic potential, matching growth with greener ways of living and doing business. And the fact is, as we all know, that when our cities do well, our country does well.

To achieve this, we need a shift in the way Whitehall works.

Instead of a tight focus on the very urban core, we need policies that recognise how cities really work, the flow of people and jobs and money between the centre and periphery. The fates of both are intimately linked. For example: it's impossible to dissociate what happens in central Birmingham from what happens in Selly Oak or Sutton Coldfield. Through Local Enterprise Partnerships, we are encouraging local leaders to think and work together in ways that reflect their true economic geography.

Instead of seeing Government's job in cities as being primarily to arrest decline, we should be seizing opportunities for growth. Sustainable, long-term prosperity does not come from indefinite heavy reliance on public funding. Forward-thinking leaders are already facing up to the challenge of improving their offer to the private sector. Many are considering, for example, how they will be able to use the New General Power of Competence to boost skills, encourage entrepreneurs and attract investors.

Perhaps most important, Whitehall needs to get better at listening to cities. Rather than prescribing pat solutions, rather than ""rolling out"" an approach designed by a bunch of bright people in a room in SW1, I believe we can best enable cities to live up to their full potential by letting them articulate their own needs and aspirations, and putting power in their hands. It's self-evident that what's good for Leeds isn't necessarily good for Bristol; that Mancunians may wish to organise their own affairs in their distinctive ways, and exercise different powers to Liverpudlians.

Over the past months, I've been in discussion with the biggest cities outside London. I've been asking them a genuine, open question: if it was entirely up to you - what powers would you draw down, what flexibility over funding would you want, what discretion would you need to boost your local economy and make your city the best place it could be?

Naturally there have been a few wry smiles, the odd ""we've heard it all before."" Delivering on the promise is what counts. But even old hands sat up and took notice when we amended the Localism Act. Simply by creating the means to devolve powers to cities and their partners, we have gone further than any recent administration I can think of. To make real progress, however, we must match these new means with a new mindset.

On one hand, we need renewed leadership from cities.

Cities need to make a case for new powers - with a clear evidence base, and a strong economic rationale. They have to show how new flexibilities could benefit local people. They will have to demonstrate how they will manage budgets, and hold themselves accountable to residents.

While there are evident differences between London and the core cities, the capital's experience is instructive all the same. In London, the transfer of powers was predicated on the leadership a mayor can provide. Over the past eleven years, the capital has benefited immensely from having a clear and accountable figurehead with a strong mandate -  attracting investment; giving a strategic direction to the development of infrastructure and public services; and raising the city's prestige and international profile. So well has the model worked, that we have been able, with parliament's consent, to extend new powers to the mayor through the Localism Act over housing and regeneration. As a result, the winner of the 2012 mayoral election will have a wider set of tools than ever to galvanise the capital. It could be a real moment of lift-off for London.

Next year, a dozen other English cities will have the chance to vote on whether to move to a mayoralty. Let me be explicit. Local leadership can come in many different forms, but mayors provide, in my opinion, the clearest form of all. Where city deals must be underpinned by accountability and leadership, elected mayors will without question meet that test. And whatever path other cities choose, it's clear that a local leader or leaders able to marshal resources, speak truth to national government, and represent the city to the world, will be crucial in closing the gap between London and the rest. Balanced growth, with new jobs and businesses in every town and city, will be far better for local people and the nation as a whole.

When city leaders make a proposal about the powers they want, and what they could achieve with them, my colleagues and I in Whitehall will examine them carefully.

But we start from the assumption that the onus shouldn't be on cities to do all the legwork, and to have to present themselves as supplicants. Whitehall needs a new demeanour. Where cities have made a reasonable case, and Whitehall wants to retain control, the burden should be on central government to show why it's necessary and proportionate to keep influence and power at the centre. I want my colleagues and civil servants to start by asking themselves ""why not pass down power?"".

As in any negotiation, there will be an element of back and forth, of offers and counteroffers before we reach consensus. The deals we strike will most likely be as distinctive as our cities themselves - with power devolved in proportion to evidence of leadership and potential for growth.

Today we have produced a paper, based on debate so far with cities and across Whitehall, that will set the framework for the next stage. It shows the areas where I think there is room for real discussion, real movement about cities drawing down powers and funding. As you'll see, it's a big list. Some twenty new powers, flexibilities and freedoms over Budgets. Housing. Transport. Skills and worklessness. Planning.

In many cases, these are freedoms and flexibilities that cities have been crying out for a generation or more, at long last within their grasp. We could see cities wielding greater influence than ever before over how and where the homes their growing population needs get built, over the train and bus services that take them to work, over the inward investment that supports new job and industries. The scope and the ambition speak about our commitment to getting our cities firing on all cylinders.

The next step of course is to bring the different deals with cities to a head. There's a lot of hard work to come but I couldn't wish for a more important or more fulfilling task for the New Year. I want to see England's cities proud and resurgent; home to thriving businesses and new jobs; recognised as some of the best places to live and work not in Europe.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

It's a striking fact that the people gathered together in this room will, collectively, have a greater impact on the way Britain will live during the decades ahead than almost any gathering of people of a similar size anywhere in the UK.

The way our cities, towns and villages will look.

How amenable they are to living, working and relaxing in them.

Whether our towns and our countryside are supporting more wildlife, or whether nature is in decline.

Whether the places we work in are liberating and inspiring, or mean and depressing.

Whether we travel easily and quickly, or whether getting about impairs our health and our environment.

Whether the places in which children not yet born will have their childhood are places they will remember as special, or as hostile.

There is scarcely a more momentous responsibility than that which is embodied in this profession and I count it as an enormous privilege to have been working with you during the last year.

For me, the purpose of planning is to help make the way we live our lives better tomorrow than it is today.

And not just tomorrow - but a million tomorrows, so that nothing our generation does compromises the ability - indeed the right - of future generations to improve their own lives.

Planning is not merely preservation. Our lives tomorrow will not be better if our built environment stays the same.

In fact - with a growing population, changing household characteristics, and new technologies - they will be considerably worse if we don't change.

We need more housing - many more houses - new workplaces, new transport systems, and new infrastructure to support the way we live now and the way we will live in the future.

So planning is about growth - but it is not just the growth in the built environment.

I believe our natural environment can be better cared for.

Historic habitats that have been destroyed can be re-established.

Species that have become trapped in isolated refuges must be reconnected.

Monotonous swathes of brown masquerading as 'green belt' should be improved to live up to their name and be refilled by nature.

And the green belt should be somewhere in which people, especially those in towns and cities, can hope to encounter nature and air and openness personally, rather than view it from a nose pressed against a car window on a ring road.

Our design can be much better than it is. Ours is a country which is home to more than our fair share of the world's best architects, and communities who are passionate about the places that they call home.

Mostly, we love where we live, and that is an ideal circumstance for excellence.

So the purpose of planning is development - but sustainable development, driving social, economic and environmental improvements for successive generations.

Everything you do, everything I want to do with you, is to champion sustainable development - and there is equal emphasis on both those words.

But our planning system has - over a long period - drifted from delivering its potential.

Planning has become too defensive, too pessimistic.

Indeed, we have reached a point in which the default assumption by much of the public is that any particular change to our built environment will be negative.

That it will tend to impair beauty, damage the environment and make residents' lives worse.

The planning process, far from being a forum for inclusion and potential, has become an arena of antagonism in which acrimony and litigation have too often replaced co-operation and community.

True sustainability - actually improving the economic, environment and social conditions for future generations as well as our own - has been the victim of this lowered horizon.

That's why the public perception of planning has got to change - from being a pessimistic, zero-sum (or even negative sum) wrangle to being a creative exercise in economic, aesthetic, social and environmental improvement.

The challenge for the planning profession is to be agents of creativity - emphasising inspiration, community leadership, finding solutions.

All the reforms we contemplated in Opposition - and which we are now implementing in Government - are based on reorienting the system towards promoting sustainable development.

The opportunity for every neighbourhood to develop a vision for their future and - if they can win the support of a majority in that community - have it adopted as part of the development plan.

The abolition of the top-down regional spatial strategies - which were a crude, remote and resented bureaucratic solution to the timeless problem of how to reflect the larger-than-local aspects that are essential to good planning.

The replacement of regional administrative fiat with a duty to co-operate - not just between neighbouring councils, but between all relevant public bodies - represents a more human, more natural, more positive way of giving proper voice to strategic planning, and I'm grateful to the RTPI for their help in strengthening this duty during the Localism Bill committee.

The determination that the benefits of development should not be instantly and totally vacuumed up by the national Treasury from every community that hosts development, but that much more of it should be kept by the communities themselves - whether through CIL, the New Homes Bonus or - as the review of local government finance will soon establish - the retention of more of the business rates generated by new development.

These benefits - already morally the property of the communities - can be used for all of the purposes of sustainable development: to improve the local economy including by investing in infrastructure; to improve the environment and to improve the social wellbeing of an area.

The replacement of a set of national policy documents that has grown and grown until it contains more words than the complete works of Shakespeare (but which is rather less lyrical) - making it completely inaccessible to all but the experts - with what will be a clear, concise statement of policy that in its clarity and simplicity communicates purposefully the aims of national policy.

And, perhaps the reform that best embodies a switch to can-do planning; an approach in plan-making and decision-taking to a positive volition for sustainable development: a new presumption in favour of sustainable development which will be a golden thread running through national policy to plan-making to decision-taking.

I am publishing tomorrow a working draft of the presumption that I am minded to take, in advance of the publication of a whole draft  National Planning Policy Framework next month.

Let me give you a taste of it now.

The presumption in favour of sustainable development will mean that every local council should:

  * plan positively for new development
  * prepare local plans on the basis that objectively assessed development needs should be met
  * approve development proposals that accords with plans without delay  
and,
  * grant permission where a plan is absent, silent or out of date.

Unless, in each case, to do so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the policy objectives of sustainable development - defined, economically, environmentally and socially.

As was said by a planning officer in this morning's session - the presumption entrenches plan-making at the heart of the system.

Excellent communities and councils should have sound, up-to-date plans that embody the presumption in favour of sustainable development. Without an up-to-date local plan, decisions will be made according to national policy.

The emphasis is on finding ways by which development that can enhance the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of an area, now and in the future - in sustainable development - can be made.

As Steve Quartermain said this morning he, like most people in this room, went into planning to make things happen.

The new world which we are about to enter is a challenge for this profession.

I have said before that planners have been the victims of the creeping delegitimisation of the system you have worked in.

You have been caught in the crossfire.

Too often seen as agents of imposition by local communities, forcing on them remote rules and allocations.

Yet, paradoxically, at the same time, characterised by applicants as 'nay-sayers' and part of a slow, expensive system that has even led the profession to be painted, as Richard said, as the ""enemies of enterprise"".

You just can't win.

The challenge for the profession is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to cause both prejudices to be shed.

To make sure planning is seen as a crucial service operating in the public interest.

In the bluntest terms, as a force for good.

How should this look?

First, under the reformed planning system, the required demeanour is positive. The new arrangements including, above all, the presumption in favour of sustainable development, put the emphasis on seeking out opportunities for growth.

Second, it will place new demands on your skills in community leadership, forging relationships with local people and communities.

As Paula Ridley said earlier today, this means turning things around so that communities become the client for planners and councils.

The challenge will be to use your expertise and your skills to find ways for communities themselves to say 'yes' to sustainable growth, and to help them recognise that good planning and sustainable development can be the means to enhance and improve the places that they care for.

Third, for those in business, it obviously prizes a kind of relationship between businesses and communities. The most savvy developers are already there - Taylor Wimpey is but one housebuilder that has thought hard about the challenge of localism, changing their practices and approach.

Those who get localism know that they will succeed by working with communities in creative, progressive and sometimes, unexpected ways. But, as for those whose business model has relied on using regional strategies to dictate to local communities rather than engage with them, I predict that they will find that, without change, a toxic local reputation will prove an impediment to success.

I think there is a challenge, too, to the profession as it is organised.

I was a strategy consultant and strategy consultancies are notorious for not being terribly strategic in the way they run themselves.

If I look at the planning profession, I sometimes think it has been slow to see change coming, and indeed has almost been taken by surprise by it, rather than anticipating and shaping that change to the maximum extent possible. In other words, paradoxically, it hasn't always been in this respect that good at planning!

Too often it has been commenting on others' proposals rather than seizing the initiative and shaping the change itself.

If I could give one example, the Institute's manifesto published last April was an encapsulation of the status quo - not so much a plan for the future, more of a defence of the present.

And this at a time when two major political parties were calling for fundamental, root and branch reforms.

As Richard and Trudie have said, I think that things have improved.

As I mentioned, the RTPI's input on the duty to cooperate has been very effective.

Similarly, there have been plenty of instances of outstanding individuals putting their ideas forward and seeking to shape change.

I think in particular of John Rhodes and Simon Marsh, one half of the quartet of expert practitioners who drew up informed proposals for the draft for the National Planning Policy Framework - a much simpler and more forceful way of expressing the values that planning aims to uphold.

In our official draft framework, which we aim to publish next month, we will seek to emulate their concision - they have shown what can be done by getting on and doing it rather than theorising about it.

This is a Government determined to make policy in different ways.

No-one has a monopoly on wisdom.

We will have an Open Source Approach; we want people to suggest the answers to the questions as well as just raising questions.

Some individuals and organisations are jumping at the chance.  For example, the RICS have put up their hand to write some of the revised and more concise guidance that will accompany the slimmed-down planning policy. I would hope very much that the RTPI, with its huge wealth of expertise and experience, would also be keen to play a leading role in that process.

The next year is going to be the most crucial for British planning in half a century.

By next June, we will, quite simply, be in a whole new world.

The Localism Act will be in place.

The Infrastructure Planning Commission will be gone.

Ministers will be taking decisions on major infrastructure projects.

The regional tier of governance will be gone.

The duty to co-operate will be in force.

Communities will have the right to take up neighbourhood planning.

A new simpler radically more concise National Planning Policy Framework will be guiding the hand of planners and decision-makers.

The presumption in favour of sustainable development will be in force.

This is nothing less than a new settlement for the planning system.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/1862011,A review of coalfields regeneration: government response,"* * *

The Minister for Housing and Local Government (The Rt Hon Grant Shapps): In 2010 the previous government initiated a Review of Coalfields Regeneration to help inform future policy in this area and the review chaired by Michael Clapham was completed in September last year. This response sets out the Coalition Government's commitment to provide continuing support to communities in these areas and to make locally led regeneration the central feature of the new approach, driving growth and helping local leaders to strengthen their economic potential and support communities.

The Clapham Review found that some communities were still in need of specific intervention in tackling the key continuing inequalities of the coalfield areas. They had a need for continued provision of targeted coalfields funding and for that funding to be more effectively coordinated. The Review also suggested that local authorities should have a central role to play in the next phase of coalfields regeneration, and that a small grants or loans scheme was needed to help businesses struggling to access funding in the current economic climate.

Government welcomes the review and accepts the strong case it makes for targeted support to help the most challenged coalfield areas achieve a basis on which they can go forward as self sustaining communities. The Government is committed to helping local communities in overcoming health and skills inequalities and in developing the leadership to drive forward their own plans for economic growth and community renewal. The overriding need to reduce expenditure nationally to help tackle the fiscal deficit means that funding will be less than in the past. It will need to be closely targeted at the most deprived areas and in helping communities to develop plans which are not reliant on public subsidy in the future. Government will invest in realistic plans for locally led growth intended over time to bring coalfield areas up to the levels of economic activity in the adjoining areas.

The response sets out measures in four key areas:

  * funding for the Coalfields Regeneration Trust, with a total of £30m over two years and potential for further funding in years three and four as part of transition to a self funded body. This will enable it to lead a new Partnership Programme for coalfield areas to focus on key issues including health inequalities and community support and to continue to support small projects in individual communities;
  * funding of around £150m to complete over time remaining investment projects in the HCA Coalfields programme which are commercially realistic and in line with local priorities;
  * giving local authorities greater flexibilities and a key role in determining priorities for local HCA investment and advising on asset transfers;
  * creating a new small business start up fund as part of the Coalfield Regeneration Trust programme working with Enterprise Fund and other coalfields partners to provide small loans to business start ups in the most challenged areas.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

Tomorrow, I am off to see how the great city of Birmingham is creating jobs, attracting businesses and promoting growth.

People say that what happens in Birmingham affects the whole West Midlands.

I don't think so - no what happens in Birmingham affects the whole world.

Birmingham is a world city as important as Boston or Barcelona.

It is a global player, but one playing with its hands tied behind its back.

It was not always so.

Once Joseph Chamberlain ran Birmingham.

That giant city leader.

Introduced primary education.

Cleaned up the water supply.

Built libraries, schools, and museums.

It was the same in Manchester. The same in Leeds  And the same in my old stomping ground of Bradford.

Visit one of those Victorian city halls and you can feel a citadel to civic pride, civic duty and independence.

No waiting for approval from Parliament - much less an instruction manual.

They knew what they wanted to do - but they also had the powers and just got on with it.

It's no surprise that as powers have been leeched from local government, English cities have declined and stagnated.

The old initiative, the old dynamism, the spirit of activism has all been snatched away.

Much of the energy of modern city leadership is drained away dealing with TLAs - three letter acronyms.

MAAs, LAAs, RSSs.

Can you imagine Joseph Chamberlain sitting meekly filling in forms so that some remote civil servant could measure his performance?

Everything that this Government is about is about putting power back where it belongs in City, County and Town Halls.

Back in the hands of local leaders - to have a real ownership over the issues which matter. Housing. Planning. Health and public services.

I am not advocating some kind of Back to the Future municipal power.

We need to go even further - ""Chamberlain plus"" by also empowering communities and individuals. Enabling them to solve their own problems. Offering a reason to get involved and make a difference to civic life.

We are giving cities back their political freedom - their ability to decide for themselves what they want.

So, for example, all councils will now have this power of general competence - the ability to do what ever they want in the interests of local people.

Major cities can go even further and decide for themselves whether they want to go for the leadership of a Mayor.

There is a reason why almost every major city in the world has a strong and powerful executive leader.

What works for Chicago could work for Coventry. What works for Lisbon could work for Leicester.

We're also forging a new democratic settlement for London.

So that the Mayor has the powers to match his international profile.

And so that Londoners have real influence over the decisions which affect their lives.

Like regeneration, housing investment and the Olympic legacy.

These decisions are being wrested away from quangos and bureaucrats and put back where they belong - in the hands of Londoners.

But as well as political autonomy, cities have also got to have the economic freedom to go with it.

What we've had in recent decades is completely unstable and unbalanced economic growth.

Some places have been left far behind - with the public sector picking up the slack; further unbalancing the local economy away from the enterprise that should be its life blood.

Cities are sometimes described as the engine of economic growth, all governments recognise that.

In furtherance of that belief, over the past decade or so, government's well intentioned but unsteady hand has systematically poured sugar into that engine - stifling it of life.

You can't create jobs around the country by coming up with a masterplan from Whitehall.

You can't support businesses by drawing artificial lines on a map and calling them 'regions'.

So we are putting the decisions on growth in the hands of the people who know and understand their own natural economic area - through local enterprise partnerships.

Local business leaders alongside local elected officials, coming together in their own ways to to devise their own solutions - without being drowned in guidance and paperwork.

The people of Birmingham, Cambridge or Bristol should be deciding what their economic future looks like - based on their industries, circumstances and strengths.

It has been encouraging to see the way that cities have responded to this opportunity. Like Sheffield - no longer forced into the box marked ""Yorkshire and the Humber"" and having to follow instructions from Leeds.

It is now working in partnership across a much more natural economic area, bringing in parts of Derbyshire and the National Park, as well as private businesses.

We are looking at three levers for growth.

First, partnerships can bid for a share of the billion and a half pound growth fund - helping to create private sector jobs and attract businesses investment.

Second, there is the new homes bonus for councils who want to support local families and attract new workers.

It will make sure that local people are rewarded, not penalised, for development in their area.

And third, there are the ideas we have for reforming business rates.

It seems crazy to me that English councils have no financial incentives to invest in economic growth.

We are examining ways to give authorities a real financial incentive to encourage business and a spirit of enterprise.

But we're already announced plans to let councils borrow against future business rates.

And we are now looking at much more radical options - keeping more of the proceeds and moving towards a much greater degree of self financing.

But perhaps one of the biggest blockades to growth over recent decades has been the planning system.

Well, we call it the planning system.

We haven't had proper planning in this country for decades.

Instead we just had development control.

We've ended up with a confrontational system, founded on mistrust and a sense of powerlessness.

Which dreamed up targets instead of making sure that homes got built.

The new planning system is predicated on encouraging growth - there will be a powerful presumption in favour of stainable development.

Planning will be plan led rather than the current default setting of appeal on application.

We are borrowing from Germany and elsewhere with our emphasis on neighbourhood planning.

Some people mistakenly think this is a policy which has been designed for rural villages.

No. Neighbourhood planning is equally applicable to the urban setting.

The whole point about localism is that it enables any community, where-ever it is, whatever its circumstances, to make its own choices for growth.

The building blocks of great cities are strong and cohesive neighbourhoods - where people have a strong sense of belonging and pride.

Those neighbourhoods should be able to come together and say, this is what we want our community to look like in five, ten, twenty years time.

Far from being a NIMBY's charter - this is a way of giving people a reason to say 'yes' to growth.

Confident that this is their neighbourhood. Their city. And their choices about their future.

Through localism, I believe that we can unleash the potential which we all believe is latent in our cities.

We can restore their political autonomy, their economic freedom, and their financial independence.

If we want our cities to be able to compete on the global stage, then we have to start locally.

There used to be a saying: what Manchester does today, the world does tomorrow.

Every single city should aspire to replacing Manchester in that sentence.

There are few limits to their new powers.

There should be no limits to their ambition.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Haberdashers' Hall, London",,,,19-Jan-2011,,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

The moment some children are born their life chances are simply written off.

From day one their lives are defined by the problems that surround them.

Drugs. Alcohol. Crime. Mental illness. Unemployment. They grow up in chaos and their own lives are chaotic.

During the summer riots the common refrain was, where are the parents? Why aren't they keeping their kids indoors? Why weren't they with them in court?  
   
The whole country got a sudden, unwelcome insight into our problem families. The ones that make misery in their communities and cause misery to themselves.

Any local politician worth his salt will already know the family members by name - along with the police, the social workers, the courts, the schools, the A&E. And they will be known and avoided in their local neighbourhoods.

There are 120,000 plus of these problem families.

And there hasn't been a lack of interventions. A lack of money spent. Less than one per cent of the population, they cost the economy over eight billion pounds a year.

It's a story of futility and waste. Waste of money. Waste of people.

And it has simply got to stop. We are going to stop it.

We can no longer afford the luxury of fruitless, uncoordinated investment. The damaged lives and communities.

The Prime Minister has set out an ambition of turning the lives of these families around by the end of Parliament.

I'm in charge of delivering this across Whitehall.

And someone's got to show local leadership to deliver this on the ground. And that should be you in local government.

So don't dither or fret. Um and ah. Don't pass the buck. This is it.

Last week the Prime Minister announced a Troubled Families Unit in my Department led by Louise Casey.

She will be working on an action plan for what needs to be done nationally and locally to deliver this ambition. That will include cutting the bureaucracy that gets in your way.

And she'll be supporting and talking to you. To ensure that all across the country, councils and their partners are prioritising the activities and interventions which work.

If you're wondering is this a threat to your independence - the answer is yes, it is a threat. It is a threat if you don't get on with things.

Think of this as a race to deliver by 2015. If you motor along then we'll play catch up. But if we get there first - you'll find yourselves behind the agenda.

And I'm sorry about people who tell me they've already got a programme that deals with this. Well, if it was all dealt with we wouldn't be here.

One or two projects along the right lines isn't nearly enough to solve this problem.

So be in no doubt - we are in a hurry, we mean to deliver.

You don't need to talk about it or show empathy. I want you to get on with it.

And I know local government can get results. But understand - this isn't either or. We are going to deliver on this.

So get moving.

Louise is starting at the end of this month.

And you need to be well on your way to getting a plan worked out by Christmas.

Don't think even think about putting up your Christmas tree unless you've got that plan - not a single bauble. If Santa's already come calling then it's too late.

You need to know:

  * Who are your families?
  * What do they cost?
  * What are your interventions?
  * What is working?

You won't get off a first base if you don't know this.

You've got to dare to share.

That's what they say in Salford. Where you've got the doctors, the dentists, the social workers, the Job Centres, the police all agreeing to share key information.

This is a massive, crucial culture change - sharing data automatically. And it's got to be driven from the top.

And don't moan to me that people won't co-operate, just do it. Don't say there are bureaucratic obstacles - we'll remove them.

For too long everyone from the police to the social workers to health care professionals have worked in isolation.

Up to twenty local agencies are involved with the same family - costing local services up to £330,000 per family every year.

It's expensive. It's ineffective. Agencies overlap and pull in different directions. Families get pushed from pillar to post and feel like no one's on their side.

It's a bad deal all round.

In contrast one co-ordinated and integrated intervention that's better for families - can cost around £14,000. Meaning yearly costs plummet by around £70,000 for each family.

The message here is simple: stop throwing money away and get coordinated.

And don't just tick the boxes. It's not about just getting in touch with a family. Engaging with them.

We need action and results - not endless restating the problems.

You don't get answers by repeating the question enough times.

We know we've got a problem. We've analysed.  We've seen it. Now we've got to do something about it.

Like getting kids back to schools, adults into employment, stopping criminal behaviour.

I've heard about an approach where intervention can start in the dentist's chair when a fistfight leads to broken teeth. It's a great dentist that cares about your family life as well as your teeth.

I'm glad to see over 70 of you have signed up to use a Community Budget approach to problem families which is all about bringing the people and the resources together. Fitting the solution around the problem instead of visa versa.

I know my colleague Baroness Hanham has done some intensive work with many of you over the summer. Looking at what barriers were getting in the way of ambitious Community Budgets.

Look online today and see their work. Including a definitive and practical data sharing guide - led by Greater Manchester partners to point you in the right direction.

This is a tough agenda - tough for me and tough for you.

But when you look at the pictures in your municipal halls of your predecessors, think - you're going to do what they couldn't.

They couldn't crack this but you're going to crack it.

I believe that you can deliver on this agenda.

And that's because I know when you unchain local agencies from Whitehall bureaucracy - it adds up to local energy, local initiative and local innovation.

I also want to talk to you today about the next stage of the localism agenda. The next phase of Community Budgets.

This is about putting you in a position to really deliver your ideas.

It's money and power to you.

We've always said in order to make localism a reality, greater legal freedom needs to go hand in hand with greater freedom over finances.

So we're supporting the creation of four locally led pilots:

Two Community Budgets for neighbourhoods. That will be co-designed by local people. Looking at what public services from safety to health can be managed at neighbourhood level.

And two Community Budgets for a whole area. That bring together all funding for local services into one place. A single budget. That will get to the heart of what barriers stop you from controlling the purse strings.

We've published a Prospectus today and you might be thinking this looks as dull as dishwater.

That's because it is as dull as dishwater.

You see we didn't want to frighten the rest of Whitehall off. If they'd given me something more exciting I'd have had to tell them to dull it down.

But you can take it and run with it. Flesh it out, give it bones, put blood in its veins.

In fact make it the thumping heart of your community.

Because this is your opportunity to change the future of the way public services are funded.

Test your ambitions to the limit.

And the old hands in Whitehall won't realise they've lost control until it's too late.

If you need to ask how to use this then you're not up to it - stand down and let someone else try.

But bid for this and it'll be the best thing you've ever done.

And while these places forge ahead - the rest of you need to make sure you're not left behind.

If you have ideas to organise services better - let's hear them. If you need more freedom over budgets - make your case.

I can't guarantee that Government will give you everything you want but I can guarantee we'll listen.

Nothing is off the table.

Push us.

Challenge us.

The Minister for Housing and Local Government (The Rt Hon Grant Shapps): Further to my Written Statement of 9 December 2010, I am today announcing the publication of the Framework for the Government's Affordable Homes Programme for 2011-15. This document is published jointly by my Department and the Homes and Communities Agency.

The Affordable Homes Programme is designed to support the delivery of up to 150,000 new affordable homes through a mixture of new investment (some £4.5bn over the next four years) and greater flexibility for social housing providers to make the best use of existing and future assets. The new Affordable Rent model, which will be the principal element of the Programme, will make public subsidy go further while also enabling local authorities and providers to target support where it is most needed.  
     
The Framework document invites offers from providers who are interested in participating in the Programme. The full document is available at: [www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/affordable-homes](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/affordable-homes) (external link).

In parallel, my Right Hon. Friend the Minister for Decentralisation has today launched a consultation on a technical revision to Annex B of Planning Policy Statement 3 to make clear that Affordable Rent falls within the definition of affordable housing for planning purposes. The consultation document is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/pps3annexconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/pps3annexconsultation).

In addition, to give providers more certainty over future income, I have today confirmed that the existing inflation-linked formula for annual rent increases in social rented housing will continue to apply throughout the 2011-15 period, as part of the Government's rent restructuring policy.

Further to my [Written Statement of 14 February](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/affordablehomes), I am today announcing the outcomes of the Homes and Communities Agency's invitation for proposals for Affordable Rent under the Government's Affordable Homes Programme for 2011-15.

The Affordable Homes Programme, which I launched on 9 December 2010, was designed to support the delivery of up to 150,000 new affordable homes through a mixture of new investment (some £4.5 billion over the next four years) and greater flexibility for social housing providers to make the best use of existing and future assets. The new Affordable Rent model, which will be the principal element of the Programme, will make public subsidy go further while enabling local authorities and providers to target support where it is most needed.  
   
When I launched the invitation for bids under the Framework in February, I said that my aspiration was to deliver more than 150,000 new affordable homes, and challenged the sector to deliver. The response from providers to the invitation for proposals under this Programme has exceeded my original expectations, and I now believe that we will be able to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes. The programme I am announcing today includes around 80,000 homes for affordable rent or affordable home ownership, supported by funding of £1.8 billion from the Government.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

### Introduction

Thank you to Robert Peto for your very kind introduction and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors for hosting this event this morning.

Last time I was here as Shadow Minister to launch a collection of my speeches.

Old habits die hard - in a speech last week I made the mistake of calling myself the Shadow Housing Minister.

As one of my staff cruelly pointed out - ""Minister, you spent longer as a **shadow** than Cliff Richard!""

But I'm finally here and it's great to be able to talk to you today on a subject I am passionate about.

Something that is at the heart and soul of this Government - **aspiration**.

### Aspiration

Now, my predecessor famously said that falling levels of home ownership were 'not such a bad thing'.

I've asked RICS to host this event to make clear from the outset that I believe that **home ownership is a very good thing**.

In fact I will work every day to help people achieve their aspirations to own their home.

Of course I am not arguing that everyone should somehow aspire to home ownership.

Renting a home can be a positive and flexible choice.

And social housing provides a sense of security for millions of families.

**I am simply saying to those who aspire to own their own home -**

  * **This Government will support you**
  * **You will not be ignored**
  * **The age of aspiration is back!**

There are an estimated 1.4 million households who aspire to own a home but are unable to do so because of house prices and mortgage availability.

There are hundreds of thousands of people in rented accommodation, or living with parents, who yearn to be first time buyers.

It is now true that the average age of first time buyer (with no support from their family) is 37.

Now that 37 year old is not asking for a hand-out they just want a chance.

We need to give them that opportunity.

### Sound economic management

The best thing we can do for the all-important First Time Buyer is to get the economy back onto a sound footing.

This Coalition is prepared to take the tough decisions needed to make that happen.

The Prime Minister said yesterday that his number one priority is to deal with the country's massive deficit.

As he put it; if we don't, we run the risk of much higher interest rates. But it's not just that they will be higher:

It's that they'll climb faster - and further - and sooner and stay high for longer -  if we don't act immediately.

We've made a good start with over £6 billion in savings for this year. George Osborne is sending a strong signal to the markets that we're very serious about tackling head on the huge financial challenges we face.

We will need to work together across the housing market - builders and surveyors, lenders and brokers, Regulators and agents - to ensure that the conditions which created the housing bubbles of the past are never repeated.

But there are still difficult adjustments to be made and I know that market confidence remains fragile.

There is a risk that the market may not respond to changing conditions quickly enough, leaving creditworthy borrowers still out in the cold.

I see responsible lending and responsible borrowing as two sides of the same coin.

Borrowers will need to demonstrate financial responsibility and show that they can sustain homeownership.

In return lenders will need to support creditworthy homeowners.  I know the housing market is still fragile but we in Government will do all we can to help.

We've already taken quick and decisive action to make HIPs history.

Expensive and bureaucratic Home Information Packs increased the cost and hassle of selling homes. We have ripped up red-tape that was strangling the Housing Market recovery.

A move that has already started to have an impact - the number of homes coming to market immediately jumping by a third.

The Coalition Government has also agreed to promote shared ownership schemes and help social tenants and others to own or part-own their home.

### Housebuilding

But if we are really serious about supporting people's aspiration for home ownership, the real prize is we must build more homes.

In that booklet of speeches I launched here earlier this year, I sympathised with my predecessors in this job, saying:

> ""Ordered to deliver 3m homes by 2020 - it was just a race against time for this week's hapless housing minister to make something … anything …happen … before the inevitable reshuffle.
> 
> ""So higher targets … louder diktats … a bigger stick and more legislation to create strange sounding Quangos designed to deliver on the Government's housing targets … RSS's … the HCA … RDAs … EEDA … SEDA … EERA … NERA.
> 
> As the latest housing minister pulled the levers of state, he or she pushed the people further away.""

And now, I am that Minister with my hand on the levers.

And I'm determined to deliver.

So in place of those meaningless targets - we will introduce powerful incentives.

In place of centralisation - I will devolve power.

In place of expensive Quangos - we will trust people.

I'm going to release those centralised levers that don't work anyway - and as I do, I am certain an extraordinary thing will happen.

The more power we give away - the more people will act to generate real change.

For the first time incentives will create direct benefits for local communities. Bringing jobs, investment and yes - more homes for local people.

Rather than being told what to build and where -  residents of villages, towns and cities will be able to develop their own vision for their place.

We'll introduce Local Housing Trusts. Enabling communities to create new housing for local people.

We understand that the transition to a more open, transparent and democratic planning system is not entirely anxiety-free for many involved.

But we know that there is no future in this centrally planned system which has so dramatically failed, delivering fewer homes now than during any peacetime year since 1924.

By unleashing the aspirations of communities as well as individuals to build homes where and when they are needed, we will bring about greater certainty.

Certainty that will replace the conflict caused by imposing housing numbers from right here in Whitehall.

Certainty that will give investors confidence to invest.

### Conclusion

The last thing we need is a return to the house price boom and bust of recent years.

Falling prices are bad for homeowners and builders alike, whilst soaring prices freeze out first time buyers.

So, we need to build more homes and entrench sensible lending practices so that, in the long run, houses will become more affordable.

That's our aim: a stable housing market that gives both home buyers and builders a solid base to invest for the future.

Homeownership has provided personal and financial security to millions of people in the UK, including (I am almost certain) the majority of this audience.

I do not believe that it is right to deny the benefits of homeownership, that we have enjoyed, to the next generation.

And this new Government is not in the business of pouring cold water on people's aspirations.

Of course I know many analysts predict further short or medium-term falls in homeownership.

And given the appalling financial legacy left to us - they could be right.

But it is not good enough to simply say ""this may be a good thing.""

I believe that it is human nature to aspire to shelter and security - and for the many that means owning the roof over your own head.

And I don't consider it my job as Housing Minister to hold those aspirations back.

With a new Government and despite the enormous financial difficulties the country faces I want to state clearly today:

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

### Opening

Thank you for inviting me to speak here. Estate and property efficiency in the public sector is something in which I have taken a keen interest through the work my Department has done on the Capital and Assets Pathfinder project, which I chair.

Public sector borrowing currently stands at £149bn, we are spending £120m a day on interest. We must all find ways of cutting the highest deficit in the UK's peacetime history and ensure financial recovery. The Budget last week builds on the action announced in the Spending Review to rebalance the economy from unsustainable public spending towards exports and investment.

Eric Pickles announced yesterday at Capita's Community Budgets conference that the 16 first phase Community Budgets are now in place tackling families with multiple problems.

This is a key initiative assisting areas to deliver more with less by tackling funding and other barriers to delivery of efficient and effective services that cross organisational boundaries. I will be working with Leaders from these areas to tackle the key issues and barriers that impact on the scale and pace of development of Community Budgets.

### How the Spending Review will affect public sector asset management

You will have heard from Patrick Blogg earlier about the Capital and Asset Pathfinder approach and the significant potential savings which have been identified.

Many authorities are now recognising the benefits that can be achieved from good asset management, which include the release of capital funds for reinvestment.

By using some of the money released to increase the energy efficiency of the existing built estate energy costs could be reduced by around £500m per year, emissions reduced by 3.3m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, and green jobs created.

There are also revenue benefits; by reducing running costs, we estimate that rationalising the estate could cut the maintenance backlog bill by 25 per cent over ten years.

The relocation and co-location of services can greatly improve the convenience for residents in an area. Fewer buildings does not mean poorer services. There are numerous examples at a local level - in the Capital and Assets Pathfinders and elsewhere - suggesting there is an appetite not merely to co-locate staff but to integrate services according to function rather than organisation. This provides exciting and interesting opportunities to improve coherence in policy areas which overlap organisational boundaries - for example, adult social care - and bring related benefits to communities.

In one of the Capital and Assets Pathfinder areas, Worcestershire, local residents are actively involved in determining which local services are to be provided from which properties. Communities are being empowered to help design service provision. Assets are being rationalised but services are being tailored towards the needs and convenience of residents.

The Capital and Asset Pathfinders project has been exploring how we can remove barriers to collaborative working at a local level, for example through identifying where public sector assets are and what services they are being used for.

We will publish this information through a demonstrator map later this year to show the potential for opportunities in an area. Managing a larger estate collectively increases flexibility, allowing organisations to shrink or grow depending on their needs.

We are also bringing together national public sector agencies, such as the Land Registry, the Valuation Office Agency and the NHS, to see if we can create a longer term sustainable map of the public sector estate.

The Capital and Assets Pathfinders have come up against a number of barriers at a local level which we are working across Whitehall to overcome. For example, Wigan and Cambridgeshire both faced difficulties in progressing co-location plans with their local Job Centre Plus'. At the national level the Department for Work and Pensions is interested in progressing projects that will release savings and we have now agreed a structure for local areas to approach the Department for Work and Pensions where the inward or outward co-location of staff involving Job Centre Plus buildings is concerned (all are owned by a private company, Trillium, rather than the Department for Work and Pensions). This will be promulgated to Job Centre Plus managers and to local authorities who want to adopt this approach.

And we are working with The Local Government Group on its Place Based Productivity programme. This programme has the potential to help local areas with ideas and strategies to bridge the gap in funding, work more collaboratively and transform local public services.

We are making good progress with our Pathfinder areas. However, success will depend on encouraging other local leaders to follow suit.

Another area for greater collaboration is the transfer of assets to community management or ownership. In this morning's session, one of my officials, Charles Woodd, set out the benefits of increasing community ownership of assets and the way local authorities have increasingly recognised the value of community asset transfer as one option in the consideration of asset management and disposal strategies.

With the Localism Bill, we are taking this on to the next stage, by giving communities much greater opportunity to take the initiative. They will be able to identify assets of community value they want the local authority to list, so that they will have a chance to bid to buy them if the owner decides to sell. We intend this to apply to both public and private assets, and to level the playing field when public bodies decide to dispose of assets.

The Bill will also give voluntary and community bodies and others the opportunity to challenge local authorities by expressing an interest in running a service they feel they can do differently and better, so that they can bid if the authority agrees to initiate a procurement process.

### The mandate for centralised procurement, ensuring a joined up approach to property decisions

I believe it is the wrong response at this time of strained financial resource for councils to panic and salami slice services. Instead, they should explore ways of doing things differently. There is also the potential to save up to 10 per cent on procurement costs through the public sector working collaboratively.

### How the new property vehicles pilot will manage Government estate better and its proposed national roll out

Central government is looking at how it too can reduce the costs of its estate. The Department for Communities and Local Government has been taking stock of how to manage its diminishing property requirements, partly as a result of the abolition of the government offices and regional development agencies, alongside the centralisation of government property management under the Government Property Unit in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

The Spending Review last year announced a new, two-pronged, approach to managing the Government property estate, led by the Government Property Unit: National Property Controls and the setting up of Property Vehicle pilots for the Central London and Bristol office estates from 2011-12.

They will manage the estate strategically, achieving more efficient use of the property assets, as well as work with Departments to reduce their estates and maximise the commercial potential of their property portfolios.

Property Vehicles will initially focus on the Central Civil estate, and in particular on the two pilots in Central London and Bristol. Throughout 2011-12 these pilots will be about trialling solutions, delivering quick wins, demonstrating success, and ensuring the important seeds are sown to tackle inherent inefficiencies that exist.

### Closing

Knowing that economies of scale are possible will not ease the pressure on front line services if local authorities don't establish collaborative processes, and take a hard close look at their own estate, and those of other public bodies in their area. Coordination of property and realignment of services is a profitable way forward.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Many thanks to Localis for hosting us today. Localis are a think-tank on local matters who have made national politicians sit up and pay attention on issues from town hall finance, to personalising public services, to cutting back regulation.

Your director Alex Thomson helped shape many of the ideas in ""Open Source Planning"" which have, in turn, influenced the proposals in the coalition agreement.

I'm delighted that Tom Shakespeare, the Localis director of policy, has kindly stepped in to give the response today.

Today, I want to talk about this government's proposals for planning: how we can make the system straightforward and transparent: how we can restore democratic control, the better to respond to local need; and how we can unblock the system to make it more effective at fulfilling its essential role of enabling sustainable development.

In short, how we can reboot planning to meet the needs of the 21st century.

My starting point is an appreciation of the value of planning. TS Eliot said that ""literary criticism is a distinctive activity of the civilised mind.""  For me, planning is a distinctive activity of a civilised society.

I spoke about this when I met the Royal Town Planning Institute earlier this year:

> ""[Planning] shapes the world in which new generations live and work - and makes it better than it would otherwise be. The places where children grow up, that will stay with them forever. The workplaces where thousands of people spend thousands of daylight hours. The places we look forward to going home to in the evening.
> 
> ""It is, when you think about it, an awesome responsibility.""

Planning, at its best, makes places of which the people who live and work there can be truly proud.

I do not come to this role with a uniform view of what the built environment should look like. In fact I admire some things that are rather unfashionable at present.

On one on my walls is a print of Tunbridge Wells in 1719. You can see the first colonnaded shops and coffee shops that still draw tens of thousands of visitors each year.

On another is a photograph of Le Corbusier's Unite d'Habitation going up in Marseille, one of the thrilling landmarks of modernism.

It is not central government's role to stifle new ideas, but to allow for the exercise of imagination and creativity.

In other terms, there is space enough in planning for radicalism and continuity, and they won't happen everywhere at the same time.

My other starting assumption is that is the role of the planning system to set standards that enable the right kind of growth - not to hamper all growth indiscriminately.

I don't want to set the country in aspic. Nor do my colleagues in government. Britain is a growing country. There are already places where young people are simply unable to find a home in the towns where they grew up, families who need more room to grow. Projections suggest that a quarter of a million new households will be formed each year over the next two decades. The bottom line is simple: we need more homes.

At the same time, Britain faces unprecedented financial challenges. After a sharp recession, it is essential to reinvigorate the economy. Any successful business needs room to expand. And all businesses would benefit from the development of better national infrastructure to underpin fast and efficient transport, and reliable and affordable energy supplies.

In blunt terms, planning should enable, rather than impede, the right kind of development that our communities and businesses are crying out for.

The trouble is that in recent years we have seen too much of planning at its worst.

It's tempting for politicians, when they first take office, to seize control - to centralise power - with a view to improve people's lot and deliver the policies on which they were elected. That applies as much to health and education as it does to building new homes for a growing population, and creating space for new businesses and jobs.

But the law of unintended consequences applies. Over time, as the red tape has piled up, and the volume of central prescription and guidance has crept higher and higher, flawed policies have resulted in a planning system that is profoundly dysfunctional.

First, the current system is costly and bureaucratic. The desire to control from the centre has meant that guidance, planning policy statements and circulars have mushroomed. Currently, they total more than 7000 pages. Little wonder that non-experts struggle to orient themselves. The system costs applicants £750m per year in consultants and legal fees.

Second, the current planning system imposes on people in a way that breeds resentment. Regional spatial strategies imposed housing targets from above, with the result that many local communities felt disaffected. The consultation on the South West regional strategy alone generated 35,000 written objections. Research by IPSOS Mori uncovered simmering dissatisfaction:

> ""I feel powerless - what can we do?""

Frustration means that some people's response is to resist development at all costs. Yet the paradox is that the same IPSOS Mori research reveals that people want to see more homes built, especially affordable homes and small developments.

This highlights the most fundamental failing of all in the current system: it doesn't do the job it's supposed to. As we all know, In 18th century Russia, Gregor Potyomkin, one of Catherine the Great's advisors, took her on a boat tour of his estates. Catherine may have been fooled by the cardboard cut-outs of factories and schools and hospitals he had put up along the side of the river - but no-one else was. There's a parallel to be drawn with regional spatial strategies. It would be a big mistake to confuse targets on paper with homes actually built. If anything, the evidence might suggest an inverse relationship between the two. We now have the lowest level of house-building in peacetime since 1924.

The evidence also suggests that commercial and industrial development have declined over the last 20 years. This is matched by concern among businesses - expressed by the CBI, the Engineering Employers Federation and the British Chambers of Commerce and others - that the shortcomings of the planning system are undermining our economic prospects and our ability to attract inward investment.

In sum, the current system doesn't deliver for communities, it doesn't deliver for business, and it doesn't deliver for the country.

This government has a positive vision for the future of planning. We want to restore democratic control at every level. We want to make the system more straightforward, less costly, and easier to understand. And above all, we want an approach to local planning that is more genuinely local.

In essence, the challenge of local planning is to resolve the different interests of people who have homes - and those who need them; of the people who live next door to the business that wants to grow - and the people who might work there.

The last government resorted to imposition - this government believes in participation.

The last government used to take responsibility and assume control - we want to give people real choices, and enable them to see the real consequences of those choices.

When people know that they will get proper support to cope with the demands of new development; when they have a proper say over what new homes will look like; and when they can influence where those homes go, they have reasons to say ""yes"" to growth. Certainly more reasons than when a regional plan is thrust upon hem.

In other terms - decentralisation does not come at the cost of development. Our proposals make both possible.

In some cases, fulfilling this vision means sweeping away the old apparatus. In our election manifesto and in the coalition agreement, we made clear from the outset our intention to abolish regional housing targets, and that intention stands.

But this Government's proposals are not restricted to removing failed structures. Equipping planning to meet the needs of 21st century Britain requires fundamental, wholesale change - and in some cases this will mean creating new rights and opportunities too.

In a parliamentary session full of devolutionary pieces of legislation, the Localism Bill is perhaps the most radical of all. It will lay many of the foundations for many necessary planning reforms.

With the Bill's publication imminent, I want to explain in some more detail how it will achieve those aims - and how, in tandem with other, non-legislative changes, it will improve the planning system from top to toe.

The starting point of our reforms is that many more of the benefits of development should be felt at a very local level.

When people can take their own decisions, and see the benefits, it allows for a more mature debate at a local level about the arguments for and against new development.

We have already outlined one principal means of rewarding and supporting places who want to encourage development.

It's called the new homes bonus, and we have begun consulting on proposals. We propose to match the additional council tax raised over the following six years for new homes and properties brought back into use. There will be an additional amount for affordable homes. This will let the communities most affected by new housing developments see the greatest benefits. Local authorities will need to lead the debate with their communities to determine how this money - which will come without strings attached - should best be spent to meet local priorities. It could support reductions in council tax charges; it could be invested in the redevelopment of the town centre; or it could pay for a new community centre.

Today I want to say a little more about a second means of recognising and rewarding development - the community infrastructure levy.

The Government sees the levy as an important tool. It is a means of ensuring that when developers build new homes or businesses, they make a proper contribution towards improving local infrastructure, reflecting the new demands created by that development - such as increased traffic, or rising demand for local services.

The levy offers four major advantages.

For developers, it gives greater certainty. Alongside the levy, government is tightening up the requests that local authorities can make of developers through planning agreements, or section 106 agreements, which, in future, will not refer to facilities and resources that bear no close relationship to the development in question. Instead, with the levy, developers will be able to propose projects knowing the rules of the game in advance, and with a much firmer idea of how much they will be asked to contribute.

The levy is an arrangement with proper local flexibility. Where sites are economically difficult to bring forward, authorities will be able to set the rate at a low level, to ensure new development can go ahead. Elsewhere, authorities will be able to set a higher rate, reflecting the existing higher demands on infrastructure. And our reforms will give local authorities significantly more flexibility to provide for payment by instalments and for payment in kind, to suit local circumstances and the needs of local developers. An independent assessor will check that rates are not set so unreasonably high that they deter all development.

Crucially, the levy will enable local communities to see the benefits of development. There will be a requirement in law that a meaningful proportion of money raised must go to people at a very local, neighbourhood level. Resistance to development is often fuelled by genuine concerns that the development will add extra pressure on local services. This proposal will ensure that people who live down the road from a new development, will not only see the additional infrastructure such as road improvements, new parks and play areas in their areas, but will also, as far as possible, put the decisions about what some of the money should go on into the hands of people in the neighbourhood themselves. In common with our proposals for the New Homes Bonus, this will help communities manage the impacts of development more effectively and give them more reason to accept development in the first place.

Finally, the levy will be much more transparent for local communities - both in terms of how much is raised and how much is spent. The existing system of developer contributions relies on private, and sometimes commercially confidential, contracts. The new system requires timely annual reporting of both income and expenditure, so local people and developers can see what levy money was spent on.

But we don't just want people at a very local level to see the benefits of planning decisions: we want them to have a far greater opportunity to make or influence those decisions themselves.

We want to enable neighbourhoods to exert more influence in the planning system than is currently possible. We aim to create a means for people to formulate their own plans about what their area should look like in five, ten, twenty years' time.

This is a rethinking of how planning operates - creating new pressures and powers that operate from the bottom up, rather than the top down.

The principle is simple. Local people come together and agree, ""this is what we want our area to look like. Here is where we want the new homes to go and how we want them designed; here is where we want new shops and offices; here are the green spaces we want to protect.""

We will have more to say about neighbourhood planning when we publish the Localism Bill.

Of course not everyone will want to draw up a neighbourhood plan. This doesn't mean that they don't care about changes to their area. So where there is no neighbourhood plan, we are backing up the community's right to be heard. When major developments are planned we are setting down in law that developers must consult local people before they make a planning application.

Responsible developers do this already - not just because it's the right thing to do - but because they recognise that involving local people may help win local support, and, in turn, give a better chance of securing consent. Setting out the requirement in law will put things right where developers don't.

With neighbourhood plans, we are defining a new basic building block of planning.

But not all planning can take place at that very local level. Neighbourhood plans don't replace wider, local plans. Nor do they diminish the importance of those local plans.

In fact, if anything, it's the opposite: neighbourhood planning is made easier where there is a good local plan in place, which sets out the priorities and development needs of a wider area in a coherent, consistent way.

That's why, in the Localism Bill, we want to make it easier for local authorities, involving their communities, to draw up local plans - and to give them greater discretion to do it in the way they want, by cutting out excessive central prescription.

We also recognise a larger than local element to planning. In many cases sensible planning works best across the administrative boundaries of local authorities: where significant numbers of people work in one council, for example, but live in another: where the plans for housing in one are predicated on the plans for new offices in the other.

If local authorities want to come together to pool planning powers, share sovereignty, in a greater shared interest, they may already do so. Indeed, some of the local authorities who have come together in Local Enterprise Partnerships are already considering doing just that.

We want all local authorities think about the opportunities here in a considered way - a new ""duty to cooperate"" will require neighbouring authorities to be ready to join forces in the interests of the people they represent.

Finally, we want to improve the national policy and national processes for planning.

I mentioned the guidance and policy which planners must take into account. Currently there are more than 150 circulars, good practice guides and planning policy statements. Taken together, they contain more words than either the Bible of the Complete Works of Shakespeare. I would be the first to acknowledge that planning requires specialist skill and knowledge, but over-prescription has made the system too opaque. These documents set out planning policy and guidance in so much detail, with so many priorities and so many factors to consider, that the result is internal contradiction, no clear set of priorities, and a great deal of paper produced at local level which no-one actually uses.

We have plans for a clearer, crisper set of policy guidance, which shows respect for the expertise and specialist knowledge that planners bring.

It is our intention that at the heart of that revised policy there should be a presumption in favour of sustainable development. Applicants should expect to see their proposals approved provided they are in line with neighbourhood plans, local plans and national policies - including, of course, provisions on climate change and environmental protection.

I look forward to discussing these, and other proposals, in further detail in the months to come, when the Localism Bill is published and begins to make its way through parliament.

But I finish on that point because it brings me back to where I started.

The right kind of development is nothing to be afraid of. Our aim is that these reforms should help Britain break out of the current housebuilding trough; enable commercial development so that businesses see the planning system not as a drawback but as an advantage; and lay the foundations for the beautiful, successful, thriving communities of the future.

Think of the great successes of planning. Major projects such as Edinburgh in the 18th century, or Welwyn Garden City in the early 20th. Smaller-scale developments in almost every town or village you can imagine. Places that have been well loved for centuries, that people still live and work in today, and that speak of local identity. This is what great planning can achieve; this is what our reforms will enable people to choose for themselves.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,"Localis, London",,,,18-Nov-2010,making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

![People sharing lunch at tables outside a pub on Battersea High Street for the Big Lunch 2010.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1650157.jpg)For many of us, eating together at the table is all too rare. We live in our own little boxes, go to work and pass people on our street or the tube without a glance or hello - how often do we take the opportunity to stop and talk to our neighbours and try to get to know them?

But this week over a million of you managed just that. Imagine this: a street full of people chatting and eating, with food available to taste from every continent - and a sense of revelry and good will in the air. This was the scene in streets and parks up and down the country - people coming together to break down barriers and eat lunch with each other.

I've been a proud supporter of the Big Lunch and what it's doing to bring communities closer together. Not only is it a fantastic way for people to eat together for its own sake, it has inspired a powerful sense of community and collective identity, so much needed in what has become an increasingly fractured and fragmented society. No doubt, these lunches have sparked new social connections. People who before didn't know who lived next door to them are now sharing the school run or helping out elderly neighbours. And overnight, the way people _feel_ and connect to their neighbourhoods has changed. And it's all started with the people in our very own streets.

This has been the greatest achievement of the Big Lunch, and something we as Government want to emulate in our vision for building the Big Society. We want strong communities, with a collective identity and community spirit that people can really connect with and feel part of. We want people to have a real say over what happens in their streets and communities, to voice their opinions on issues that really matter to them. We want people to care and take responsibility for the environment around them: their parks, their schools, their streets, their local bus services - and we will give them the power to do this. And with greater control and ownership comes a greater sense of belonging and connection. So everybody wins.

Because being an active part of the community is good for the soul. The more we give to our neighbourhoods, the more we get back. The more we gather together and talk about important issues such as crime and antisocial behaviour, the more effective we will be in finding local solutions to these problems.

We can transfer power and control from government to communities and individuals. And we've already started doing just that. But we also need individual people to play their part. We need you to get involved, to build networks and form groups with people around you, and to build relationships with those you might not normally mix with. And help build a stronger, more cohesive community around you.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

What makes a local area prosper?

What makes it tick?

Is it central government? Is it local government?

Of course in our hearts we would like to think so, but we know more often than not government is a hindrance.

What makes an area prosper is business and commerce.

Governments can print money.

Regional Development Agencies are really dandy at moving it around.

But only business and commerce makes money.

The British Chambers of Commerce are the heart and soul of British enterprise, champions of place and locality.

So I'm delighted to be given this opportunity to talk to you today about localism and growth.

I don't have any doubt at all that without your support we would not have got many of our new local enterprise partnerships off the ground.

As it is, 91 per cent of businesses, 21 million employees are now covered by local enterprise partnerships. This is a huge achievement in [three] months.

An indication that there was ambition and ideas that have been out there for such a long time - waiting to be heard.

This Government was clear of one thing when it came to fixing the economy. That it is better to work with the market than against it.

With these partnerships we're putting you and local leaders in the driving seat. Giving you the space and the freedom to come up with different ideas to meet the needs of your own areas.

We agreed it was crucial that local enterprise partnerships weren't council dominated. You said that the chair should be a business person and we've delivered; you said that business representation was crucial and we've made it a requirement that all boards must be at least 50 per cent business-led.

You told us that business doesn't think in terms of administrative areas. So we asked you to come together on the basis of real economic geography.

No artificially imposed regions - I believe that regional structures didn't properly reflect the shape of local economies.

It's you that decide the focus, the priorities for every area.

And we've kept things simple. No mountains of guidance on how to set up your local enterprise partnership. So these partnerships can be nimble and unfettered by the chains of bureaucracy.

Taking this forward I want you to be bold; I want you to be radical; I want you to be ambitious and you can tell us what should be done.

I'm seeing pace and momentum. The private sector is getting engaged - and I'm glad to see notable business leaders like Sir Terry Leahy and Sandy Anderson on the Boards of the Liverpool and Tees Valley partnerships. I'm also very pleased at today's announcement that Andy Street, Managing Director of John Lewis, will chair the Birmingham and Solihull local enterprise partnership.

Turning back to Tees Valley - they have already pooled their budgets for their partnership to allow them to work towards a diversified and higher value low carbon economy.

Stoke and Staffordshire brought over 200 key partners to their inaugural meeting - a very visible way of bringing together partnership work at this early stage.

And Coventry and Warwickshire are getting all the local banks together to make it easier for small businesses to access the finance they need to continue to thrive.

Today I want to challenge you to move faster and Zero-in on barriers to growth.

I am - of course - delighted that the British Chambers of Commerce are going to lead a new national network of local enterprise partnerships.

I'm particularly pleased that David [Frost] has agreed to chair. And we're putting some resources into this - £300,000 to get this network off the ground. I am also pleased that the British Chambers of Commerce will be supporting foreign direct investment, as part of the new contract with UK Trade and Industry and PA Consulting, and with their strong links to the local enterprise partnerships on the ground and through the new Network, British Chambers of Commerce has a really powerful role in helping to drive this country's growth.

I did think it was immensely important that the national network was not run by central government - as some proposed - or by local government, or by a quango but directly by commerce. I always felt you had the capacity but more than that it was psychologically important to have business in the lead.

And once up and running this network will give partnerships the opportunity to learn from one another and provide support amongst peers and competitors.

It's particularly important for partnerships that are moving slower or have less capacity. Helping them buck up their ideas. And catch up with the very best.

I know there have been calls for more guidance from us on local enterprise partnerships. Both from the public sector, which I expected, and more amazingly the private sector.

The irony that some of those who were demanding to be set free are now yearning for the certainty of the tick box and central dictat is not lost on me.

We have no intention of telling you what local enterprise partnerships have to be.

Me trying to second guess the business priorities for a local area would be the worst thing that could happen. We'd go straight back to the days of Whitehall choking off local initiative with its reams of guidance and heavy handed targets.

It's vital that partnerships are hitting the ground running, working things out for themselves.

The same goes for Enterprise Zones.

The core idea is that they stimulate growth and reduce the barriers to enterprise. And ideas need to come from the ground up.

Local enterprise partnerships will decide where the Enterprise Zone should be. And what they want to include in their Enterprise Zone package.

There's a pretty attractive menu of options already.

  * a business rate discount of up to 100 per cent for five years
  * all business rate growth generated by the Zone to be kept by the area for at least 25 years
  * Local Development Orders will be available to local authorities to establish a very simplified planning regime
  * the Government's support to ensure that super-fast broadband is rolled out throughout the Zones
  * government will also enable the use of Tax Increment Finance, borrowing against future business rates, to support the long term viability of the area
  * UK Trade and Industry will promote inward investment of trade opportunities for the Zones

I think of these Zones as being a little bit like a clothes horse - you can choose what you hang on them. As long as it's high on ambition and low on bureaucracy then it will work.

There will be common themes and goals across all the Zones, but it will be the differences between them that make them great.

I'm delighted by how quickly local enterprise partnerships have responded to the call for action on Enterprise Zones. Some named sites already and there are more to come.

They were chosen on the basis of ideas and innovation and the work is already going forward.

Greater Manchester's Enterprise Zone will create up to 7,000 jobs at Airport City. The development will expand the world freight terminal and create new business space to attract global businesses.

In Liverpool, the Enterprise Zone will straddle both sides of the River Mersey and accelerate two major regeneration projects on either side - Wirral Waters and Liverpool Waters.

In London, the Mayor will use the Enterprise Zone to regenerate the historic Royal Docks area into a new district to live, work and invest in - creating thousands of new jobs in the process.

And of course the Boots campus in Nottingham aims to generate up to 10,000 jobs across a wide variety of sectors including raising their profile as a 'Science City'.

This is the moment for local areas to decide what their economic future looks like. I hope you don't need me to tell you to simply seize it.

There's a challenge for us in government as well.

We need to ensure that local enterprise partnerships and Enterprise Zones have teeth. That we encourage you to be radical.

Business has been wrapped up in red tape and regulation for too long. It's time to give you room to breathe.

I'm proud of my department's record on deregulating. Over the course of ten months:

  * we've scrapped Home Information Packs;
  * abolished Whitehall rules which pressured councils to hike parking charges, and
  * deleted the two-tier code which has pushed up the cost of providing local services;
  * and we've cut taxes - from delivering a council tax freeze
  * to stopping plans for new bin taxes,
  * reversing the unfair ports tax
  * and introducing a two year business rate holiday for many small firms.

Practical help we've delivered, despite the need to pay off the nation's budget deficit.

That deficit reduction will ensure economic stability and keep long-term interest rates down.

We will continue to set in train a number of reforms that will provide the right incentives and conditions for economic growth.

The New Homes Bonus will reward councils for building new homes and for getting empty homes back into use.

Tax Increment Funding will help finance new local infrastructure.

A reformed Community Infrastructure Levy - providing certainty for developers and support for new development.

Local retention of business rates - not a hike. But to give councils a direct interest in supporting local firms.

As well as far reaching reforms of the planning system - including involving local businesses in new neighbourhood plans to shape the growth of the local community.

There is no doubt in my mind that when I became Secretary of State, the single biggest drag anchor on growth was the planning system - it's expensive, bureaucratic and it doesn't work. But we've recently launched the planning guarantee, ensuring that the journey from application to decision takes less than a year. We're also working to reduce the over 7,000 pages of planning guidance down to 70 - and we'll be consulting on that. I intend that you should be able to work out planning issues without needing to seek advice from leading Counsel. This is good news for communities; good news for growth but likely to be bad news for the legal profession. If your planning silk has to think twice about that third week in Tuscany or whether to buy the Lamborghini after all, that's certainly a price I'm prepared to pay.

So it's about incentivising communities to promote economic growth.

Localism and economic growth go hand in hand.

Through localism we are handing power, responsibility and accountability - and proper accountability - back in the hands of people who know what they are doing.

It's local leaders and local firms together. People who know their area and understand its strengths and its weaknesses. And who have a stake in - and care about - its future.

It's you that can deliver real results. Your enthusiasm and the momentum to rebuild the economy.

So carry on being bold; carry on being ambitious. Tell us how to unlock the barriers to growth. And with business and local areas in the driving seat. I believe that you and I can get the economy moving.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Church House, Westminster",,,,7-Apr-2011,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The Growth Review reaffirmed our commitment to zero carbon. We need to deliver carbon savings in order to meet the Carbon Budgets to which we are committed, and this means that the carbon footprint of new homes cannot be allowed to add to our overall carbon reduction targets. But this needs to be done in ways which are cost effective and which protects the viability of house building. This statement sets out more details of our policy.

A fundamental principle of environmental regulation is that the 'polluter pays'. Previous approaches to zero carbon homes policy have sought to hold house builders responsible for abating the carbon emissions from household appliances. But occupants' use of appliances, such as computers or televisions, is not influenced by the design or structure of their home and is therefore beyond the control of the house builder.

Asking house builders to put in place measures to reduce the emissions from appliances is unfair; we have decided therefore that the regulatory threshold for zero carbon should be set to cover only those emissions which are within the scope of the Building Regulations, such as those from heating, ventilation, hot water, fixed lighting and building services.

There are already a number of existing policies which deal with emissions from appliances, including the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (which caps emissions from electricity generation) and product energy efficiency measures. Moreover, if house builders, working with local planning authorities, still wish to go further in abating emissions from appliances then they are of course free to do so. In order to prevent excessive burdens on industry and protect the viability of development, the Government will work with local authorities and developers to ensure that the cumulative impact of regulation and other costs can be assessed, without adding complex and unwieldy bureaucracy to plans.

As part of meeting the overall requirement, zero carbon homes must be energy efficient homes. We have already made clear our intention to introduce the Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard as based on the work of the Zero Carbon Hub. This will ensure that homes are warmer, and cheaper and easier to heat.

We also said we would look again at the right level for carbon reductions on the site of the home itself - 'carbon compliance'. The Zero Carbon Hub has led a large-scale review of evidence, working with industry, green groups and other experts. The Government has considered with care the findings from this work, and we intend to use the Hub's recommendations on where to set the maximum levels of on site carbon dioxide emissions as a starting point for consultation as part of future revisions to the Building Regulations.

We are also keen to build on industry's commitment to move to an approach based on real world carbon savings, rather than modelled reductions in emissions. This is a bold step forward, and will strengthen focus on innovation delivering new and better technologies and construction methods. We will work with industry to ensure both that this commitment becomes a reality, and that effective assurance is put in place to guarantee the zero carbon standard and that real world carbon savings are achieved. The end result will be better homes and better protection for the environment.

The Hub's report includes a number of detailed recommendations on technical matters which we will consider as part of the further work on the Building Regulations.

Where house builders can deliver more ambitious carbon reductions on the site of the home than these minimum requirements, they will have the option to do so. Where it is not possible for house builders to do this cost effectively, we will ensure that a mechanism is available that allows house builders to meet their commitments at a cost no higher than the Government's long-term value of carbon. This ensures that the offsite requirement of the policy will be delivered cost effectively. This will give industry a benchmark against which to target innovation in carbon reduction technologies which will drive down costs over time.

We intend to work with industry on options for a mechanism to deliver these offsite measures, which will:

  * be made available to all developers operating in England;
  * be cost effective by ensuring offsite measures are no higher than the Governments' long term value of carbon; and
  * ensure that any funds raised will be dedicated to carbon abatement.

We will also review the measures which can be supported under these approaches and will consult further with industry, local government and other partners on these.

Taken together, these proposals deliver a realistic and effective approach to zero carbon, on a par with the most ambitious international efforts to cut domestic carbon and build better, more sustainable homes, whilst at a greatly reduced cost to industry. However, we are keen to look at innovative ways for house builders to meet the additional costs associated with building zero carbon homes. In particular, we are ready to explore with industry the potential of a Green Deal type financing approach for new homes, as a way of offsetting some of the up front costs of zero carbon. We are aware that industry is already forming its thinking on how this can work, and we will continue to work with partners on how best to take this forward.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,,written-statement,17-May-2011,,,improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment,,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

**Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Local Government) (Mr. Bob Neill):**

Between 1997 and 2010, council tax bills doubled. One of the reasons for this was central government imposed unfunded or under-funded burdens on local authorities.

The Coalition Government is committed to ensuring that the net additional costs of all such new burdens from central government policy or initiatives are fully funded to help keep council tax down.

The New Burdens Doctrine sets out the factors that departments should take into account when considering the costs and savings to local authorities arising from changes to policies and programmes. It applies to all departments and covers all local authorities, including police authorities, fire and rescue authorities and local precepting authorities.

As part of the Government's commitment to this principle, and in the spirit of greater transparency in government, today I am publishing a copy of the Whitehall internal guidance on this issue: _The New Burdens Doctrine, Guidance for government departments_. It is being published on my department's website and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,,written-statement,20-Jun-2011,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/buildingregschanges,Changes to building regulations,"* * *

I am setting out today the main elements of the programme of work the Department for Communities and Local Government will lead in the new year to establish the changes required to the building regulations. The work will identify the changes that need to be made to the building regulations regime between now and 2013 to ensure it remains fit for purpose and delivers its contribution to the Government's policy goals.

At the end of July I asked our external partners to tell me their ideas about what in the building regulations needed to be improved or extended, where we might reduce the regulatory burdens and how we might deliver even better levels of compliance. I wanted this to play a key part in helping to deliver our commitment to reduce the burden of regulation while ensuring we had given proper consideration to emerging issues. I am grateful for the way industry and members of the public have responded both in writing and through their participation in workshops.

The programme I am setting out today has been arrived at after active engagement with our external partners. A key theme to emerge from this process has been that these partners believe that although the regime is generally fit for purpose, there are things we can improve. This confirms the Department's belief that the building regulations should remain the national minimum standard that building work should comply with.

While much of the programme of work is deregulatory in nature, it will, however, include work to deliver our commitment to increase energy efficiency through part L (conservation of fuel and power). This will represent our next steps towards zero-carbon buildings and will also provide an opportunity to consider provisions for the existing stock in the light of the Government's emerging policies on reducing carbon emissions, including the green deal. We will also explore how better to ensure high levels of compliance.

In addition, I would like to consider further the case for Government intervention in two other areas. First, whether there is a role to ensure suitable toilet and changing provisions for people with multiple and profound disabilities-often referred to as 'Changing Places'. I would also like to explore further the case in relation to minimum standards for security in homes and explore whether national regulation might be a more effective approach than voluntary and local interventions.

Set against this there are a number of key areas where we want to explore the potential for deregulation and streamlining of the existing provisions. In particular, representations made to Government demonstrate concern with the costs imposed on electricians by part P (electrical safety-dwellings). We believe it is now time to evaluate the building regulations' contribution to the safety outcomes they were intended to support and, if we are to retain regulation of this kind, how we might minimise the associated costs.

We also believe that there is scope to look at the rationalisation of parts M. K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to address areas of potential conflict and overlap between them. As part of this we intend to review existing guidance that promotes the use of access statements in order to consider whether they remain necessary while maintaining the standards of accessibility we are seeking to achieve.

As part of this deregulatory element we also need to explore what changes may be needed to the building control system. I believe there is scope to enhance compliance and reduce the burdens on those who use the system. To that end, over the next few months we will be taking forward work to gather further evidence about actual levels of compliance and reasons for non-compliance. In the light of this, we will be exploring options to further improve enforcement and incentives for responsible businesses. We will also be considering how we can improve the interface with planning and other standards regimes.

In developing this programme we have been mindful, and will remain so, of the need to manage down the regulatory costs to business as part of this process. We will also be specifically considering the impacts on house builders, with the aim of contributing to the achievement of our spending review commitment to reduce regulatory costs over this Parliament.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is also today publishing on its website a supporting document to this statement that provides further information about the exercise we have undertaken and more detail on the programme of work to be taken forward. I am placing copies of this document in the Libraries of both Houses.",andrew-stunell,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/andrewstunnell,,written-statement,16-Dec-2010,,,providing-effective-building-regulations-so-that-new-and-altered-buildings-are-safe-accessible-and-efficient,,,,andrew-stunell,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Many happy returns to CIPFA on its one hundred and twenty fifth annual meeting - celebrating century and a quarter of leadership, education and advocacy on behalf of public finance professionals.

It's appropriate that a grand anniversary should coincide with a momentous time for your members.

Because public finance professionals are facing a moment which calls on all their skills, expertise, and entrepreneurial zeal.

This Government inherited Britain's biggest ever peacetime deficit.

Getting public spending back within sustainable levels is non-negotiable.

You only have to look at the turmoil in Europe to see the alternative.

And let's be clear, whatever the outcome of last year's election, the Government would have been reducing public spending.

No-one is under any illusion about the scale of the challenge that adapting to tight budgets presents.

And don't be in any doubt that looking very closely at the quarter of public spending represented by local government was and is vital.  I want to thank you for your hard work.

But every stage we've sought to protect the most vulnerable.

And - as you know well - despite what certain parts of the media might suggest, the money hasn't somehow vanished into thin air.

Councils have £53bn of spending power this year.

£53bn to control and spend as they see fit, procuring local services.

But when taxpayers are looking hard at their own family budgets, it's even more important to make every penny of that money work as hard as it possibly can.

So what you do.

Getting the basics right. Counting every penny. Getting more for less. Has never mattered more.

And you play the vital role of helping councils look not to short-term fixes, but long-term reform.

Trimming a corner here and there in the hope that things will go back the way is not a route to the sunlit uplands but to a cliff edge.

The right response to tight budgets is to innovate. To provide services in a different way. To transform them.

Now it feels like we've been talking about this for years.

Before Sir Philip Green there was Sir Michael Lyons, before him there was Sir Peter Gershon.

We've aced the theory. Some councils are getting on with the practical.

Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire have begun sharing legal, IT and HR services, cutting costs by more than a million pounds each year.

Six councils, including Cornwall and Dorset, have joined forces with the Environment Agency to reduce the admin costs on their pension funds. They estimate that they could cut overheads by around ten per cent. And on this topic, I'm grateful to CIPFA for the work your pensions panel has been doing with my Department to improve financial management across the Local Government Pension Scheme.

Meanwhile Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster are looking to save thirty-five million pounds and improve services by bringing together the front line.

I'm not saying change is easy. If it were easy, every council would be doing it already.

But these places show it can be done.

And the best councils are never content. They keep asking themselves the hard questions.

Such as: are we doing all we can to crack down on fraud?

Cheshire East Council investigated and found that nearly two thousand people had wrongly claimed council tax benefit. That investigation is helping them recover up to half a million pounds.

Councils are asking themselves - are we procuring in the most intelligent possible way?

Leeds City Council have held ""procurement open days.""

Hillingdon, like many other Boroughs, use the ""London Tenders Portal"" to invite suppliers to bid on-line.

And here in Birmingham, the council has been using e-auctions for some years: helping firms large and small, from national names to local social enterprises, understand what services and goods are needed, and giving the council the option of choosing from a wide range of quotes.

And councils are asking themselves, are we managing our assets as sensibly as we can?

Lancashire County Council have moved to flexible working, and in doing so have been able to rationalise their office space, saving over one million pounds each year and cutting carbon emissions.

All of these examples show that with your expertise. Your understanding. Your leadership. Councils can make the leap to smarter, more effective ways of working.

So as we look ahead, we want to give you more scope to show that leadership. More scope to put your expertise to good use.

In order to make localism a reality, greater legal freedom needs to go hand in hand with greater freedom over finances.

In this first year we've started down the road. Radically cut ring-fencing. Freed up two point one billion pounds from restrictions, comparing this financial year to last.

And simplified over 90 separate funding streams to fewer than 10.

This is just a small start. We are poised to go much further.

Our review of local government resourcing has looked at how we can restore freedom and accountability to a local level. Our starting point is that local funding should be more and more a local issue, determined by local initiative.

In the first stage of the review, we have confirmed that we will repatriate business rates. No more councils forced to come to Treasury with a begging bowl.

Let's be clear, we will make sure that more deprived areas continue to receive support and receive proper reward for the growth they generate.

But I am determined that councils should see a link between the success of local firms and the state of their own coffers.

Giving them even stronger reasons to work in partnership with the private sector. Even stronger reasons to create the conditions for enterprise for flourish.

Following the Localism Bill currently before the Lords, there will be a Local Government Finance Bill to put the local retention of business rates into practice and introduce Tax Increment Financing.

But if our work on business rates is about giving you greater control over the money you collect… our work on community budgets is about giving you greater control over the money that flows from central government.

Councils from Hull to Salford have led the way with the first round of community budgets, looking at problem families.

That is, the one hundred and twenty thousand or so families across the country who account for more than their fair share of calls on the police, the probation service, truancy officers, social workers, and A+E.

Instead of asking a dozen different people in a dozen different agencies, each in their own little room, to think about those families, let's bring those services together.

Giving a better result for those families. A better result for the communities they live in.

Now I think we've seen some great work, and some innovative approaches, with that first wave of community budgets.

But with the next phase, we want to be even more ambitious.

We'll be inviting two neighbourhoods, at a very local level, and two councils, on a bigger geographic scale, to put all public funding for local services into a single pot.

Then letting how services are designed and delivered be dictated not by the shape of Whitehall funding streams, and not by Ministerial command, but by what really counts: what local people want.

And though we are starting on a small scale with these pilots, make no mistake.

This is the shape of things to come.

Local control over cash as the norm; not the exception.

If this is our offer to you, then this is our expectation: with greater local financial freedom must come greater local accountability.

You know my thoughts on the Audit Commission. An organisation that had, over time, become a creature of Whitehall, rather than a champion of local taxpayers. Intent on imposing Whitehall's ideology on councils - with gold stars for those who ticked the most boxes.

But it also lost sight of its own mantra - ""protecting the public purse"".  It is often the small things that speak volumes.

How can we have confidence in a spending watchdog which has held its Board meetings in an Oyster Bar to discuss 'improving corporate governance', and then lost the receipt for the £800 bill?

Or which was spending £1,500 a year on flowers for the reception of its Millbank office - which only stopped in September 2010. Didn't they sense the urgency of the Emergency Budget?

Spending watchdogs and district auditors are no position to lecture councils on financial probity - if they themselves don't care about delivering value for money and protecting taxpayers' cash.

Now, we have published our proposals for the future of local government audit, and we will be looking carefully at your responses to this consultation.

Let's be absolutely clear, we need, and will always need, skilled professionals to oversee the efficient, effective and proper use of taxpayers' money.

I welcome the report by the Select Committee today - which finds that our proposals are ""…consistent with […] wider moves to localism and greater financial independence for local government.""

We'll now be refining our proposals, looking carefully at that report, and your responses to consultation.

But it's also clear that council finances should be much more open and accountable to local taxpayers.

After all, it's their money. In other words: greater local financial control must go hand in hand with greater openness to local scrutiny. Extra scrutiny can help identify and eliminate duplication and waste.

Take the example of Islington. An independent audit of just 30 of the council's top 500 suppliers found that many invoices had even been paid two or even three times over, and four out of ten suppliers had no formal contract. Spending transparency - and the act of collating date for online publication - helps drive out inefficiency, and exposes waste to the light of day.

I'm not making a political point here, by the way. This isn't about political control. Too often, councillors are left in the dark.

I was shocked by a recent case in Barnet. The council had hired a private security firm, MetPro, which included ""keeping an eye"" on local bloggers - at a cost of over a million pounds. The contract had been awarded without a tendering exercise, without a written contract, and no proper invoicing. An internal audit showed there ""serious deficiencies in current procurement arrangements"", and there were no guarantees that against a repeat of such practices.

Irony of ironies - this misuse of public money was uncovered thanks to the determination of local bloggers and activists, including Barnet Eye, Mr Mustard, and Mrs Angry (as she had every right to be.) Exactly the same people MetPro snooped upon.

I've got news for Barnet. Liveblogging from council meetings. Microjournalism. Call it what you like. It's here to stay. In fact this citizen samizdat - local people reporting on their local council's triumphs and shortcomings - is the perfect counterblast to town hall Pravdas.

And it's going further. The next wave of transparency after publishing spending over £500, will be councils publishing contracts and tenders over £500 online as well.

An online list of council contracts will prevent a repeat of the likes of Islington or Barnet, and will spur on greater competition and efficiency.

It doesn't just strengthen the hand of citizens.  It strengthens the hand of ward councillors, letting them know what officials are doing on their behalf.

That's why, looking over the Welsh border, I think Carmathen Council were out of line in having a local blogger arrested for the offence of videoing a public council meeting.

It was immensely short-sighted, too.

Because if councils can show that they can deliver what local people want, and respond to their communities, without relying on instructions, it undermines the centre's need to control. It paves the way for further localism still.

So paradoxically - I think one of Whitehall's important jobs now is help councils behave in ways, which, in the long term, mean we need a bit less of Whitehall.

For example: as you know, councils must by law hold a financial open day, throwing wide their books and inviting local people to examine them - deeds, contracts, vouchers, bills and receipts - the lot.

I intend to collate a central list of the dates of those open days and publish it. So that it's easy for everyone, everywhere, to know when they can examine what their local council has been spending their hard-earned on.

I applaud those councils who have already let my Department know the date of their open day.  Those councils not on the list will be conspicuous by their absence.  So do let us know - we are here to help.

And I applaud the councils who have gone the extra mile. Who aren't waiting. Who are making fuller information available online right away.

I take my hat off to Tendring District Council who have already made publicly available not just their spending over five hundred pounds… but the whole lot.  Every single item. If tiny Tendring can do it - why not everyone else?

Finally, we are transferring power and freedom over finance because we have faith in councils' ability - in your ability - to spend cash wisely.  To be the guardians of the public's money.

With that power comes responsibility. To live up to taxpayers' expectations. Not even the best council can rest on the laurels.

When local government collectively has spending power of some fifty three billion pounds of public money each year, even a couple of per cent of improvements could unlock a billion pounds' worth of efficiencies.

So keep doing what you do.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

Thank you Vij and Lee for you kind introductions. I am delighted to be here.

Let me start by thanking Peter Holland for his contribution over the last year as President and for the support I received from him in my role as Fire Minister.

And let me congratulate you, Lee, on the start of your tenure as President, I know it has been said before that Chief Fire Officers Association Presidents from the Chief Fire Officers Association have up to three different Fire Ministers in a year but I think I must be the first Fire Minister to be on my third President!

I was most interested to hear your views and I hope you will find much to hearten you in my address as you seek to steer the Chief Fire Officers Association towards taking even greater leadership in the future.

### Acknowledging the Fire and Rescue Services

Looking back at over the last 12 months this has been a year when we have seen the Fire Rescue Service exemplifying all that we rightly value in a public service. The response of the women and men of the Fire and Rescue Service to both national and international emergencies has been second to none.

The report earlier this year into the 7 July bombings rightly praised the 'extraordinary courage, composure and compassion' of the Fire and Rescue Service crews and all responders who had to deal with the terrible events unfolding that day.

And much more recently we have again seen the dedication of our firefighters who, in the face of shameful criminal behaviour by rioters, battled to put out fires, whilst at times finding themselves under attack. I am pleased that no one suffered life threatening injury - although some were evidently subjected to quite terrifying ordeals. The remarkable story of Firefighter Peach who was pulled off her bike by the very public she was on her way to work to protect, which she continued on to do was extremely heart warming. The professionalism of fire crews during the riots was outstanding and inspirational and I thank all of them for their efforts.

The co-ordinated approach by emergency services, Local Authorities and Government following the riots was key to getting our high streets back up and running - in many cases the next day.

But as we look to the next 12 months, and Lee, your Presidency tenure I hope you will seize the opportunities for the Fire and Rescue Service.

### Resetting the Relationship, Fire Futures, Localism and the National Framework

We want to free Fire and Rescue Authorities up to concentrate on their local services whilst working collectively together to achieve efficiencies, value for money for the local taxpayer and better services - both at the local level, but at the national level too. We have been putting in place the building blocks needed, first with the Localism Bill and the Fire Futures Review, and as a direct consequence of both, the new National Framework.

The Fire Futures review was the first step in our journey together toward setting out the mechanics of a new relationship and empowering you all, to take greater responsibility and a proactive leadership role. Fire Futures gave you and other sector partners the opportunity to highlight the areas where you thought that Government needed to help by removing inhibiting constraints and regulations.

The Localism Bill, which we plan to enact by the end of the year, responds to this. We will provide you with more freedom and flexibility enabling you to take responsibility and deliver services which truly take account of local considerations. With new powers you will be able to deliver innovative services specific to the communities you serve.

Lee, in your speech you talked of the change in the relationship between Central and Local Government, including Fire and Rescue Authorities. This is vital. It is all about resetting the relationship. You will have heard me make mention of this before but what exactly does it mean?

  * it means taking ownership of your role in the delivery of national resilience; responding effectively to major national emergencies such as natural hazards and malicious threats
  * it means Fire and Rescue Services and Authorities taking ownership of and being accountable for service delivery to individuals and their local communities; local decision making on local services; with the focus moved away from central government
  * it means taking on collective responsibility and managing cross sector functions collaboratively
  * it means improving public safety and preventing deaths and injuries from fire, through promoting fire prevention, particularly amongst the most vulnerable sections of the community.

Much of this you do already, what we need this to step up further, I mentioned before opportunity - this is yours.

  * opportunity for collective leadership at a National level
  * opportunity to further embed your role as a truly local service
  * opportunity for strong local leadership and delivery.

I am particularly encouraged to hear that you are ready to step up and take greater responsibility and show the leadership necessary to take the Service forward and welcome the establishment of the Fire and Rescue Service Advisory Council - it signals an important step and I look forward to seeing it deliver.

I would also like to complement those of you here and the principal officers who act as part of the National Strategic Advisory Team. I see this as an extremely valuable role in coordinating a response to a national event and providing professional advice to strengthen our national resilience arrangements during national emergencies.

But there are many more areas where a strong collaborative fire and rescue approach, perhaps facilitated by Chief Fire Officers Association, would bring further benefits and increase the influence of the Fire and Rescue Service. For example the future control rooms' bids are an opportunity not only for local solutions but for delivery of these broader aims.

Central Government should not be in the business of hands on management of local performance. This is why we have started work with you, and other partners to develop a new National Framework which will reflect and support the new relationship between the centre and Fire and Rescue Authorities. We're clear this can be achieved by the approach I have set out and expect to consult on the draft Framework by the end of the year.

Part of this work on a new Framework will be to clarify roles in relation to resilience and ensure that we prepare for and are able to respond to all the risks we face, from local fires to widespread flooding to terrorist attacks. This is an opportunity for you to take an even stronger role in providing professional leadership and to instil a bottom-up approach to resilience, drawing upon your local expertise and knowledge to ensure that Fire and Rescue Authorities have the necessary capability in place to respond to all risks that may face a local area.

Interoperability is an integral part of resilience. This must also be built on the solid foundation of your experience and expertise, rather than by central Government imposing unwanted top down solutions.

### Better Regulation (Red Tape Challenge)

In the same vein the Government firmly believes that reducing the number of regulations will help remove barriers to economic growth and increase individual freedoms.

I am aware that some of you have supported calls for more regulation for fire safety in the home and in non-domestic buildings, particularly in relation to smoke alarms and sprinklers. This is an important issue, however we want to avoid excessive regulation where non-regulatory routes can offer the same outcomes, as we have seen with smoke alarm ownership.

In this context, I am delighted that Councillor Mark Healey, Chair of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Authority, has kindly agreed to support the Fire Kills campaign by helping promote smoke alarm ownership messages to private rented landlords. This is a great example of a sector-led initiative, highlighting what can be done through non-regulatory routes.

I would also like to let you know that we will be publishing the Fire Kills Annual Report for 2010/11 shortly which will provide detail on the national advertising strategy and outlines the key PR and partnership activity undertaken to target the harder to reach and those potentially more vulnerable to the risks of fire.

### Fire Service College

Lee, in your address you made reference to future arrangements for the Fire Service College. I was there just this morning speaking at the Fire Service Chaplains' Conference. Last week we launched the first phase of work to explore options for a new ownership, operational and governance model for the Fire Service College which is another important opportunity for the Sector.

Let me be clear. We see strong value in a national College, delivering common, consistent standards of safety critical training and improved intra-operability across the Service in support of resilience, and enabling it to meet public expectations.

But the current College ownership and business arrangements do not provide the flexibility necessary for it to operate with sufficient commercial success.

This is your opportunity to step forward and help secure the future of the College, whether independently or in partnership with other organisations. I know you will rise to this challenge and look forward to hearing your views.

### Funding and Economic Environment

However, with all of these issues we are discussing today I am mindful of the financial context which we must all note and all working within. I have been extremely heartened to hear how many of you have risen to the challenges that the spending review has posed.

[Political content removed].

You know that my view is that whilst, the settlement has been tough, it was a fair one in a difficult environment, and one that demonstrates our commitment to protecting front-line services. You have risen to the demands of protecting front-line services in the new environment some of you are considering merging, many of you have streamlined operations or have rationalised backroom services.

We protected Fire and Rescue in the first two years to give you time to prepare but to continue to tackle the deficit further savings are still required. Having said that, everything I've seen from you tells me that you will also rise to meet this challenge.

At this point I would like to highlight the consultation on capital grant funding for the next three years as a means of investing to deliver efficiencies to help you live within your reduced resource budgets. I wish to be clear that capital grant funding must be targeted to areas that deliver the greatest efficiencies and we are currently consulting upon a competitive bidding process, complimented by the current pro-rata distribution - providing a degree of certainty over future allocations. We are keen to receive responses on the proposed process by 21 October 2011.

Understandably, you all want to know what years three and four will look like for you, and as things stand it won't be until autumn 2012 before we can tell you.

There are a number of variables, not least the local government resource review and you will have seen our direction of travel, with policies to devolve power; improve accountability and unchain local innovation being equally important in funding as in other areas. We are keen to introduce changes to provide a direct financial incentive for local government to promote local economic growth, as well as reducing the dependency of many authorities on central government grant.

In particular, our proposals on business rates retention cover all local authorities, including Fire and Rescue Authorities and we are actively seeking your views on these proposals.

There are some key issues that I am sure you will want to consider, including, for example, should single purpose Fire and Rescue Authorities be treated like county councils; be part of the business rates retention scheme, and be able to benefit from growth in business rates? Or is there a case for treating single purpose authorities like police authorities and have their funding direct from central government?

So, in short, the 2013 to 2015 sums for individual Fire and Rescue Authorities depend on a number of decisions still to be made, in particular whether you are part of the business rates retention scheme and, as part of that, how the baseline is set.

I know that your finance officers have been taking a very keen interest in this topic. I am pleased about the level of debate that the future of your funding has engendered and look forward to seeing your response to the consultation.

### Pensions Consultation

And then closer to home for many of your staff will be the understandable concerns about the pension issues. The previous administration introduced the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme, but did not tackle issues surrounding the old scheme, which remains the most expensive in the public sector in terms of total contributions. Increasing longevity has meant that the cost of providing the scheme has continued to rise, putting further pressure on Fire Authority budgets. The Government's reform proposals stemming from the Hutton Review around a career average scheme and improved longevity risk management, which are at the heart of our reform agenda, will put the fire pension schemes onto a more sustainable footing.

We have listened and will continue to listen to the concerns raised around opt-outs. Maximising membership is important for the long-term viability of these schemes. The consultation which I published last week takes steps to minimise opt-outs. Any increases in contributions will be phased in over three years. The increases will be progressive. And the proposals will provide protection to the more affordable New Firefighters' Pension Scheme.

There is also a strong economic rationale for people to remain in public service pension schemes and it is important that firefighters hear that message and maintain their support for the schemes.

This is why the Department for Communities and Local Government, and other Government Departments, are asking professional bodies like the Chief Fire Officers Association, individual chief fire officers and senior managers, to show leadership on this issue as the reform process gathers pace.

I know that there remains some uncertainty around the process, which is understandable. It is important that workforces understand the reform context and what it means for them. The Firefighters' Pension Committee has a key role to play here. In addition, alongside the consultation document, my Department has published a pension reform question and answer paper which can be used as a basis to talk to your workforce.

### Industrial Relations - Business Continuity

With pensions to the fore, before I conclude there is a final key area on which we should focus. I refer to business continuity arrangements.

As I have clearly indicated I believe that it is possible to achieve change, even on thorny issues such as pensions, through consultation, dialogue and negotiation with trades unions. However, we all have a duty to be ready should those negotiations break down.

If there were to be a national dispute over pensions, and I repeat I see no reason why there should be one, then it will be for you to ensure that arrangements are in place to protect communities and business in your areas.

### Summing Up

In closing I would like to share with you the optimism I feel for the future. From what I have heard here today this is a future with Fire and Rescue Authorities working together to share expertise, talent and resources; working with the communities they serve;, accepting accountability, and demonstrating strong local and national leadership.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I'm delighted to have this opportunity to speak alongside Lord Adonis and Lord Heseltine, who have done so much to galvanise the debate on the future of our cities.

It's also an honour to share a stage with Mike Ward and Sir Peter, each of whom brings so much passion and intelligence to working for the future of their respective cities.

All I want to do today is answer a simple question. It is to explain why, in the Coalition Agreement, the Government made a commitment to establishing elected mayors in cities outside London, subject to a confirmatory referendum of local people.

Let me start with an example that will be familiar to everyone here. Nearly one hundred and forty years ago, Joseph Chamberlain became mayor of Birmingham. At the age of 37, he was not what would now be called a career politician. He had spent his early life running family businesses - trading in ironware and shoes. But his business acumen equipped him well for civic life. After just three years as mayor, he was able to boast that he had left his city ""parked, paved, assized, marketed, gas and watered and improved.""

His influence is still evident today, from parks that soften the city, to fine buildings on Corporation Street, to the University. But his legacy is more than physical: he has become a symbol of what good local government can achieve, and an abiding inspiration to generations of people who believe in public service in their city.

It is no coincidence, I would argue, that Chamberlain represented a particular brand of leadership. He was a charismatic individual who assumed the captaincy of his city, exercised broad powers, and set a clear personal vision.

Today, the great challenge before us is one of economic growth. And I am convinced that the battle for Britain's prosperity will be won or lost in our cities. It is a challenge on a global scale. Consider Birmingham, the second largest city economy in the United Kingdom, but only now the 71st largest in the world. A world, in which economic power is shifting from West to East and North to South. Where, when it comes to competing for the brightest graduates and the best investment, you don't just have to beat Barcelona, but Bangalore too.

Our cities have great strengths and a proud history, but they need to fight harder than ever to be heard in world that is dawning. Vigorous local leadership is becoming more important as every year goes by.

It is self evident that each of our cities is distinct and unique. Bristol and Newcastle, Manchester and Leicester, they all have different ambitions, different assets. No team of ministers or officials in London - no matter how bright or well-intentioned - can devise one set of solutions that fit these very different circumstances. To achieve their ambitions, to fulfil their potential, cities need to take charge of their own destinies. The drive must come from within, not without.

> ""To achieve their ambitions, to fulfil their potential, cities need to take charge of their own destinies.""

Where we can see strong leadership, complemented by clear accountability to local people, we in central Government are ready to help cities do things their way. Our great cities should not be run as branch offices of central Government. This may turn the established order on its head, but it's time that Whitehall knew its place. Let Birmingham be Birmingham, let Manchester be Manchester. Let cities have the powers and freedoms they need tailored to their individual circumstances. I am, for example, looking forward to talking with Sir Peter about the new freedoms he needs to help him shape Leicester's future.

Local leadership can come in many forms. Look at Mike's past eight years as leader here - producing ambitious plans for the city centre, securing improvements to New Street Station, and getting the new library underway. Or take Mike's key role in making a success of the new Local Enterprise Partnership, for example by securing the involvement of Andy Street - the MD of John Lewis - one of Britain's most outstanding business leaders in one of Britain's most admired companies. Mike's achievements stand as testament that great things are possible under current arrangements.

But I believe the evidence also shows that some forms of leadership are better suited than others in helping cities reach their full potential. The experience, both in this country and abroad, suggests that the leadership model with the greatest promise of all is the elected mayor.

Research undertaken on behalf of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2005 found that the democratic mandate provided by directly elected mayors has - and I quote ""provided a basis for a stronger, more proactive style of leadership than other models.""

The world's great cities have mayors who lead for their city on the national and international stage, attracting investment and jobs.

Look at the cities that Birmingham is twinned with: Chicago, Frankfurt, Johannesburg, Lyon and Milan. All led by an executive mayor.

We believe that mayors can help English cities achieve their full potential too.

In its twelve years of existence, the Mayoralty of London is already hailed across the world for its influence in raising the profile of the capital and for securing major projects the city needs - from Crossrail to the Olympic games.

Mayors have clout - a personal mandate to speak truth to central Government, to argue for the interests of those they represent.

Mayors are visible - with a profile that makes them natural ambassadors for their cities, especially when it comes to attracting investment.

And with a four-year term, mayors have the space to think for the long term, to make tough strategic decisions, to get public and private sectors working together effectively.

In short, I believe that mayors have the greatest potential of any leadership model, which is why we are asking our largest cities to vote on whether they want to move to a mayoral system.

To those who worry that our proposals represent an imposition on communities - I would say that, on the contrary, referendums give people a chance to look at the evidence and decide for themselves. All we are doing is insisting on the debate - and giving the people of each city the chance to have their say.

Last Thursday, Parliament considered the order that would allow the people of Birmingham can have their say on the 3rd May. Subject to further parliamentary debates, we soon hope to confirm that ten more cities will be having a referendum in May too. If cities vote yes to having a mayor, a further ballot will take place to decide who that first mayor should be.

The new mayor should be in place sooner rather than later to get on with the job. So I can announce today that our intention is that this ballot will take place on November 15: the same day as the elections for the first police commissioners - and hence a day that I hope will be a landmark in the shift of powers and influence from Whitehall to communities.

2012 will be a mayoral year in Britain. We will see a contest that will decide who will be leader of our capital city in this, its Olympic summer. We will see mayoral referendums in 11 of our great cities. Where cities want it, we will see further votes in November. There is every prospect that by the end of this year a new generation of mayors will be in post.

Now it's over to you. This May, the people of our cities will have the chance to have their say. Now is the time to start weighing up what a mayor can do for your city, and so I welcome today's debate as just such an opportunity.

Thank you to the Chamber of Commerce for hosting this occasion. Birmingham has made a rich contribution to the history of municipal leadership. I can't think of a better place to witness a debate that is key to its future.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,Birmingham Chambers of Commerce,,,,25-Jan-2012,,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

I'm here to talk about an incredibly simple idea. That's about spending public money better.

Because when times are hard, or indeed when times are plentiful, wasting resources and duplicating effort makes absolutely no sense.

But - take the case of 'problem families' and that's exactly what happens.

You have local agencies from the police, the social worker, to the job centre working with the same people but totally apart. Funded by multiple Whitehall programmes. Separated by bureaucratic barriers that decide how they work together.

No doubt the family gets a poor deal when they are pushed from pillar to post - caught between a myriad of programmes and professionals.

It's about time Whitehall started trusting local communities. And local agencies started trusting each other. Because the future has got to be working together.

And what better way to make the services work together than by putting all the money in one place? A single pot of local funding that can be targeted straight at the frontline.

A Community Budget.

Everyone in the public sector is playing their part to tackle the legacy of debt we've inherited. Many councils are clamping down on senior pay, improving procurement, cutting out waste.

But important as this is - we need to do more than economise and tinker around the edges.

It's time for a radical shake up of the way that services are delivered at the front line.

The best public bodies don't assume they have to do things the way they always have. Deliver the same old services.

They ask fundamental questions about how services are run. Who is running them. And whether they really offer the best possible value to the taxpayer.

We're giving all councils the political freedom they need to ask big questions in this way. To think and act creatively.

We've cut red tape. Put an end to thousands of Whitehall targets, to interference and inspection. The general power of competence gives councils the legal confidence to act in their communities' best interests.

But this isn't enough. Communities need economic freedom - to be trusted with their own money.

Until now money from the centre has always come with strict caveats. By the time the rules had been followed. The forms had been filled. The conditions had been satisfied. There was always going to be an awful lot less.

The puppet masters at Whitehall are going to step back and let local councils and agencies get re-animated about local problems.

They'll have a reason to be efficient. An incentive to be imaginative. The power and confidence to do what local voters want them to do.

We're changing the way councils and services are financed, ending ringfencing.

And with Community Budgets, we want to get as close as possible to the idea that councils and local areas should get a single pot of local funding from Government, to spend as they see fit.

We've started with problem families. They may be less than 1 per cent of the population - but we know a problem family can cost central and local agencies up to £330,000 a year.

We estimate across the country 46,000 families with the greatest difficulties cost the economy £2.2billion in reactive spending alone.

Children going into care. Families evicted for anti-social behaviour. Truancy. Vandalism. Nuisance behaviour.

Any local politician worth his salt will probably know the family members by name.

As will the police. The courts. The schools. The job centre. And social workers.

It's time to fit the solution around the problem - rather than vice versa - by bringing these people together. Getting straight to the heart of the problems facing some of England's most chaotic families.

On the 1st of April there will be 16 pioneering Community Budgets up and running across the country. They have taken less than six months to set themselves up and have plans to deal with at least 10,000 problem families in the next four years.

I met with Community Budget leaders last week and I'm quite excited about the work that's going on. They will treat families like families - not tackling their problems in isolation.

And they focus on outcomes, not processes.

In Islington the Council, the NHS, Job Centre Plus, Probation, Police, housing and voluntary sector - will pool staff and over £6m of resources. To give exactly the kind of intensive support that some families who are facing particular problems in their area need.

Half of the children in this borough live in poverty and the vast majority live in a household where no one works. The Islington Community Budget aims to turn these sad statistics around.

There will be a new Family Outreach Support Service in place this autumn able to support a thousand families with persistent problems at any one time.

And they will also look to prevent families falling into crisis by working with 9000 unemployed parents. Supporting them to get back into work.

These families won't be faced with dealing with lots of different professionals based in lots of different locations to get the help they need. The professionals themselves will join up the dots in order that the family get early, coordinated support.

There's clear evidence we need to start taking this approach.

Swindon estimated that a social worker spends 86 per cent of their time at their desk.

And of the 14 per cent of the time they spend with families - half of that is filling in forms so that they can go back to their desk and complete some more paperwork.

It's not their fault.  No social worker signs up out of a deep love of filing.

But it's clear councils and local agencies need genuine control and freedom. To ensure the frontline is actually working on the frontline not stuck in the back room.

A pilot in Swindon brought together professionals from housing, the police, the NHS and children's and adult's services to work intensively with 12 families for two years.

Some of this was just helping them sort out rent arrears and getting the washing machine to work. And there were trickier issues like managing a teenager's violent behaviour.

The result was children coming off child protection plans. Children going to school more regularly. Evictions avoided. Police callouts reduced. Adults getting back into work.

After spending £190,000 Swindon believe they could save over £1.5m in two years.

By intervening early, and working together, to really turn people's lives around - Community Budgets is about doing what works.

So professionals can genuinely make a difference for families, rather than getting lost in a quagmire of bureaucracy.

Credit where it's due, Total Place - the last Government's attempt to bring services together - was a step in the right direction.

Its heart was in the right place.

But though it was very good at pinpointing the problems: it was much less good at actually changing the way things work.

The political will for change just wasn't there. In the end it was far more talk than action.

As I've said before, it was a bit like your Dad letting you go down the disco.

And then hanging around outside all night cramping your style.

Community Budgets are Total Freedom.

And that's why they've got the backing of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasury, and all the Cabinet.

The Government is breaking down the barriers and delivering the flexibilities that will enable areas to achieve their ambitions.

Hammersmith & Fulham are currently developing a project with Ministry of Justice and Department for Education to tackle the delays to applications for taking children into care.

Department for Education have also committed to funding over 20 innovative exemplar projects so the Community Budget areas can to test out new ways of supporting these families and support other areas to follow their lead.

They've also offered advances on future years funding to invest in the redesign of services for families.

But we don't underestimate any of the challenges we're facing.

We're talking about nothing less than totally changing the way frontline professionals work.

And a shakeup of Government too, for good measure.

A pretty tall order. But my message to local areas is don't be afraid to think big. To be as bold and as innovative as you can.

The sky really is the limit. This is the future for public services. And if we can get 16 areas up and running in less than six months think what we can achieve moving forward.

I want all areas to be able to tackle problem families and other key local priorities through community budgets from 2013.

I'd say there are five tests for how we will know community budgets have worked and they're very simple:

  * more local control. Councils coming together with their partners to create local solutions to local problems
  * much better use of resources - giving residents a better deal as money goes straight to the frontline
  * more robust local accountability - acting on behalf of communities not Westminster
  * locally agreed outcomes that reflect what residents want
  * finally - and this is their own test - to be able to show obvious progress in delivering a radical solution and sense of direction.

If we get this right, there is incredible potential to really make a difference to hundreds of thousands of families.

And I'm committed to working with local government to develop much bigger community budgets covering much more local public spending.

A number of Leaders from the first phase areas are going to be doing intensive work with us on this.

Community budgets where the council, the police, GPs, Job Centre Plus and all the rest come together to tackle problems that matter to them locally without interference from Westminster.

For too long we've handed out pocket money to local agencies and told them how to spend like an overbearing parent. It's time to let local areas grow up. To do things their way.

It needs to be done. We need to be ambitious and bold. And if this causes discomfort to some Whitehall bureaucrats - good. This is about transforming the future of public spending.

Councils are going to become almost unrecognisable in a very short period. Local communities are going to be in the driving seat.

16 Community Budget areas are already heading down the road to independence. Now the challenge is for the rest of the country to follow them.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Copthorne Tara Hotel, London",,,,29-Mar-2011,giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

Last year I talked about my enthusiasm for Community Land Trusts but I wasn't able to do much more about it.

But now I am Minister for Housing and Local Government I have the opportunity to transfer power to where it really belongs - local communities.

So this year I am going to be able to do what I said I wanted to do last year.

Well actually it's more the case that you and thousands like you will be able to do what you want with CLTs.

I visited the building site which was the CLT in Rock in Cornwall several years ago.

That visit helped me see the enormous potential for CLTs.

Inspired by what I'd seen I worked to persuade the last government to recognise CLTs in law through a clause in the Housing and Regeneration Bill 2008, in order to help secure financing elsewhere.

I got to see the Rock CLT completed when I visited again last winter.

But now there is more to do.

In opposition I said that if we won the election we would start a revolution - where communities would get involved in providing homes for themselves.

Today it's time to start that revolution.

But don't worry, I'm not asking you to join me at the barricades - this will be a very English revolution.

But it will still be dramatic.

And long lasting.

We will turn things upside down.

And for the first time it will be communities, not central Government, who decide what happens in their local area.

This particular revolution? Well, it started with little more than a Task Force. I commissioned Dr Karl Dayson, from the University of Salford, to lead it.

I was amazed to read in his report that civil servants were apparently worried that CLTs would become a 'charter for cults and extreme political groups'.

Now I don't know if the penpushers were simply worried that the author Karl Dayson shared his first name with the 19th century author of the Communist Manifesto!

But looking around this auditorium you lot don't look like members of a cult or extreme political organisation. You just look like people who want to get local housebuilding going again.

I would like to thank the taskforce which has provided me with some great ideas about the lessons that we can learn.

I've also heard from many of you about your struggle with bureaucracy and financing.

Some of you may be hoping that more money will now be available. I need to be honest with you.

Community based housing bodies like CLTs are going to have to work within the same financial constraints as everyone else.

But I think in your hearts you know that Government funding is not the answer.

In fact the bureaucracy that comes with Government cash can sometimes stifle plans.

I know you're involved in workshops here looking at financing options.

And I will work hard to help you find the answers.

For instance, somewhat surprisingly, even the local tier of government sometimes struggles to transfer control to local communities.

That is why I now want to widen opportunities for communities to shape what happens next.

I want to use your experience to create a model for Local Housing Trusts.

The core of the proposal is something you will be familiar with. We want local people to decide what happens in their community.

The main difference is that I believe that a community should be able to proceed with developing new homes - where there is strong local support - without specific planning applications.

LHTs will have to show that they have the overwhelming backing from people living in the area and they will need to meet some basic planning criteria to make their proposals sound.

But essentially I want communities to have the freedom to decide on the type and quantity of housing without external restrictions imposed by a centralised planning system.

And I've no doubt that many schemes will seek to provide more affordable homes in these villages. People want to help young people to stay in their community.

Villages may also want to build some housing to sell, sheltered housing for the elderly, or even set aside plots for people to build their own homes.

It will be up to the Local Housing Trust.

They will be able to make a judgement about how best to invest in their community and meet its needs.

For instance, they might offer long-term low rent for local shops, a community hall, or a sports facility.

Once the new development has been built, Trusts will be expected to invest any financial profits back into the community.

And the land will remain in the Trust for local benefit forever - regardless of what happens to the homes built on top.

People have waited long enough for a model that is on their side rather than on the side of the bureaucrat.

I want to unlock the passion and drive of these communities.

I want to free them to realise their vision.

I can announce today that I intend to take the necessary legislation through the forthcoming Localism Bill.

I want the first LHTs to be under way as soon as possible.

I will work with you to make sure the journey you've begun brings the success you deserve.

These are exciting times for you.

Revolutionary times.

So let's finally bring Community Land Trusts home for good.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

As you'll know, this week's Budget will set out the Government's plans to go for growth.

And my Department has a huge role to play.

I'm very proud of our reputation as one of the most deregulating Departments in Whitehall.

Much of this has been cutting the red tape that local councils face from the central state from Comprehensive Area Assessment to Place Surveys, to National Indicator Sets.

We've also cut red tape on the voluntary sector - such as making it easier for local communities to hold street parties during the Royal Wedding.

And we're cutting regulation and removing obstacles that local firms face.

I think the Department - like many others - hasn't paid enough attention to business in the past.

But things are very different now.

One of the first things I did on arrival was to scrap Home Information Packs, an action which has cut the cost of selling a home.

I've scrapped the ports tax, stopping the unfair and retrospective imposition of backdated business rates on firms in ports, which threatened to sink our export trade.

I've removed Whitehall planning rules which compelled councils to hike up parking charges in town centres.

And I've also abolished plans for penalty taxes to be imposed on parking spaces at local supermarkets.

On rates, I've doubled small business relief for a year, and the law is being changed to make it easier for small firms to claim it automatically without continuously filling in forms.

And soon, I hope, it'll be goodbye to more red tape.

I can reveal today I am actively considering scrapping the so-called Local Authority Two-Tier Code introduced by the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

Where councils outsource functions, it required private firms to employ new workers on the same terms as the public sector workers who transferred across.

It has increased the cost to the taxpayer of providing public services, and is actively discouraging the creation of new jobs by private firms.

I can also announce that we will be relaxing regulations that have stopped developers converting disused commercial property into homes.

It's in everyone's interests to make it easier to turn run-down old eyesores into much-needed new homes. Let the market decide what's best so far as housing is concerned.

I want Whitehall to get out of the way, and I want to work with councils and local firms to create local jobs and local growth.

I know some people are sceptical about localism.

Some even argue that growth is incompatible with localism.

But my answer is - was centralisation such a great success?

After years of regional house building targets house building fell to its lowest peacetime levels since 1924.

Too often, Whitehall targets had a perverse, unintended consequence.

National planning rules on density helped create an unsustainable glut of flats, worsening the shortage of family homes.

Targets on councils to assess planning applications by a set deadline encouraged them to refuse complex applications just to meet that deadline.

And laws like the 2004 Planning Act, and its requirement to provide volumes of Local Development Documents, made the planning system slower rather than faster.

All centralisation has done is create a completely unbalanced economy. Over reliant on particular industries. Over reliant on the public sector. Over reliant on a tiny fraction of our potential.

Through localism, we are putting power, responsibility and accountability back in the hands of people who know what they are doing.

Who understand their area.

Who know its strengths.

Who care about its future.

Because we believe in incentives rather than instructions.

In co-operation, rather than conflict.

So we're giving communities a reason to say 'yes' to development and to new homes - because they'll see the financial benefits.

It seems incredible to me that for years, we've had a system where at best, councils did not have a direct financial interest in what local businesses were up to and whether their fortunes went up or down.

And at worst, it's like they deliberately set out to frustrate businesses with petty rules and regulations.

We are saying; clearly and unambiguously, local government should be positively supporting local businesses.

And we're using the financial carrot, rather than the legal stick.

I think it's a wonderful thing - by shaking up the business rates system, they've got a financial stake in the growth and creation of local firms.

Though of course - unless any of you tell me this is what you want - that doesn't mean the green light to rack up the rates.

Instead, were saying to councils: you've got to take responsibility for promoting growth and enterprise.

Some seem to think that being pro-business has to mean being anti-green.

When in fact, it's business that is at the cutting edge of low carbon technology.

Or that being anti-business means being anti-community.

Well growing a strong business environment isn't a threat to a healthy community - it's the foundation.

Councils have wanted greater freedom, greater flexibility, the chance to be in the driving seat.

But they have simply got to be prepared for the responsibility that comes with that.

It means if you want to get things done: don't wait for Government to pass a law or sort it out for you. Get on with it.

Take that chance to work with the community in your shared interests - or risk the economic consequences of cowardice and indecision.

One of the biggest sources of friction between councils and business is the planning system.

The problem is - frankly - structural.

Today, there are something like 900,000 words in planning guidance.

That makes War and Peace look like light reading.

In fact, that's more than the complete works of Shakespeare.

And, if we carried on at the same rate over the next Parliament, we'd have not just the complete works of Shakespeare but the Bible as well - both Old and New Testaments.

Just think, if Kirsty Young ever invites me on to Desert Island Discs, I'd be able to say give me the ""complete planner"". I am confident that with each page turn I would increase my desire to be rescued.

The planning system should act as a driver for growth.

But if I am being completely frank with you, it's the drag anchor to growth.

How many proposals disappear into the planning system, never to be seen again?

Millions of pounds are wasted.

Many months and years are lost to delays.

We need a system which supports growth: not shuts it down.

We need a system that always says yes to the right sorts of development.

Which gets to grips with the national housing shortage.

Which helps business grow and expand.

And which delivers the infrastructure, transport, and energy we need to thrive in this new century of ours.

We also need a system that is much more democratic.

When targets and plans are dreamed up in remote offices far from the places they are supposed to help, it's no surprise that communities stamp their feet and say no.

In fact, there really is only one option. The only way they get listened to.

We've got a system that is largely predicated upon conflict, which sets up business, councils and communities as adversaries.

When I came into office is appeared to me that we have a planning process that function by appeal.

What we need is a system which encourages them to work together.

And let's be clear, democracy must not, does not, come at the cost of delays.

Neighbourhood plans will involve every part of the community, businesses as well as residents, right from the very outset.

More agreement upfront means fewer wrangles later on.

We need a system which is much, much simpler.

At the moment, it's a labyrinth. Few dare to enter. Even fewer survived unscathed.

Using the planning system shouldn't feel like you're going ten rounds with bureaucracy.

And we shouldn't need an army of experts to navigate it.

I am absolutely determined to cut the planning system down to size.

Less the length of a Shakespearian tragedy, more the brevity of the Gettysburg address.

I want a system where both local residents and local councils see the benefits of development, and work together with local firms to shape the future of their community.

Despite billions of pounds thrown at Regional Development Agencies; we've still got huge inequality between different parts of the country.

I don't believe regionalism worked.

We needed a new way of local firms and local councils working hand in hand to promote economic development.

Local Enterprise Partnerships have a radically different approach to economic development.

Putting local councils and local businesses in the driving seat.

It's all about growth, not about grants.

And those local partnerships will be at the heart of new the Local Enterprise Zones.

Helping define exactly where we should cut taxes still further. And sweeping away the restrictions on growth. So that new businesses and new jobs can flourish.

With this kind of opportunity on offer, it is no wonder there has been a very positive response. Local enterprise partnerships now cover 90 per cent of the country.

To everyone involved it is obvious, they are moving at different rates.

But I don't see anything wrong with that.

In fact, I think a bit of healthy competition, a bit of rivalry, is probably quite a good thing.

Now I know that some of you started off as sceptics about these new partnerships.

But what I really do appreciate is the way that the Confederation of British Industry and its members have worked with us.

And I know that discussions have happened with many of my officials - including my Permanent Secretary.

In truth I don't mind a bit of disagreement. I am from Yorkshire a place that has made bluntness an art form. The Confederation of British Industry has been robust in your views on planning and growth.

I think we have ended up with something much better than what we started with.

That is thanks to you and your members who've been prepared to work with us.

I'm very grateful for that.

And I hope it's just one of the areas where we'll continue to work closely together in future.

I certainly believe that it's important to get the question of local growth correct and through that to delvier a better Britain.

I am today announcing the publication of a consultation on draft Directions to be issued by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to the Social Housing Regulator. Alongside the statutory provisions contained in the Localism Bill, the proposed changes to regulation outlined in this consultation will help deliver the Government's package of reforms to make the system of social housing fairer and to reverse the consensus that had developed that allowed waiting lists to grow to record levels. This forms part of an overall shake of up of social housing that will also see the delivery of up to 150,000 new affordable homes over the next four years. These reforms will give social landlords and local authorities the flexibility to make the best use of social housing in a way which best meets the needs of their local area.

Today signals a landmark in the freeing up of councils to successfully manage their own housing stock for the benefit of their tenants. A change that has long been talked about, but the Coalition Government is actually delivering.

Today we are publishing the information councils need to plan for this significant reform. Reforms which will see councils keep their own rents and spend them on their own housing. This includes a detailed description as to how their opening financial position will be determined and the process for implementing these reforms in April 2012. It also gives each local authority a much clearer idea as to exactly how they will be affected by the reforms. This will enable them to use the next 14 months to plan ahead and put themselves in the best possible position to maximise the benefits of the new freedoms. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.

In line with the Government's emphasis on transparency, local authorities and tenants will be able to see how and why the valuation has altered since the proposals published in March 2010.

Our proposals for self-financing for council housing will:

  * give councils the resources they need to manage their own housing stock for the long-term - correcting decades of under-funding
  * give councils the incentives and flexibility they have sought to drive up quality and efficiency
  * give tenants the information they need to hold their landlord to account - replacing the current opaque, centralised system with one which establishes a clear relationship between the rent councils charge and the services they provide

These reforms are fair. They are rooted in a consistent and tested calculation of the value of each council's social housing business, producing a sustainable self-financing settlement for each local authority. I expect all councils to welcome the reforms and to start planning now how to make the most of their new freedom.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,,written-statement,1-Feb-2011,,,improving-the-rented-housing-sector,,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr Eric Pickles): I am pleased to inform the House that the Spending Review has allocated a £650m fund to help local authorities to implement a council tax freeze in England in 2011-12. Council tax has more than doubled since 1997 and the freeze will offer real help to hard working families and those on fixed incomes such as pensioners. It will help save local taxpayers in England up to £70 living in an average Band D home in England.

Alongside this, the Government continues to provide more flexibility for councils to protect frontline services like rubbish collections and care for the elderly. It intends to stop the council tax revaluation which would have led to greater tax bills over the lifetime of this Parliament for many families. The Government also intends to give local residents a new power to veto excessive council tax rises in the future, both to protect the interests of local communities and strengthen local democracy.

My department has written to local authorities today with full details of how the scheme will operate. For the benefit of the House, the key elements are as follows:

> a) The scheme will be voluntary; and will apply separately to each billing and major precepting authority in England (including police and fire and rescue authorities) rather than to each council tax bill issued. Local precepting authorities, such as town and parish councils, will not be included in the scheme.
> 
> b) Where an authority does not increase its basic amount of council tax in 2011-12 compared with 2010-11, it will be eligible to receive a grant equivalent to a 2.5 per cent increase in its 2010-11 Band D figure multiplied by the latest available tax base figure. Slightly different arrangements - still based upon a 2.5 per cent grant - will apply for the Greater London Authority and for those authorities which restructured in 2009, to reflect their unique circumstances.
> 
> c) The police authorities of Greater Manchester and Nottinghamshire that are subject to capping in advance for 2011-12, will be able to take part in the scheme.
> 
> d) The Spending Review has concluded that funding can only be provided to support a council tax freeze for 2011-12. However, the Government intends to provide supplementary funding to local authorities' in subsequent years of the Spending Review to compensate them for the council tax income foregone during the period of the freeze.

The Government is delivering on its promise to deliver a freeze, which is good news for council tax payers in England. The Government expects all local, fire and police authorities to sign up to the freeze and can see no reason why they might choose to do otherwise. Nevertheless, we will not allow these authorities to set an excessive council tax increase and are prepared to use capping powers where necessary. I also urge town and parish councils to exercise restraint and make sure no council tax payer faces an increased bill.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,21-Oct-2010,,,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/counciltaxcapping201112,Council Tax capping 2011 to 2012,"* * *

On 13 December, I indicated that when the House debated the final local government finance report I would set out council tax capping principles that will apply to local authorities' budgets for 2011-12. I am therefore now informing the House that I will consider an authority to have set an excessive increase if:

> (a) the amount calculated by the authority as its budget requirement for 2011-12 is more than 92.5 per cent of -
>
>> (i) the authority's alternative notional amount; or
>> 
>> (ii) where no such amount has been specified for the authority, the authority's budget requirement for 2010-111; and
> 
> (b) the amount calculated by the authority as its band D council tax for 2011-12 is more than 3.5 per cent greater than the same amount calculated for 2010-11 (except see below).

Different principles will apply to the Greater London Authority (GLA), and to the councils of Central Bedfordshire and Shropshire. The reasons for this are -

  * in the case of the GLA, because the authority calculates its council tax in a different way from other authorities2, and
  * in the case of Central Bedfordshire and Shropshire, because the authorities set their basic amounts of council tax for 2010-11 under part 4 of the Local Government (Structural Changes) (Finance) Regulations 20083 and may do so again for 2011-12.

My officials will write to these three authorities separately with further technical details about how the principles applicable to them will operate. However, I can confirm that the policy aim of the capping principles for 2011-12 is the same for all authorities and that the principles for the GLA, Central Bedfordshire and Shropshire are designed to ensure that appropriate comparisons can be made between the band D council tax set by those authorities in 2010-11 and 2011-12.

I am this year announcing these principles before the dates by which authorities have to set their budgets. This contrasts with the approach of the previous Government, which always required authorities to wait and see whether the council tax they had set would be considered excessive by reference to principles not decided until after the deadlines for setting their budgets had passed.

Moving forward, the Government intend to end the capping regime and replace it with a more democratic and localist measure to allow local residents to veto excessive council tax rises via a local referendum.

1 Alternative notional amounts apply to all classes of authority except for fire and rescue authorities.

2 Unlike other authorities, the GLA calculates two basic amounts of council tax; one under section 88(2) of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and one under section 89(3) of that Act.

3 SI 2008/3022. Central Bedfordshire and Shropshire were established on 1 April 2009. In order to equalise council tax more fairly in their areas, part 4 of SI 2008/3022 enables the authorities to calculate different basic amounts of council tax for their predecessor areas for up to five financial years. By contrast all other authorities (except the GLA) must calculate only one basic amount of council tax.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,9-Feb-2011,,,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/1871250,Council Tax freeze 2011 to 2012,"* * *

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr. Eric Pickles):

I am pleased to inform the House that all eligible local, fire and rescue and police authorities in England have decided to freeze or reduce their Band D council tax in 2011-12 and will therefore all be eligible to receive the additional grant offered by the Government for doing so. The average Band D rate of council tax will remain at £1,439 - a change of 0 per cent. This is the lowest ever change in the entire history of council tax. It represents a cash terms freeze, and a real terms cut in council tax. The capping threshold in recent years was a 5 per cent council tax rise. Stopping such a rise this year saves a typical household up to £72 and if an average 2.5 per cent rise had occurred the saving would have been £36.

Council taxpayers in some areas may see a small cash increase in their overall bill due to precept increases set by town and parish councils; central government has no remit over such precepts. However, nationally, this is offset by some councils which are making cash terms reductions to council tax levels.

The Government has delivered on its promise to work with authorities to produce a council tax freeze in England, which is tremendous news for hard working families and pensioners who have experienced a doubling of council tax since 1997.

The Spending Review made £650 million available for the council tax freeze. Where an authority has not increased its basic amount of council tax in 2011-12 compared with 2010-11, it will receive a grant equivalent to a 2.5 per cent increase in its 2010-11 Band D figure multiplied by the latest available tax base figure.

My Department will write to individual local authorities this week informing them of the amount of freeze grant I propose to pay to them during 2011-12. I intend the grant to be paid in ten equal monthly instalments from April 2011 through to January 2012. Following the 100 per cent response to the freeze by eligible authorities, no further capping action is required in 2011-12.

Although the council tax freeze is only for one year, financial provision is made to support the freeze across the Spending Review. This will 'lock in' the benefits of this year's freeze over each year over the Spending Review.

Moving forward, the Localism Bill makes provision for the abolition of central government capping powers, replacing them with new, binding council tax referendums from 2012-13 whenever an authority is proposing an excessive increase.

The Government has also protected families from potential increases in council tax by ruling out a council tax revaluation in England for the remainder of this Parliament. The Localism Bill also legislates to abolish bin taxes - which would have entailed new charges for household waste collections for many families on top of council tax.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,23-Mar-2011,,,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/2044923,Delivering better for less locally,"* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Thank you. I am delighted to be here today.

This conference offers a stimulating agenda, which I hope will provide you with ideas on how to meet the challenge of deliver Better for Less.

But exchanging ideas and information is just the first step. We need to use events like today not just to be inspired by the best, but to develop firm plans to improve efficiency and services.

I recognise that this is a testing time for local government. But tackling the deficit, and continuing to ensure economic recovery, is the most pressing issue facing Britain today.

Local government accounts for around a quarter of all public expenditure and it is right therefore that local authorities play their part in that recovery.

But in order to meet these economic challenges, local authorities need to become ever more efficient across all services.

There is no guarantee local government budgets will stay the same in the future, but the public will expect all levels of government to continue to deliver quality services.

This is not just about working with smaller budgets. It is about improving productivity - seeking out new and innovative ways of providing or transforming public services. Many councils have already successfully delivered savings, whilst continuing to provide quality services for their communities. However there is still much more that can and must be done.

A core principle of the Open Public Services White Paper is wherever possible to bring a range of providers in, competing to offer better, responsive and more economic services.

The white paper, published over the summer, acknowledged that local government is ahead of central government and the wider public sector in terms of open commissioning.

But the challenge is now to extend open commissioning widely, to bring innovation and expertise in to the provision of local services, both for the community and individuals. The Government is determined to ensure that community groups and social enterprises, as well as the private sector will be able to bid for public sector contracts.

We have already announced a package of measures to help them do so:

  * Contracts Finder - a one stop shop to find procurement opportunities, tender documents and contracts online, free of charge. Over 1600 contracts have been awarded to small and medium sized businesses via this route to date.
  * Simplified 'pre-qualification questionnaire', which means, through contracts finders, suppliers now only need to tell us prequalification data once.
  * There is evidence that the value of local authority contracts going to third parties, including the Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) and the private sector is going up year on year - third party contracts accounted for 29 per cent of local authority service expenditure in 2009-10 according to DCLG data. The White Paper sets out ways that local authorities can open up its commissioning approaches to new areas, and decentralise further.

Of course, each local authority must find its own solutions.

This is not about central government telling it how or what it should do. That is now a localist matter. But the days when there was a monopoly in the provision of services are over, and growing evidence that as long as they are delivered to the highest standards, people are indifferent to who they are provided by.

We are, therefore, breaking down barriers that stop councils, local charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups working together, sharing responsibilities and budgets for the benefit of those who need their help.

I know that many local authorities have taken up the challenge to deliver better services for less money. 'Authorities are doing everything they can to become more efficient and make taxpayers' money go further.

Still, there are a multitude of things councils can do to deliver significant savings and protect frontline services, such as:

  * Cutting out waste
  * carrying out smarter procurement
  * sharing services
  * more effective management of assets and capital investment
  * reducing fraud.

Many councils have already started on some of these, but, if I may, I would just like to cite some examples of what is being and can be achieved.

Starting with better procurement. Local government spends £50 billion a year on outside contracts and has the spending power of Tesco. Through working collaboratively with other local authorities and other bodies, private and public to procure and deliver services, significant reductions in expenditure can be made.

The North East Improvement and Efficiency Partnership, for example, is using a strategic plan to maximise the social, economic and environmental impact of procurement and saving £70 million over five years. This entails up-skilling local authority procurement teams; introducing common policies and practices; and fully engaging with suppliers.

Significant savings can be leveraged from reducing the costs of management and support services.

Building on existing collaborative working arrangements, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire County Councils have integrated all back office support services - with an estimated saving of £2.5 million each year.

Sharing resources - with other councils and organisations in the public, private and voluntary and community sectors - will help reduce the costs of delivering services by removing some of the duplication.

With Cllr Cockell beside me, I must point immediately to the co-operation which is taking place between Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham and Westminster Council's, in bringing together various aspects of administration and services, including having one Chief Executive for all three Councils, sharing back office functions and combining services and staff.

In Herefordshire, the unitary council, primary care trust and local NHS have shared a chief executive, a management team and corporate plan since 2008. The three partners expect net savings of more than £33 million over 10 years.

I fully recognise that it is a grinding of teeth issue to invoke good examples - and many of you will say ""Well, we're doing that, too."" Good. I am glad you are, but for those who are not, these provide examples of successful leadership.

The local government estate is worth around £250 billion. A recent independent report estimated that local authorities could deliver up to £7 billion in savings per year, and at the same time improve services, by managing their property assets efficiently, and in co-operation with other public and voluntary sector organisations.

For over a year, my Department has been working closely with 11 Capital and Asset Pathfinders to explore what can be achieved. The initial projects have shown that adopting a cross-public sector approach can lead to substantial savings and improve the local community's access to the services they need.

The Local Government Association are now leading a second wave of Pathfinders to see what further lessons can be learnt.

45 areas have submitted an expression of interest to take forward neighbourhood-level Community Budgets.

A further two areas will design and run a 'whole place' programme to test how all public services can be integrated and managed as a single local budget. 15 areas have applied to take this forward.

The concept of Community Budgets, is about bringing together and pooling the resources of various public bodies to provide the best services for individuals who need them, whether by the public, private or voluntary sectors.

As the Secretary of State said at the recent launch of the Community Budgets Prospectus, ""We can no longer afford the luxury of fruitless, uncoordinated investment.""

Community Budgets are not about any one local public service having a monopoly on action or resources. Nor are they about central Government mandating what localities should do.

They are to give people more power over the local services and resources that are delivered in their neighbourhood and that matter most to them.

Each pilot will seek to establish devolved budget and policy making structures to secure better coordinated, more efficient, services for residents. This can help government to make significant public sector savings, cut red tape and improve policy making.

I have been working with a small number of Council Leaders to look at the barriers standing in the way of achieving this. We discovered that nearly all barriers were at the local level, and were cultural rather than legal. Many details of what we found are already online, including a definitive and practical guide about data sharing that shows how you really can 'dare to share'.

The challenge is there for the areas to bring the pilots to life and tell us how local services can be better run.

A significant recent development has been the Prime Minister's commitment to turn around the lives of the most troubled families, by the end of this Parliament. This will truly mean all agencies working together, sharing information, identifying families with the most difficult and intractable problems.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has been asked to provide the support for this initiative. The Troubled families team is headed up by Louise Casey.

Around 100 councils have already signed up to become involved in the initial stages of these projects.

I know there are many examples of local authorities who have embraced the challenge of delivering 'Better for Less'.

In closing, I want to make it clear that I do not underestimate the economic challenges facing local authorities and the wider public sector. Nor, the effort that they are already having to make to continue with their ambitions.

However, many local authorities and other public bodies have already demonstrated that not only can significant efficiency savings be achieved but frontline services can be protected, by rigorous thinking. about the future way of serving their communities.

But I believe that more can be done, particularly now the opportunities for innovative practices have opened up, by the devolvement of power, resources and authority to Local Government.

Events like today provide an excellent opportunity to come together and learn from one another's experiences. I am sure you will leave the conference today inspired with new ideas and solutions for dealing with all these challenges.

I believe that it is essential for the future of truly localist local government that you are seen to lead the way. I am certain you can do so.

Today the Department for Communities and Local Government is announcing the local authority allocations for the Disabled Facilities Grant programme in England, making available £180m, an increase of £11m on the amount allocated for 2010-11. Local authorities are being informed of their individual allocations. Details of the amount awarded to each authority will be available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website and a table detailing the funds provided to individual authorities has been placed in the Library of the House.

The Disabled Facilities Grant programme has been protected within the spending review. The programme helps disabled people to live as comfortably and independently as possible in their own homes through the provision of adaptations. Entitlement to a Disabled Facilities Grant is mandatory for eligible disabled people and the grant provides financial assistance for the provision of a wide range of housing adaptations ranging from stair lifts, level access showers and home extensions. The programme is therefore key in delivering the Government's objective of providing increased levels of care and support to people in their own homes.

The Department for Communities and Local Government wrote to all local authorities in January 2011 to announce a small change to the allocation methodology for the Disabled Facilities Grant for the financial year 2011-12. In 2011-12 there is £180m available to be distributed as Disabled Facilities Grant to local authorities - an extra £11m more than was available in 2010-11. All local authorities will, as a minimum, receive what they were allocated in 2010-11. The extra £11m will then be shared between the local authorities using a relative needs weighted index.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

It's a pleasure to be here today to confirm and celebrate the first new local enterprise partnerships, and mark what is, I believe, a pivotal moment for local government.

### Context

The difficult decisions set out in last week's Spending Review are vital if we are to reduce the deficit and put Britain's finances on a sound footing. Like the rest of the public sector, local authorities must adapt to constrained budgets. No-one in Whitehall underestimates the scale of change this implies for town halls. It means not only working as hard as possible to eliminate unnecessary waste and duplication, but also rethinking many forms of service and ways of working from scratch. Even for the most forward-thinking and advanced councils today will need to be doing things differently in four years' time from how they do them now.

But the counterpart to constraint of one kind - economic constraint - is freedom of another kind - freedom to lead, to innovate, and to exercise choice. This government is committed to achieving a fundamental shift in the way the country is governed. We want to pass unprecedented power and influence to a local level. Instead of being agents for the local delivery of Whitehall's priorities, local authorities should wield genuine power and responsibility, with the flexibility to listen and respond to local people's hopes and ambitions for the place where they live.

That's why we are radically reducing targets, removing centrally-imposed strategies, stripping out unnecessary bureaucracy and freeing up local funding from the vast majority of conditions and ties. This is opening up space in which local authorities can exercise the leadership, ingenuity and imagination to adapt to changing times. The best and most ambitious will be seeking not only to protect or prioritise, but also, wherever possible, to improve frontline services. Many authorities are taking a sound approach by asking fundamental questions about what they do and how they do it. Proposals from Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea to pool a wide range of functions and services are only the boldest of a multitude of innovative plans being considered by different authorities across the country - including sharing chief executives; bringing together services such as health and social care to deliver better results at lower cost; and inviting the charity and voluntary sector to play a greater role in the delivery of services.

### Economic imbalance

Local enterprise partnerships sit in this same tradition of locally-led innovation. They represent part of the solution to the most pressing challenge facing the country as a whole, and that, of course, is putting the economy back on a firm footing for the long term.

Last week, the Governor of the Bank of England summarised it like this:

> ""After an unprecedented financial crisis and deep recession, the UK economy needs to rebalance.""

Compare with what my colleague the Business Secretary said in June:

> ""(we have) an economy that is seriously unbalanced both in its sectoral mix and in its regions.""

Three facts bring this imbalance home.

First, financial and business services have been Britain's single largest sector of the economy since 1990. They play a bigger role in Britain's economy than they do in France, Germany, the US or Japan, and still account for a bigger share of national GDP than manufacturing. The financial and business service sector has an important role in a renewed economy. Historically, however, at its most successful, Britain has excelled in not one area of economic activity, but many: technology, trade, communications, construction - and we cannot expect financial and business services alone to shoulder the responsibility for driving growth today.

Second, there is significant geographic imbalance in Britain's economy. Only a handful of other cities among the OECD countries - including Seoul, Budapest, Bratislava and Dublin - dominate their national economy to a similar extent.

On one hand this is a huge asset. As the CEO of one global bank put it to me, ""the dominance of the City of London is a problem that France and Germany would love to have."" On the other hand, while London and the South East forge ahead, other parts of England grow far more slowly, and evidence suggests that this geographic imbalance is growing over time. I want our other great cities like Leeds and Liverpool to be economic powerhouses in their own right.

Third, even in the wealthiest areas, there remain significant pockets of unemployment and deprivation. Whatever the differences in economic performance between broadly defined parts of the country, the differences between different towns and neighbourhoods are also often great. Tower Hamlets, in the shadow of Canary Wharf, has three quarters of children growing up in low-income families.

### The drawbacks of regional development agencies

This government's vision is to achieve growth that is sustainable and long-lasting, that flourishes in every part of the country, and which leads to a more diverse, and therefore more resilient, economy.

This is the vision set out in our White Paper on Local Economic Growth published today.  
   
When this government came to power, some of the vehicles in place to deal with this challenge were simply not up to the task. Take, in particular, the Regional Development Agencies, the previous government's chosen method to promote growth in different parts of England. Despite the hard work and good faith of the people who worked in them, these were organisations that were flawed in theory, and ineffective in practice.

First, their boundaries simply didn't reflect how economies work. It is wishful thinking to imagine that there can be a common solution to the challenges faced by a hotelier on the Isles of Scilly and a commuter from Clifton; or between a Hastings fisherman and a entrepreneur in Milton Keynes, yet this is precisely what the design of Regional Development Agencies implied. Meanwhile, the Thames Estuary - with all its towns and communities and businesses sharing a common interest in inward investment and the development of transport links - was divided between three different regions.

Second, rather than arising from the grass roots up, Regional Development Agencies were imposed from the top down. Their very design was a reflection of Whitehall's ambitions and plans more than they were of local aspirations and needs. As my colleague in the Business Department, Mark Prisk has said - they ""lacked any real democratic accountability to the citizens they (were) supposed to serve."" In some areas this led to a lack of real connection with local businesses, and a sense of disempowerment, frustration, and of being ""done to"", rather than encouragement to take initiative.

But the problem isn't just that the Agencies were based on false premisses, they didn't even succeed on their own terms - that is, to close the gap between the economic performance of London and the South East, and the rest of the country. For the period between 1990 and 1998, the gap between the growth in Gross Value Added of the Greater South East, and the growth of the rest of England stood at 0.6 percentage points. Between 1999 and 2008 - the Regional Development Agencies' first nine years - the gap was a familiar 0.6 percentage points.

If only the measure of success had been the rate of production of documents instead. I don't want to pick on any one Agency, but the reader hungry for details of the South West Regional Development Agency's activities is spoilt for choice.

You might whet your appetite with the 'Regional Economic Strategy for 2006-2015'; move on to 'A Delivery Framework for 2006-2009', then progress to a 'Spatial Implications' paper called 'Place Matters'.

You could stop there and refresh your palate with a 'reference guide', before tackling the 'evidence base refresh', the 'summary of consultations' and 'the environmental report'.

For afters, why not try the 'Commentary on the extent to which the Sustainability Appraisal recommendations have been integrated into the finalised regional economic strategy', the 'corporate plan 2008', or the 'updated corporate plan 2009-2011' - which bears the interesting title, 'What now?'

Finally, if you're still not satisfied, there are the annual reports and accounts to plough through. In some years, the Agency produced an annual review too. You may be wondering - what is the difference between the annual report and an annual review? Let me tell you: a report has tables - a review has pictures. And very pretty they are too.

I'm not questioning the idea that public bodies should report on their actions. Proper accountability is only possible when taxpayers have clear and accessible information about where their money is going.

But this is just part of the output of just one of nine agencies. Imagine all these documents, or similar, multiplied by nine. It's a mountain of paperwork next to a molehill of achievements.

### Local enterprise partnerships - the principles

We propose to remove the tier of artificial regions, get rid of the bureaucracy, and return power to the local level and into the hands of local people, local organisations and local businesses. Over the summer we challenged them to come forward with proposals for joint working on economic priorities.

In essence, the idea behind these local enterprise partnerships is straightforward. It's about bringing people together - local authorities from across administrative divides, business leaders and civic leaders with their different experiences and viewpoints - in a common goal: to promote jobs, growth and prosperity in their local area.

But in other ways, these partnerships represent a significant departure from the old approach.

First, local enterprise partnerships truly are locally led. We deliberately chose to keep guidance and strictures about what proposals should look like to a minimum. Ultimately, we in Whitehall don't presume to know better than local businesses and civic leaders what's needed at a local level. Some, at first, found this challenging. What exactly should our bid look like? What process should we follow? Will there be more guidance? There's a certain comfort in being told what to do and, frankly, some authorities have grown too accustomed to relying on instructions. That's not our view of good governance. The opportunity of local leadership lies in taking responsibility and exercising control, and the best proposals have demonstrated just that.

Second, these partnerships are about working in new and better ways; they are not simply a means for securing supplementary resources. We envisage, for example, that partnerships will be able to bid for the £1.4bn Regional Growth Fund, but will not receive preferential treatment over other eligible bids. Rather, the key to their success will lie in pooling resources and sovereignty - such as planning powers - to achieve efficiencies, and make limited resources deliver bigger changes. In many cases authorities will already be able to get on with closer joint working right away but where they encounter specific barriers to growth, we in Whitehall will do our part to remove those barriers, granting greater local discretion so that - for example - it's easier for partners to align funding and coordinate activity on major projects of common interest - whether it's housing, transport or skills. This is not, incidentally, the Department for Communities and Local Government saying one thing and other Departments carrying on with business as usual.

Here, for example, is what Phillip Hammond, the Transport Secretary said earlier this month:

> ""Once the partnerships are formed, I want to see how far my Department's local capital funding can be devolved.""

Third, these partnerships put the private sector at the very heart of efforts to drive local growth. Too often in the past there was a certain myopia about regeneration. The old remedy to poverty, deprivation and unemployment was the injection of large amounts of public money. But there was too little emphasis on such vital questions as - where are the entrepreneurs and businesses who are going to rent the new offices? Who's going to employ the people living in new homes?

As the Prime Minister said at the CBI earlier this week:

> ""The new jobs, the new products, the new ideas that will lift us up will be born in the factories and offices you own - not in the corridors of Whitehall.""

That's why we have insisted that local businesses must play a central role in the new partnerships and it's been truly encouraging to see that there has been great appetite to get involved. Every single bid that we are giving the go-ahead has strong local business involvement. The Members of the Chambers of Commerce both locally and nationally have been staunch supporters and that is very welcome indeed. And in many cases the chairs of partnerships are likely to be business big hitters: those already confirmed include Sir Terry Leahy, formerly of Tesco, in Liverpool; and Sandy Anderson, formerly of ICI, in the Tees Valley. There will be many more in the months to come.

### The partnerships - emerging proposals

Today, I'm delighted to be able to confirm that the first 24 partnerships are good to go forward. All share some common attributes. They are built on how areas think about themselves, how they relate to each other, and genuine shared interest - not on an arbitrary Whitehall blueprint. They have a strong level of business engagement. They are testament to local ambition and ingenuity, and proof that central government does not need to micro-manage.

But they are also hugely diverse, reflecting the wide variety of different local needs across England. Some are rural, some urban. Some North, some South.

Some cover areas with very significant populations - some 3 million people live in the Leeds City Region, for example - while others have a very large geographic spread, such as 'Coast to Capital', reaching from Brighton to Croydon.

Some are cities, such as Manchester or Sheffield, who want to match a proud industrial heritage with a strong modern economy by encouraging industry and joining up centres of employment and enterprise with residential areas.

Others, such Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, see a role in fostering tourism; and others, such as Oxfordshire City Region, want to make the most of the presence of world-class centres of scholarship, research and innovation.

Taken together, these 24 partnerships represent:

  * £518bn, or 54 per cent of England's Gross Value Added
  * 1.1m, or 57 per cent of all businesses in England
  * 13m employees, or 58 per cent of all employees in England; and
  * a population of 31m, or 60 per cent of England's population.

Without wanting to be invidious, I'm particularly taken by some of the areas which illustrate true local vision and determination.

**The Kent, Essex and East Sussex** partnership has the potential to be an economic powerhouse which will help develop the Thames Estuary, and could create more than 100,000 jobs in the longer term; but it will also drive the regeneration of historic seaside towns such as Hastings, Margate, Ramsgate and Southend.

**The Thames Valley Berkshire** proposals, which cover towns such as Reading, Slough and Windsor, will focus on improving transport links and infrastructure, boosting skills and improving the supply of housing.

And the **Tees Valley Unlimited proposals** have been put forward with great energy, and could really put Teesside on the map, making the most of the area's immense potential and its local strengths in petrochemicals, port services and the biotechnology sector.

I very much look forward to seeing these and all the other proposals come to fruition.

### Next Steps

So, what happens next? To the partnerships who have had the go ahead today, the message is simple: the ball is in their court. It is now for them to recruit their boards, set their priorities, and begin their conversations with the department about how we can help by removing barriers and passing greater control from the centre.

Let me be clear, though. The announcement of 24 areas today is a beginning, not an end. For those proposals which did not quite make it this time - we hope that they will draw inspiration from what is possible, and we will continue to support them as they refine their plans. And any other area that wants to have a local enterprise partnership that suits business and community aspirations can come forward with proposals at any time.

Of course, in many ways, for the bids that have been cleared, the hard work is only just beginning. Their results will reflect the effort that goes into building and maintaining relationships at a local level between public bodies, the private sector, voluntary and charitable groups and more. Their achievements will be in proportion to the ambition of what local partnerships ask of us in central government, and our commitment in removing barriers and constraints.

In sum, this is a unique moment of challenge and opportunity for all of us, and what we do and achieve over the coming months will, in the end, be a test of our collective commitment to a better way of governing and driving local growth in every part of England.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I would like to start by thanking Councillor David Parsons (CBE) for inviting me to speak to you here in Nottingham at the inaugural meeting of the East Midlands Councils. I am delighted that you have come together in this way.

With my strong Local Government background I was very pleased to be appointed by the Prime Minister as the Under Secretary of State at Communities and Local Government as part of the new coalition Government.

As you will know, the Government has an ambitious legislative programme for this parliamentary session. As is only fitting to meet the scale of the challenges facing the country.

Devolving power to individuals and local communities lies at the heart of the Coalition Government's ambitions. Both the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have clearly laid out the Government's priorities in the coalition agreement, emphasising that the days of Big Government are over and our commitment to localism.

As the Prime Minster said in Liverpool on Monday, one of things we need to do to create the Big Society is to 'push power away from central government' to local government and beyond to communities, to neighbourhoods, and individuals.

Our approach is built on empowering, rather than disempowering, citizens and communities.

We realise that Whitehall does not necessarily know best.

And it is for this reason that people must have a genuine voice. They must have a reason to get involved and a sense of responsibility for their neighbourhood.

Key to this process will be moving from a system in which local authorities report primarily to central government and are the subject of many inspectorates, to new arrangements where councils listen to and support local people, focussing on what they want for their communities.

Looking back across the years (and I know because I have done it!) you will have seen ministers standing before meetings like this, promising to give power to you, but never quite getting round to it. Keeping their hands on the minutiae of management. So why should this time be different?

Five reasons:

  * firstly, because David Cameron didn't make decentralisation a theme of his election campaign but the theme - Big Society is his vision, and his determination to see it implemented now governs all that we do
  * secondly, the Big Society forms the basis of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, with a common commitment to localism forming the tightest bond between the two parties
  * thirdly, with our Secretary of State and also the Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark, localism and decentralisation have true champions across government who are determined that this time power will pass to individual citizens and to local areas
  * fourthly we're already getting on with the job. We've ended HIPs, cut ring fencing of grants to local authorities, ended CAA and announced the abolition of the regional quangos and Regional Spatial Strategies, Regional Development Agencies and the Government Offices. Local authorities and local communities will now take the decisions on local matters themselves such as the number of houses to be built in their area
  * fifthly, as announced in the Queen's Speech, we will shortly introduce the Decentralisation and Localism Bill. This will be a large, landmark piece of legislation. Indeed, I challenge anyone to find anything on the statute book that transfers more power from central to local government than is the case with this Bill.

The Bill will see a further shift of power from regional bodies like Regional Development Agencies to new Local Enterprise Partnerships, which, together with proposals for a general power of competence will help to let local government ensure that business, health and other public bodies can come together across boundaries if need be to develop and deliver policies which need their combined effort to be truly effective.

CLG's structural reform plan also places localism at the heart of our thinking. Over the next 18 months in Government we will deliver decentralising reforms, handing over power to town halls, we will publish information and bring transparency to what we do so that information is readily available to those who want it. Local Government too will be publishing data on its work after January 2011.

You will have heard this already, but as a Treasury minister in the former government made clear, ""there is no money left"". You will know too of the economic realities of that statement.

However, we believe that local government and local people are ideally placed to make best use of the money that is available, and we are determined to make sure that you have the power to do so.

According to a study for the European Central Bank, highly decentralised countries like the US, Australia, Japan and Switzerland are twenty per cent more efficient than we are.

We know that in the current fiscal state we will all need to make great changes to the way we work to ensure that we continue to meet the demands and expectations of our local communities.

This means doing everything we can to increase efficiency and savings - reducing costs, cutting out waste and working better together.

Do you know where all of your money goes?

Do you know what your future demands are, and are likely to cost?

Do you challenge your suppliers to ensure value for money, even if that means sitting down mid-contract and negotiating the right pricing for services?

Are you transparent in providing information to the public on what you are spending their money on?

These are the questions I ask my Department where we are scouring all of our current contracts for savings. Indeed our Secretary of State makes a regular plea of ""Show me the money!"".

I am not going to stand here and tell you that this is a Eureka moment. I am only too aware that good practice already exists in many areas and that some excellent work is already taking place in this region, for example in Lincolnshire, where councils are already procuring together and sharing legal services.

As you know, Lincolnshire County Council have devised a Lincolnshire Procurement card which streamlines the purchase ordering process across seven district councils and the Health Service in Lincolnshire which has resulted in over £1million of savings and additional benefits in quicker processes and improved supplier relations.

And High Peak and Staffordshire Moorlands, who are sharing a chief executive, a management team and a number of key services - reducing costs and improving the quality of local services.

In Leicestershire local services have come together to look at how, through greater collaboration and a greater focus on the needs of the local area, access to services can be improved and drugs and alcohol abuse can be tackled across a wide range of partner organisations.

You will know this, I don't really need to tell you about it, but these are excellent examples of good practice.

But this is not just about savings - we must not lose sight that even with radical transformation we still need to ensure that local and vulnerable people are not starved of funds on which they rely.

This is not at all easy, so it is helpful to know that the LGA's 'place based productivity' programme is providing a key to identifying innovative approaches such as these to help to support more councils in moving to creating and delivering opportunities.

I commend the LGA for aiming to deliver this programme to a timetable that is congruent with the work you are all having to do now to review your budgets, to anticipate budget gaps, to manage pressures.

So where do we go from here?

CLG's job is to arrange an orderly transition of power away from the centre.

And to provide you with enough freedom and flexibility to do your job in the most efficient and effective way rather than placing barriers, bureaucracy and restrictions in your way.

Next week, Greg Clark will be delivering his objectives on Government's latest thinking around decentralisation and how this will change the way that Whitehall operates.

I would like to reinforce the message that decentralisation is a cross government agenda - the political landscape is shifting both nationally and locally - in local Government, the Health Service, and Education to name a few.

CLG can hold the torch but it cannot create this fundamental change alone. It will take a combined approach and the efforts of many people - in fact everybody - to ensure that we decentralise the state and build a Big Society based on our values of freedom, fairness and responsibility.

And you - in local Government - are one of the lynch pins in that. Your enthusiasm to grasp the opportunities will be central to it's success.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/articles/newsroom/1706200,Economy needs local remedies not regional prescription,"* * *

**On the closing day for submitting local enterprise partnership proposals Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Business Secretary Vince Cable explain that a recovering economy needs local remedies not regional prescription.**

We have a massive inherited problem sorting out the budget deficit and an economy that has become badly unbalanced. Too much growth, wealth and prosperity is concentrated in just one part of the country, the South-East. We have been too reliant on financial services and booming house prices, we have neglected manufacturing, and we have saved and invested too little.

Fixing this mess is a phenomenal challenge - and in its regional structures the last government bequeathed a cumbersome and undemocratic bureaucracy that is unfit for the task. Regional Development Agencies focused on bidding for and spending Whitehall money. They are too cumbersome, costly and unrepresentative to get us through the current economic crisis. A country arbitrarily divided into unnatural blocks such as the 'South-West' and the 'East Midlands' runs against the economic grain. But nor can ministers rebalance economies as diverse as those of Leeds, Liverpool and Tees Valley from our offices in Whitehall.

Our two departments are working together to deal with the mess. A key element of the coalition strategy are the local enterprise partnerships that will radically reshape the way business and government interact at the local level. It marks a sharp break from the top-down, politically driven regional policy of the last government.

The secret to success is natural local economies - not artificial political regions - that better reflect the natural economic geography of the areas they serve. This is an economic problem that needs an economic solution, not a political one. So we asked businesses and councils from Cornwall to Carlisle how they should work. There has been an enthusiastic response. Ministers will now review these ideas to select those that have the strongest commitment to enterprise and to working in partnership.

How will they form? That is a question that, thankfully, cannot be answered in a Whitehall-written press release. The answers will be as varied as England itself is varied, reflecting the diverse circumstances and strengths around the country.

In many places, the natural economic unit may be the city region - Greater Manchester, for example, already has a strong record of working across many local authority boundaries. With local ideas for improving skills, tourism, the transition to a low carbon economy and inward investment, this is the kind of creativity that a Whitehall-built bureaucratic blueprint would shackle with a one-size-fits-all solution.

Universities will also play a vital part - for example, hubs of excellence in areas such as avionics and chemical engineering can be found across the north-west of England. Improving the way bright scientific ideas are turned into excellent businesses is going to be vital for our long-term growth - but we have no chance of making it happen if the local economy cannot bring commerce and academia closer together. Nottingham University is closely involved in its local proposal.

There are many parts of the country where a sense of identity crosses over many local authority areas, such as in parts of the North-East, and this is reflected in the proposals. Elsewhere, as in the West Midlands, business is anxious to create a structure that reflects the interconnected character of this manufacturing heartland.

Local enterprise partnerships can also transform the economic geography of the country - unconstrained by arbitrary boundaries and top-down prescription that did not work. Some of the local enterprise proposals are likely to cross traditional regional boundaries, such as the partnership of Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes and Aylesbury Vale, which stretches over the East and South-East borders, with an open door for any other neighbouring authority areas to join.

Business leadership in local enterprise partnerships is critical. We have met many leading groups including the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the British Chambers of Commerce, which all contributed their thoughts on how it should work. Local enterprise partnerships are not about making businesses dance to an arbitrary local tune, but precisely the opposite. The bureaucracy of regional development agencies gave local authorities little reason to engage creatively with business - preventing them from seeing how closely their interests were aligned. Local enterprise partnerships are a way of tying their interests together, and providing local representatives with an effective way of getting involved in and helping with the business agenda.

What will local enterprise partnerships do? The RDAs have wasted a lot of money duplicating activities. Trade and investment promotion, strategic investment and innovation and business support will in future be led nationally. This still leaves much scope for local initiative to promote enterprise. The outcome may be as varied, as the local economic priorities vary. In some areas, there might be a focus on skills, an essential element in re-tooling the economy towards higher-value activities. In others, the local enterprise partnerships may be means by which planning decisions are unblocked. The problem with the current planning system is that there is no local buy-in to important decisions, no sense of democratic accountability, which understandably leaves households nervous about the impact of decisions on their community. Instead of the top-down structures of Labour, this government has proposed ideas such as the Community Right to Build, which will enable planning applications to go through faster because they come with a fair wind of local support.

Other areas may have their focus determined by a particular strength - for example, the manufacturing and automotive excellence in the Midlands that spread across hundreds of companies, big and small, ought to play a big role in setting its local economic agenda.

There is not one national standard for all to follow. One size does not fit all. Our commitment is to stop central government and regional quangos second-guessing the needs of local business, in ways that stifle initiative and entrepreneurship. Today our message to councils and business is simply: be radical and be ambitious. We believe the promotion of enterprise requires local solutions. Now local partnerships must prove it.

A number of councils are risking their reputations by salami slicing jobs and slashing services without cutting out all the waste first.

This is unfair to the majority of councils who have gone about responsibly balancing their books and protecting the frontline services we all rely on.

Here is how councils can help:

First, club together to share back-office staff. There is no need for every single council to have their own payroll or legal teams. Many councils are now joining forces, saving us hundreds of millions of pounds.

Secondly, they can show you what they are spending online so that you, the taxpayer, can see exactly where your money is going and can shout if you aren't happy. Councils will be a lot more wary about splashing the cash if they know their excesses cannot be hidden away.

Third, crack down on top boss pay - leading by example. Some chief executives are being paid huge wages. But many are taking a pay cut because of public pressure - or sharing these officials with other councils which gives them better value for money.

Fourth, spend smarter. Every penny counts but some councils are paying way over the odds. Some spend about £2 on a packet of envelopes - some even spend £9. There's really no excuse for it.

And finally, altogether councils have about £10bn of your money sat in their bank accounts for a rainy day. Well, it's raining. We all have to dip into our savings when things get tight to tide us over. Councils should too.

Every council should be working their way through this checklist before the thought of cutting bin collections or children's services even crosses their minds. These few councils are really letting the side down and undermining the fantastic work that's going on elsewhere.

It's time to cut out the waste, everywhere.

For every two families needing a home in this country, there is one property standing empty.

It has been a determination of mine for a long time that we end the scandalous situation where we have families across the country on waiting lists, looking for a home of their own, yet there are at least 300,000 long-term empty properties.

So, this week, I got around the table with some of the key people who know about the problem, and who have first-hand experience of tackling it, to find out exactly what more needs to be done to breathe life back into these houses.

> ""There are more than 300,000 empty properties which could provide good-quality family homes, and help breath life back into neighbourhoods.""

What quickly became obvious was that there are some great examples across the country of work taking place to bring a significant number of properties back into use, and which demonstrate the practical benefits of working in partnership.

When homes are brought back into use, not only does another family get their own home and the council and community benefit financially, wider savings are made. An occupied home doesn't attract vandals and squatters, and generates fewer calls to the police and fire service.

Bringing a home back into use can even be used as a practical base for construction and training courses.

So, in Bolton, for example, the council proactively makes contact with the owners of properties which have been derelict for a significant period of time, and discusses with them the background to the property, the reasons for it being empty, and how they can be supported to renovate, sell the property, or rent it out.

This approach has resulted in more than 200 properties being brought back into use, ridding popular residential areas of the crime and anti-social behaviour that blighted them.

The Canopy project in Leeds is a community housing scheme which renovates derelict and empty houses to create decent homes for homeless people - and by them working on the project themselves, they learn fresh skills and develop a new confidence, community barriers are broken down, and big improvements to local neighbourhoods are made.

I want to see more of these projects - ones that deliver both new homes and opportunities.

The powerful financial incentives we have introduced, the new voice we have given to communities so that they have a greater say on the properties which need action in their area, and the practical online resources we have made available should allow this to happen.

The £100m 'empty homes fund' is available to local authorities, house-builders and developers, affordable housing providers and local community groups, which can all bid for a share of the funding to bring long-term empty properties - which would not come back into use without intervention - to become homes once again.

Under the new homes bonus, we are matching council tax collected from a property that previously stood empty. For every property renovated, the extra council tax will be matched for six years - so, if 10 typical houses are brought back into use, the community will receive almost £100,000 of extra funding from the Government - with the extra funding spent to benefit the local community, whether on council tax discounts, boosting local services, renovating more empty properties or improving local facilities. But, where legal action needs to be taken, councils can use 'empty dwelling management' orders on properties which have been unoccupied for more than two years and which cause a nuisance to neighbours - giving communities their say on the need to take action. These orders allow councils to take over an empty property, make whatever repairs are necessary, and rent it out to a family in need. Owners of empty properties will now be given a minimum of three months' notice that an order will be requested, giving them a last-chance warning to make changes and bring their homes back into use before the council can apply for an empty dwelling management order.

To make it easier for communities and councils to identify and tackle the empty homes in their area, we have brought forward two new toolkits. An online mapping toolkit plots the location of long-term empty homes in each area, alongside information on local housing need - such as those in temporary accommodation and on waiting lists, and levels of crime and anti-social behaviour. It is a valuable tool which allows councils to pinpoint and prioritise the 'hot spots' in their area.

And a new 'one-stop shop' knowledge toolkit brings together information on the relevant legislative framework and investment mechanisms, and know-how on partnership building, and gives empty property owners, landlords and the wider community access to everything they need to know about bringing properties back into use.

We are playing our part, and many areas continue to play theirs, but more must step up work to tackle the empty homes which shame us all, at the same time making use of the help and support available from the Government.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I am delighted to be here today to see for myself that you are taking up the challenge of this new Coalition government and thinking seriously about how you can work differently within your local areas in the context of localism and Big Society.

I know that councils in the South East have a reputation of rising to a challenge and that you have already started to think about some of those big things that will produce efficiencies and savings without compromising the quality of services you provide.

I have been interested in the work that Kent and Hampshire have been doing on capital and assets and leading the way on big procurement contracts. I know that others have been getting involved in that.

I am hearted by the desire to think differently about sharing Chief Executives and management teams like in East Hampshire and Havant, and Vale of White Horse and South Oxfordshire.

But there is a far greater potential for more joint working in the public sector, including the sharing of back office functions. We will support greater cooperation between councils and other local public bodies.

You and I both know that we find ourselves facing tough choices around funding, and this needs to be balanced with the protection of front line services.

We have been left with a legacy that means we can either give up and say that cuts in government spending mean worse services for people. Or we can rise to the challenge and say that we can sort this in a radical and creative way.

I want us to do the latter.

And that means we need to start by giving local people and those they elected to represent them, that's you councillors, the wherewithal to change the way that services are delivered.

Localism isn't just about a better conversation between Whitehall and local councils. It's about a fundamental shift in the balance of power in this country and that is why we are bold enough to say that we must put the power right back to the people who elected us.

And we mean it.

People must have a genuine voice. A reason to get involved. A sense of responsibility for their neighbourhood.

We can't any longer get away with Whitehall trying to dictate to local people what they want or can have. They must be able to have some control over that decision making themselves and you, as local leaders, need to help them with that.

That is why we have made things easier for you. To free you up to focus on what really matters in your area and cutting the bureaucracy that was stifling you.

In the 60 days that we have been in power we have showed that we listened to you and have got things done:

  * we have ended CAA
  * we have abolished Home Information Packs
  * we have handed back of powers to councils over garden grabbing and housing densities
  * we have scrapped regional strategies, regional assemblies and bins taxes
  * we have started to de-ring-fence more grants to give more local discretion over funding - with more to come
  * we have abolished the Standards Board for England, whilst ensuring that Councillors will remain answerable to their electorate

And we won't stop there.

Greg Clark has already asked you what further burdens you need help with lifting and I know that councils in the South East responded positively to this with some excellent ideas. We are taking those seriously.

As the Deputy Prime Minister said when he launched his campaign to promote 'your freedom'. ""For too long new laws and regulations have taken away people's freedoms, interfered in everyday life, and made it difficult for businesses to get by.""

We are doing something about that. We want to free you up so that you can make decisions in your local areas without worrying about some archaic piece of legislation that is preventing you from doing something sensible for your local people.

Going forward there will be less red-tape and greater public transparency and accountability - councils focusing on the frontline services that matter.

Transparency is vital for strong accountable local government. It is clear many councils have taken up the challenge since the Secretary of State wrote to council leaders at the beginning of June urging them to publish spend over £500. Windsor and Maidenhead are a good example of this and I know that other councils in the South East are following suit.

We must drive this agenda together. The best standards are ones worked up organically and collaboratively by those people that produce and use data - not ones imposed by arms-length committees. So I am grateful to those councils getting involved in the online debate around standards and challenges n this agenda. I am not underestimating those challenges. But it is not surprising that anything worth doing will test our resilience. But we all know that it is worth doing.

We will be judged on our ability to be open in sharing data with people - data about their money which the public sector spends, be it on salaries, expenses, services. And finally let's not forget the information which individuals can contribute back to councils - say on graffiti or fly tipping incidents. Citizens can be the councils' eyes and ears about how well your services are doing - they can feed your metrics and your own assessments for free.

And it's not just about transparency. This is just the start.

We said in the Coalition Agreement that we will ""promote a radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local government and community groups"". We want to make sure that we treat Local Government like grown-ups rather than insisting that a nanny state knows best.

So again we have showed that we will live up to our promises by:

  * introducing new incentives so local communities benefit directly from business and housing growth
  * implementing a review of local government finance
  * giving councils freedom to decide their own structures
  * building on the Sustainable Communities Act
  * we will work with local government to deliver a council tax freeze in 2011-12 while protecting vital local services
  * and, of course, a general power of competence.

As Eric Pickles said in his speech last week to the LGA conference, ""For the first time in decades, councillors have the chance to make real decisions.""

And we want to make it easier for you to do this.

Much of this will be done through our planned Localism Bill to devolve greater powers to councils and neighbourhoods and give local communities control over housing and planning decisions. It will help set the foundations for the Big Society by radically transforming the relationships between central government, local government, communities and individuals.

The changes that will at last mean that there will be clearer accountability to the people you serve.

But I want to end on the most important point of all. We've got to use this opportunity to usher in not just a shift of power but of culture.

We'll know we've been successful when it has become routine for local citizens - and for that matter the national media - to turn to locally-elected leaders for answers rather than the despatch box in Westminster. We want local deliverers to be much more accountable to the people they serve rather than thinking Whitehall knows best.

We have to ask those hard questions about whether we can shift power more directly into people's hands before we assume the state has the answer to their problems.

Because in the end, it's not really a matter of the centre letting go or councils taking the lead. It's not just a question of how much power can be shifted.

The culture needs to be changed. And people need to see and believe in that change.

There's a lot to be done to achieve this. But it is achievable and we need to work together to make it happen.

My colleagues and I are relying on you to take up this challenge to turn localism into a reality for you and your communities.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,"Local Government House, London",,,,16-Jul-2010,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,,,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today paid tribute to former Local Government Association chairman Sir Simon Milton, who has died after a short illness.

Sir Simon, who was 49, was Deputy Mayor of London for policy and planning as well as serving as Mayor Boris Johnson's chief of staff. He was leader of Westminster City Council for a record eight years from 2000 until his appointment to City Hall in 2008. He was knighted for his services to local government in 2006 and elected chairman of the Local Government Association a year later.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Simon Milton was a dominant and influential voice in the politics of London and local government for the past two decades or more. Minsters in any government would always pay attention when he spoke. A clever and witty man, he brought great charm to his Leadership of Westminster Council, the Chairmanship of the Local Government Association and latterly as Boris' Deputy at City Hall. His persuasive organisational skills will be missed in London government and by his many friends. My thoughts are with his partner Robert.""",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,oral-statement,12-Apr-2011,,,,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

I grew up in West Yorkshire. One of the great things about that part of the world is that you can go from urban to rural in a few steps. For many years some friends of mine lived in Pudsey. Often we would go for Sunday lunch and, afterwards, head off for a walk. We would go deep into the woods to a clearing, bounded by trees - a great natural amphitheatre.  

There, in the eighteenth century, John Wesley used to preach. Working men and women gathered from miles around.  Coming in secret, they travelled for hours and through all weathers to hear the great man speak. As the preacher's voice rang out through that bower, those men and women heard not just of the world to come, but of the world around them - the plight of communities; of poverty and power; of equality and freedom.

Wesley lived through a time of immense change. At his birth in 1703 a person growing up in the countryside had no substantial thought or expectation of change. They would follow in their parents' trade of profession. They would most likely end their life in the village where they began it. By the time Wesley died, in 1791, Britain had gone from being an agrarian nation to the first industrial power. Every generation since has expected change; people would travel; cities would grow at a phenomenal rate from then onwards. And at this time of change, faith was a great strength.

While Europe tore itself apart, Wesley's voice, and the voice of countless other believers, rang out in this country. They inspired their fellow men and women to act with reason and compassion. This tradition continued into the nineteenth century. Think of the great Wilberforce, and his untiring efforts to stop the slave trade; or Elizabeth Fry, valiantly striving for decent treatment of prisoners. They, and the hundreds of thousands of men and women who supported them, transformed Britain. When you remember that Gladstone's first speech in the House of Commons was in defence of the rights of plantation owners, there is no doubt that by the end of the nineteenth century this country was in many senses a more moral place than it was at the start.

A person's faith is what makes that person. It is impossible to divorce faith from moral actions. Wilberforce said:

> ""Is it not the great end of religion…to smooth the asperities of man… to make us compassionate and kind and forgiving…to make us good husbands, good fathers, good friends…?""

This is true not just of Christianity but of all faiths. I was at a meeting of the General Synod a few months back, sitting next to a member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews while the different leaders of Church of England delivered their piece. At one point, Archbishop Sentamu said ""the Christian Church has been doing the Big Society for 2000 years."" The member of the Board of Deputies leant over and whispered ""2000 years? Not a bad start.""

Faith today continues to inspire people to want to do good for their neighbours - whatever their background, and whether they share their faith or have none. I have never in my life come across a church, a synagogue, a temple, a mosque, a gurdwara, a chapel that wholly looked within. That only looked after members of its faith. They are all rooted in - and seeking to do good for - their wider local communities. 

The problem is that, in our recent years, some people have started becoming suspicious about religion. In the eyes of some, the fact that you are a Christian means that you are ""weird."" They ask you to be silent about faith - or not get involved in your community. And if that happens everyone - everyone - loses out from that.

Because we know that you can make a difference. Raising money for social causes. Looking after your neighbourhood.  And reaching people in their darkest hour - when they are suffering with debt, divorce, drugs or despair.

We want to tap into that secular side of your work, into your huge potential to do good. We want to help you fulfil it to the best of your abilities. Not by duplicating. Not by muscling in. But complementing what we find on the ground. And giving you the freedom and encouragement you need.

Now the Great British dilemma is that anyone who wants to get involved immediately has to become an expert. Not in care - but in paperwork. The bureaucracy squeezes out and soaks up the enthusiasm.

The pendulum of health and safety has swung way beyond taking care of people. It has become the bureaucrats' defence:

""If we do our best to stop things happening, nothing can go wrong.""

""And if nothing can go wrong - then we're safe.""

Lord Hodgson's review, _Unshackling Good Neighbours_, made a powerful case that things have to change.

His team heard evidence that a parochial church council organising a fundraising event might have to apply for up to ten different licences.

Even a modest tombola might need official permission.

The Government will be considering the review's recommendations.

But it seems clear to me that it's high time for a return to common sense.

And the tone is very much in keeping with what the Government is already doing to make life easier for charities.

By 2013, charities will be able to make gift aid claims online, saving them time and resources.

They will be able to claim gift aid on up to five thousand pounds of small donations, without having to fill out gift aid forms.

And any groups who are finding it hard to get things done can already get in touch with my Department through our 'barrier busting' website. 

If you're struggling with the unintended consequences of new laws, or over-the-top bureaucracy, my officials can provide support. Because the Big Society means less ""officials telling you what to do"" - and more ""you telling officials how they can help.""

At the same time as we are reducing red tape, we recognise that we are living in very tough financial times.

This Government is dealing with the legacy of the worst recession since the Second World War.

We have taken very difficult decisions to foster growth for the long term.

At every stage, it has been out aim to protect the most vulnerable.

My Department has stretched every sinew to cushion the impact of tight budgets.

Changing the way the grants to local authorities are distributed so that the poorest areas are sheltered most.

And doing as much as we can to safeguard grants to support disabled and elderly people.

We continue to recognise the invaluable work of faith organisations, strengthening the social fabric.

Earlier this year, we awarded £5m to the Church Urban Fund for the 'Near Neighbours' programme.

This programme will provide up to £5,000 for small-scale, grass-roots projects designed to bring people together from different backgrounds: perhaps through sport, art, or community action - maybe clearing up a local park or estate.

I very much look forward to this fund supporting innovative, powerful projects.

But of course, it is not often central Government that you look to as your partner first and foremost in your work with communities.

It is local authorities.

Some local authorities recognise the amazing potential of faith groups - giving them grants, or commissioning them to provide services.

Places such as Chester, Trafford and Stoke-on-Trent have developed a proper, mature relationship. 

In other places, councils are reluctant. They fight shy.

But if faith groups are better placed to reach different communities than just about anyone else, and if they have the networks to influence those who need help most, then councils are missing a trick. 

So we want to change the balance.

Instead of faith groups relying on the good will of local authorities to get involved, we are giving them rights to have a say.

The Localism Bill includes two key measures that place power in the hands of local charities.

The first is the right to buy. 

People will be able to nominate local landmarks and properties that they care about as 'assets of community value'.

When these assets are sold or change hands, local groups will be given extra time to put together a credible bid to take them over.

In other words, we're making it easier for local faith groups to take over buildings: 

Easier for, say, the old meeting hall to become the new premises of a social enterprise.

The second major new right for charity and community groups is the Right to Challenge.

Local groups who have a bright idea for how a service could be run better - whether it's meals on wheels, or homelessness support - will be able to put their proposals in front of the council for proper consideration.

If the proposals are of a decent quality, this will trigger a procurement exercise in line with normal legal requirements. 

And if a faith group puts forward the best proposals, it will have the chance to put its bright ideas into practice. 

These new rights will open the door for faith groups to get further involved in local life. And it's right that they do so.

At the beginning of this new century, or country is home to many different faith communities: Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, Buddhist, Jain and more. 

The fact that we have different faiths makes us stronger. 

They have a legitimate role in commenting on social issues. Making us examine our policies. 

And crucially, faith groups are the heart and soul of local communities.   
They bring huge energy and enthusiasm about improving the opportunities, improving the life chances, and improving the lot of their fellow citizens.

These next few years will be challenging for all communities across our country. We need the contribution of faith groups more than ever. 

So my great hope is that future generations will be able to look back and see today as the point when the British became comfortable with social action inspired by faith. And I have no doubt that, come what may, you will all continue to heed Wesley's words - to:

By all the means you can.  
In all the ways you can.  
In all the places you can.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2097824,Fire and rescue control services,"* * *

Today the Government is publishing the outcome of its invitation to fire and rescue authorities in England to submit their plans to improve the resilience, efficiency and technology in their control services following the termination of the last Government's FiReControl project in December 2010.

In contrast to the last administration, the Coalition Government is adopting a localist approach to help secure improvements in national resilience, rather than the flawed approach of FireControl which tried to impose a top-down regionalisation of the fire service.

As I announced in my statement of 13 December 2011, Official Report, Column 90WS, the Government is making available £81 million for local improvements - up to £1.8 million for each authority - and additional funding of £1.8 million to secure benefits of national importance bringing total funding available to £82.8 million.

I would like to thank all the fire and rescue authorities that responded to this invitation and for their co-operation in sharing their plans. Most respondents agreed with the Government's preferred approach of achieving this through improvements and increased collaboration - in a locally-determined manner, with some Government support. The plans submitted by fire and rescue authorities have reinforced this approach and shown how a localist approach will build resilience on a national scale.

Our approach also seeks to take steps to tackle the legacy of the empty Regional Fire Control buildings which we have inherited, and which as the National Audit Office has observed, were a consequence of the flawed procurement process of the FiReControl programme. Some of these bids will make use of these legacy buildings; otherwise, we are separately seeking to dispose of the buildings for appropriate public or private sector use, to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.

This Government has also acknowledged the criticism of the National Audit Office of the FiReControl programme. As it stated in its report of 1 July 2011, HC 1272:

> ""The FiReControl project was flawed from the outset because it did not have the support of those essential to its success-local Fire and Rescue Services. The Department rushed the start of the project, failing to follow proper procedures. Ineffective checks and balances during initiation and early stages meant the Department committed itself to the project on the basis of broad-brush and inaccurate estimates of costs and benefits and an unrealistic delivery timetable, and agreed an inadequate contract with its IT supplier. The Department under-appreciated the project's complexity, and then mismanaged the IT contractor's performance and delivery. The Department failed to provide the necessary leadership to make the project successful, over-relying on poorly managed consultants and failing to sort out early problems with delivery by the contractor. The Department took a firmer grip of the project from 2009 and terminated the contract in December 2010 to avoid even more money being wasted."" (National Audit Office press release, The Failure of the FiReControl project, 1 July 2011).

In total, 23 bids were received from 44 of the 46 fire and rescue authorities. The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority did not submit a bid as alternative arrangements had been agreed previously and resulted in London's fire control arrangements being provided from a new Operations Centre in Merton, which I had the pleasure of opening on 1 February. The Isles of Scilly Fire and Rescue Authority did not bid because its control arrangements are already provided by Cornwall Fire and Rescue Authority.

The bids outline a series of local proposals to:

  * Improve the efficiency of fire and rescue control rooms; for example, Staffordshire and West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authorities aim to combine the provision of control room services for both authorities sharing one common call handling and mobilising, command and control system, including a secondary control providing local resilience. Combining control services will provide the opportunity to improve efficiency.

  * Strengthen local resilience; for example, resilience for large incidents and spate conditions in Buckinghamshire, Cambridge and Suffolk will be enhanced due to greater numbers of control staff being on duty at any one time than had they worked in isolation and create a larger pool to 'recall to duty' if required, thereby strengthening the building blocks of national resilience.

  * Improve the ability to interoperate with each other and with other emergency services and agencies; 36 fire and rescue authorities' submitted joint bids that involved collaboration with at least one other fire and rescue authority. The other 8 fire and rescue authorities' submitted bids that involved collaboration with other emergency or local services.

  * Deliver cumulative financial savings of over £120 million by 2021; and

  * Provide a platform for further strengthening and improvement.

Each bid has been considered carefully in line with the criteria I set out in July for value for money, efficiency and resilience. The resilience aspects of each bid were assessed by the Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser. I am pleased to be able to announce that I will be providing funding this year to the following fire and rescue authorities:

  * Buckinghamshire
  * Cambridgeshire and Suffolk
  * Cornwall
  * Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire
  * Devon & Somerset, Dorset, Hampshire and Wiltshire
  * Essex and Bedfordshire & Luton
  * Gloucestershire
  * Hereford & Worcester and Shropshire & Wrekin
  * Hertfordshire, Humberside, Lincolnshire and Norfolk
  * Kent
  * Isle of Wight and Surrey
  * Merseyside
  * Northamptonshire and Warwickshire
  * Oxfordshire and Berkshire
  * South and West Yorkshire
  * Staffordshire and West Midlands
  * Tyne & Wear and Northumberland.

I rejected 13 requests for funding above the indicative amount of £1.8 million per fire and rescue authority. In those cases, I am awarding £1.8 million per fire and rescue authority. The submissions did not provide evidence of exceptional factors sufficient to justify a higher amount.

These allocations are in addition to early bids that I had already accepted from: a consortia of four fire and rescue authorities (for Lancashire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Cumbria); Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Authority; and East and West Sussex Fire and Rescue Authorities. I awarded the consortia of four authorities an additional £300,000 per authority above the indicative amount because their plans involve utilising the new Control Centre in Warrington and will deliver additional savings to the public.  
   
There are three bids from English fire and rescue authorities which require further work before I can award any funding. I have asked officials to work with Avon Fire and Rescue Authority, Cleveland Fire and Rescue Authority and North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Authority with the aim of concluding matters by the end of June. I have set aside funding for them. We received one bid from a Welsh Joint Emergency Services Group which was out scope for the funding and has therefore been rejected.

I am also announcing today that I am minded to provide some funding from the £1.8 million fund for interoperability to a collaborative partnership of 13 fire and rescue authorities which has submitted a bid to develop standard operating procedures. I have asked officials to work with the authorities concerned to significantly reduce costs and ensure proposals align and support wider work now underway on cross 'blue light' service interoperability and have potential to be adopted across all fire and rescue authorities. We will be reviewing the further work underway on cross-service interoperability and will consider whether there is other essential work that ought to be funded from the £1.8 million interoperability fund.

My Department is writing today to fire and rescue authorities to notify them of the outcome of their bids. Where bids have not been accepted this communication will set out the next steps.  
  
I am pleased to note that the Chief Fire Officers Association National Resilience has developed a detailed peer support process designed to provide assistance and support to fire authorities with the implementation of their control room improvement plans. This will provide central support to single fire authorities, or groups of partnering authorities, to facilitate implementation of their proposals to improve or replace their fire control facilities. It will also include the provision of a sector owned central repository to collate and manage information that will aid all fire authorities with the improvement or replacement of existing fire control facilities, along with the provision of professional support and assistance to resolve problems or issues when required or requested to do so.

Today the Government is publishing a consultation on the future of fire and rescue control services in England. This follows the closure of the FiReControl project, announced in my statement to the House of 20 December 2010 [col 141WS].

Local fire and rescue authorities have a statutory duty to answer emergency calls and mobilise resources. They have continued to fulfil this duty, and be funded to do so, during the lifetime of the project and, consequently, the closure of the project poses no risk to public safety.

This Government believes that the fire and rescue community is best placed to decide the future of their control services. No solution will be imposed. The consultation reviews the legacy assets from the project, as well as lessons learnt, and encourages the sector to make best use of these in their future plans, for the benefit of both the taxpayer and local communities.

The consultation discusses whether the original aims of the project - improving efficiency, national resilience and the technology available to fire and rescue services - are still valid and, if so, how they might be achieved now. It also considers the principles on which available funding should be distributed. The role of central government, if any, is also considered.

A copy of the consultation document is available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Responses are requested by 8 April 2011.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,,written-statement,13-Jan-2011,,,supporting-fire-and-rescue-authorities-to-reduce-the-number-and-impact-of-fires,,,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

#### Introduction

Thank you for inviting me here today to give the key note address at your Annual Conference and to have the opportunity to meet with a vital group within the fire sector - the suppliers. I have the honour of speaking to you at this relatively new headquarters belonging to the Fire Industry Association. I know that I can rely on this building to have excellent fire detection systems in place though let's not put them to the test today.

All of you here today are very important contributors to what has been achieved in the fire and rescue service to date. I hope you will continue to be involved in taking forward new ideas and ways of working to ensure future successes.

I appreciate that this will not be an easy task since we are all facing tough choices around funding and prioritising resources.

It will be especially difficult for suppliers in a market where some purchasers may be tightening their budget in the next few years. It is essential that we try to maintain choice and innovation and that we continue to support small and medium sized enterprises where possible. This aim can only be achieved by working in partnership with the rest of the fire sector.

My theme for today is working through change. The challenges you face may be different depending on the size of your organisation and the products that you supply, from splinter shields through to the bigger fire appliances that are instantly recognizable to the public. However all of you here today will experience change if you have not already done so. How we work together going forward will help determine how we respond to such changes.

#### Firebuy

At my meeting with FIRESA officials on the 14 February 2011, Dave Russell and Gerry Styler gave the clear message on your behalf that there was a need for continuity and confidence going forward following the announcement on the closure of Firebuy.

This closure was [announced](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/public-body-review-published) (external link) on 14 October 2010 as part of the wider review of Arms Length Bodies across Government. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that this decision was _not_ a reflection on the work that Firebuy had done or the services it has offered. I would like to pay tribute to Firebuy who have been a professional and dedicated resource for national procurement, and have secured efficiency savings and framework contracts that are used not just by the fire and rescue service but also by organisations outside the sector.

However, this is not the type of function that needs to be undertaken by central Government. This does not mean going back to 46 Fire and Rescue Authorities buying their own bespoke equipment and requiring suppliers to undertake the tender process every single time. Those days are long gone since the need to prioritise funding and resources will encourage collaborative procurements which serve the operational needs of the service.

In closing Firebuy the key issue was for us to ensure a seamless and open transition to the new arrangements. We were keen to keep suppliers up to date on developments through FIRESA which we have done. From 14 October we put in place an intensive bidding process to take on the framework contracts that are the main part of Firebuy's business. I know Gerry Styler attended the initial framework information open day on 15 October on behalf of FIRESA.

Several organisations expressed an interest in taking on these frameworks demonstrating that they were highly valued by the fire sector and beyond. Following a detailed competitive process The Consortium for Purchasing and Distribution Limited was selected as the preferred bidder subject to the due diligence process which is still ongoing. I know you have already head from Melanie Teal, the Chief Executive of The Consortium, who I was delighted to meet today.

I am aware that the actual contract novation process may be a logistical headache for many of you. We will help you through this process starting with an information session this afternoon where legal and procurement experts will be available to take questions and give you practical advice.

The aim is for Firebuy to cease business by the end of April. However we want to ensure that the novation is done correctly and if the process takes a little longer than this then we will continue to keep everyone informed.

Since the announcement of Firebuy's closure we have encouraged purchasers to continue using the frameworks to allow for business continuity and to maintain the benefits of collaborative procurement. We want as seamless a transition to the new arrangements as possible.

The other functions that Firebuy undertake such as the management of the New Dimension contract will come into my Department from April 2011 pending further consideration of longer term arrangements with the Sector. The management of the Integrated Clothing Project, Technical Services and Enprotex will also transfer to DCLG from April 2011.

I know three of the Firebuy staff are here today, Terry Brewer, Graham Maltby and Elaine Hughes. I would like to express my personal appreciation to all the Firebuy team for their hard work and commitment in working towards the orderly closure of the organisation, and transfer of functions. I think we all recognise that this has not been an easy time for them. They continue to put their customers and suppliers first and show the professionalism that has been present since they began in 2006.

#### FiReControl

On 20 December 2010 I [announced](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1803629) the closure of the FiReControl project. The consultation on the future of fire and rescue control services was issued on 13 January and closes on 8 April 2011. I hope you will all take the opportunity to feed into this.

#### Supplier issues

There is an economic challenge ahead for all involved since we have to reduce the unprecedented public sector deficit. The Fire and Rescue Service has been given some protection in the recent Spending Review settlement, though to achieve the savings required there will be a need to increase efficiency and deliver reform.

Let's not pretend that suppliers will not be impacted by the economic situation, but fire and rescue equipment will continue to be required and there may be new markets for your equipment and expertise. Challenging times of change provide us with the impetus to seek out new opportunities and be innovative in the way that we work.

At the recent meeting I had with Dave and Gerry they highlighted the need for suppliers to continue to develop International and European connections. Howard Gibbs from UKTI has spoken to you this morning and I hope has given you some useful tips and understanding.

My own Department is occasionally involved in meeting international delegations. Sir Ken Knight, the Chief Fire and Rescue Advisor, is instrumental in developing these relationships with the wider fire and rescue sector. We would be happy to consider any opportunities where the Department can offer support in exporting your products and expertise.

I understand that some of you have had concerns over tendering practices in some member states and that there is a level playing field for all concerned. I am not aware of any uncompetitive practices but if there is concrete evidence of this occurring then let us know.

#### Wider vision for Government

We are working with the fire sector to free them from unnecessary bureaucracy where possible, to build on their work in the community, and to create a new and stronger relationship of influence and accountability with citizens. As part of this I would like to touch on the Government's wider regulatory policy.

In these difficult times, an important part of the Government's strategy for financial growth is to support business by adopting a deregulatory policy. Regulation is therefore a last resort. This Government will not add to the regulatory burden unless it can be demonstrated to be the only option for delivering our policy objectives.

Even in these limited circumstances, the introduction of the 'one-in-one-out' rule means that before any new regulation is introduced, the costs must be fully justified through an impact assessment and an existing regulatory burden must be identified and removed so that the overall amount of regulation does not increase.

Rebuilding responsibility and giving people more control over their lives is the key message at the heart of the Big Society and the Localism Bill. These messages are relevant to you as suppliers as they are about transferring power away from Whitehall to people and communities creating the conditions which will allow individuals, communities and businesses the power to build successful neighbourhoods. I invite you to be part of this opportunity to influence decisions going forward.

Government will soon publish a White Paper setting out our approach to public service reform, putting in place principles that will signal the end of the top-down, overly bureaucratic model of public services and allow users to determine what is needed to deliver growth and success in their own community.

#### Fire Futures

This is all part of resetting the traditional relationships between central government, local government, communities and individuals. As part of this new way of working some of you have been involved in the [Fire Futures](http://www.communities.gov.uk/fire/firerescueservice/firefutures/) initiative.

This encouraged all those involved in the fire sector to review and challenge existing structures and policies, to consider what will be needed in the future and to suggest ways that we can get to there. I have been very impressed by the energy and commitment of the entire sector in rising to this challenge and driving it forward. I thank the efforts of all contributors including Dave Russell. This has taken time and commitment but it ensured that suppliers had a say in what was happening. I hope you enjoyed the experience and will continue to be involved.

We will be formally responding to the Fire Future reports shortly but as part of this, as I have said, we need to reset the relationship - what is already clear is that we in Government want to enable change and decentralisation; we don't intend to impose or manage new ways of working from the centre.

My expectation is therefore that the majority of the ideas coming through Fire Futures are for the wider sector to take forward as it sees fit. The Fire Community Forum is an example of industry taking on board the key messages around decentralisation and getting on with it. This forum will consider knowledge management, the built environment and workforce development.

Fire Futures has shown that different bodies within the fire sector can work together towards a common aim. Let's build on this collaborative work to help deliver the changes that are needed.

#### Conclusion

Thank you for inviting me here today to talk with you. I hope what I have said has helped give you a clearer understanding of all the work that is going on to give power back to communities, and to ensure that future decisions can be made by the people that they directly affect. It will be a challenge but you have already started this process and by working together in new ways I am confident that all of us in the fire sector can deliver this change.

I will be able to take a few questions at the end. If there is insufficient time to answer them today or if you think of issues subsequently then please let the FIRESA team or my officials know and we will get back to you.

Finally Dave and Gerry will be stepping down from their roles in 2012 and in the meantime they are working hard to handover to the new team during the next year. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the hard work and dedication that they have put in since they were appointed and would ask you all to show your appreciation for representing you so ably during a period of intense activity.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/fireservicecollegefuture,Fire Service College: future,"* * *

The Government sees strong value in a national College for the Fire and Rescue Service to deliver common, consistent standards of safety critical training and improved intra-operability across the Service in support of resilience and to enable it to meet public expectations.

However, the current Fire Service College ownership and business arrangements do not provide the flexibility necessary for the College to operate with sufficient commercial success. As we said in our response to _Fire Futures_, the Government wishes to explore options for a new ownership, operational and governance model for the Fire Service College which, through greater involvement from other sectors (whether private, public or voluntary), secures its future, supports national resilience and provides best value for the public purse.

The Government's preferred option for a Fire Service College of the future is a partnership between the public and private sectors with the fire sector playing a key role in that partnership. Whilst a public/private sector partnership is the preferred option, we do not wish to close off other options and would welcome ideas on whether other arrangements may be more suitable.

To inform its view of market appetite and viable options, the Department for Communities and Local Government is today launching a short phase of pre-market engagement. This will allow interested parties to offer clear views on the future of the College, and the Department to assess the reaction of the market to the overarching aim of delivering a new model for the Fire Service College.

Following constructive discussions with the firefighters' trades unions, on 8 December I wrote to all of the firefighters' trades unions to issue the cost ceiling for the Firefighters' Pension Scheme. This included a generous accrual rate, and provided protection for all those within ten years of their current scheme's Normal Pension Age from any change in when they can retire, nor any decrease in the pension they receive at their current Normal Pension Age.

The Government pays tribute to the importance of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the bravery, dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work within it. The Government is committed to providing public service pensions that are sustainable, fair and effective.

Building on the proposals brought forward by Lord Hutton, these proposals aim to strike a balanced deal between public service workers and the taxpayer. They will ensure that public service workers continue to have access to good pensions, while taxpayers benefit from greater control over their costs.

Public sector pensions will remain among the very best available - a guaranteed level and inflation proofed. Only 1 in 10 private sector workers have access to such schemes.

I am pleased to report that the Heads of Agreement for the design of a new pension scheme for firefighters' in England has now been established. Each trades union with firefighter members will now consider the main design elements of a new scheme to be available for their members from 2015. Further work will take place over the coming weeks to establish the final details and Executives can consult members as appropriate.

I am particularly grateful for the manner in which firefighters' trades unions have maintained a constructive dialogue over the emerging detailed elements of the new Scheme. Further discussion will now take place through the Scheme's Pension Reform Group.

There will be full protection for the accrued rights of existing scheme members:

  * all benefits accrued under final salary arrangements will be linked to the members' final salary, in accordance with the rules of the members' current schemes, when they leave the reformed scheme
  * full recognition of a members' expectation to double accrual for service accrued under the Firefighters' Pension Scheme 1992 ('the 1992 scheme'), so that a members' full continuous pensionable service upon retirement will be used to calculate an averaged accrual rate to be applied to service accrued under the 1992 scheme
  * members to be able to access their 1992 scheme benefits when they retire at that scheme's ordinary pension age (i.e. from age 50 with 25 or more years pensionable service), subject to abatement rules for that scheme. Pensionable service for the purpose of calculating the ordinary pension age will include any continuous pensionable service accrued under both the 1992 scheme and the 2015 scheme
  * members will continue to have access to an actuarially assessed commutation factor for benefits accrued under the 1992 scheme

There also will be transitional protections for qualifying, existing members:

  * all active scheme members who, as of 1 April 2012, have 10 years or less to their current Normal Pension Age will see no change in when they can retire, nor any decrease in the amount of pension they receive at their current Normal Pension Age. This protection will be achieved by the member remaining in their current scheme until they retire.
  * there will be a further 4 years of tapered protection for scheme members. Members who are up to 14 years from their current Normal Pension Age, as of 1 April 2012, will have limited protection so that on average for every month of age they are beyond 10 years of their Normal Pension Age, they gain about 53 days of protection. The last day of protected service for any member will be 31 March 2022.

The main parameters of the new scheme are set out below:

> a. a pension scheme design based on career average revalued earnings
> 
> b. a provisional accrual rate of 1/58.7th of pensionable earnings each year, subject to further agreement on the outstanding issues
> 
> c. there will be no cap on how much pension can be accrued
> 
> d. a revaluation rate of active members' benefits in line with average weekly earnings
> 
> e. pensions in payment and deferred benefits to increase in line with Prices Index (currently Consumer Prices Index)
> 
> f. average member contributions of 13.2 per cent from April 2015, with some protection for new entrants. However, the Government will review the impact of the proposed 2012-13 contribution changes, including the effect of membership opt-outs, before taking final decisions on how future increases will be delivered in 2013-14 and 2014-15, and in the new scheme.
> 
> g. flexible retirement from the scheme's minimum pension age of 55, built around the scheme's normal pension age of 60, with members able to take their pension from minimum pension age as follows:
>
>> - for all active members who are aged 57 or more at retirement, 2015 scheme benefits taken before Normal Pension Age will be actuarially reduced with reference to the 2015 scheme's Normal Pension Age, rather than the deferred pension age
>> 
>> - all other members will have their 2015 scheme benefits actuarially reduced on a cost neutral basis from the scheme's deferred pension age
> 
> h. the Normal Pension Age will be subject to regular review. These reviews will consider the increasing State Pension Age and any changes to it, alongside evidence from interested parties, including unions and employers. It will consider if the Normal Pension Age of 60 remains relevant, taking account of the economical, efficient and effective management of the fire service, the changing profile of the workforce and the occupational demands of, and fitness standards for, firefighting roles
> 
> i. this regular review will be informed by such research carried out by the Firefighters' Pension Committee, which will monitor and collate scheme data and experience
> 
> j. late retirement factors for members retiring from active service to be actuarially neutral from Normal Pension Age
> 
> k. a deferred pension age equal to the individuals' State Pension Age
> 
> l. optional lump sum by commutation at a rate of £12 for every £1 per annum of pension foregone in accordance with HMRC limits and regulations
> 
> m. abatement in existing schemes to continue
> 
> n. ill-health retirement and all other ancillary benefits to be based on the arrangements in the 2006 scheme
> 
> o. an employer contribution cap and floor to provide backstop protection to the taxpayer against unforeseen costs and risks.

The Government Actuary's Department has confirmed that this scheme design does not exceed the cost ceiling set by the Government. Copies of the Heads of Agreement and the Government Actuary's Department verification report have been placed in the Library.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/flaginstitutespring2011,Flag Institute spring meeting 2011,"* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Let me start by congratulating the Flag Institute on its first 40 years. 40 years as a respected source of help and advice. Not only to the UK Government, but to the United Nations and other organisations around the world. 40 years of bringing together enthusiasts, educating the public, and spreading knowledge.

I wouldn't, of course, claim to have anything like the expertise of your members. But it's no secret that I share something of your enthusiasm.

Flags deserve respect:

  * they can exercise great power
  * rallying people behind a cause
  * inspiring pride

The power of flags to move people is written deep in our culture - everywhere from the _Old Testament_ to Shakespeare.

And they matter as much as ever today. They give people a way of saying ""we belong."" Whether it's to their nation, or their county.

A flag is an object of pure joy. At the Royal Wedding, we saw flags in abundance. Flags representing the home countries of visitors from across the world. And our own flags. The Union Flag. The St George's Cross. The Welsh dragon. The Saltire.

The display of our flags is a symbol of our shared union. Celebrating what makes the places we love distinct, and special, and unique. We shouldn't be afraid of that sense of pride. We should join in the celebration.

Of course, not everyone agrees. Look at St George's Day. Each year there are a small number of spoilsports in councils, and other public institutions, who don't want to fly the St George's Cross.

> They say it's health and safety: you'll have someone's eye out...
> 
> They say it's cultural awareness and equality rules: someone, somewhere might be offended…

Well I'm not convinced by either of those explanations.

The real reason some are nervous is because some extreme groups have tried to wrap themselves up in the flag. Well I don't think the answer is to wring our hands. To say: ""take it away."" The answer is to say ""that is ours. We'll have it back, please.""

It would be disgraceful to leave the flag in the hands of people who want to put us asunder. When the fact is - our and local and national, flags unite people of every creed, class and colour. Community cohesion is strengthened - not undermined - by flying the flag.

That's why in my Department we've stood up for common sense. We've made clear that at moments of national pride and celebration - the Royal Wedding, St George's Day and the World Cup - people should feel free to celebrate by flying the flag. And public institutions should support them.

As well as being national symbols, flags can be a powerful way of celebrating local pride and identity. At my Department - we've made a point of flying the county flags of England. A different one every week. We've celebrated the astonishing variety of different English counties. From the bars of Northumberland, to the St Piran's cross of Cornwall. And next week, we'll be flying the flag of Middlesex.

Middlesex may be an historic county - and not a current unit of local government administration. But it retains its place in people's memories and affections, despite attempts to wipe it off the map. That is hardly surprising, when the historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete those longstanding and cherished local identities.

Neither Middlesex, nor the Ridings of Yorkshire - nor people's sense of belonging to them - can be abolished by the stroke of a bureaucrat's pen. In fact, we're seeing interest in county flags grow. As you may know, Nottinghamshire held a poll last month on adopting a new county flag. That's a symbol of the enduring strength of county's identity.

Compare that with the so-called 'government regions'. Supported by a complex and costly apparatus of regional bodies - Regional Development Agencies, Regional Assemblies, and Government Offices for the Regions. Unelected. Unaccountable. And striking very little chord with the people they were supposed to serve.

When asked, the case for regional government was overwhelmingly rejected by the people in the 2004 referendum on a North East assembly. Because people identify with their nation, town, city and county.

That's why it is so worrying that, as part of its INTERREG programme, the European Union has invented 'transnational regions'. One of these is the 'Arc Manche', designed to strengthen links between counties on the South coast of England and Departements in the North coast of France. A project on which millions of taxpayers' money has been spent. This Government will be making very clear its opposition to the invention and promotion of artificial regions at public expense, be they European or home-grown.

It's because they are powerful that flags deserve respect. And it's right that we have rules setting out how and when different flags can be used. But today, I think it's time to look again at some of those rules.

As you will know, there are a number of flags that can be flown without having to ask for express advertisement consent. These include national flags, county flags and the Commonwealth flag. To fly other flags, you have to apply for consent. This costs up to £335 a time.

But surely there are times when it might be appropriate to let people fly other flags, without requiring them to make an application.

> …what about the Armed Forces Day flag?
> 
> …what about the school who want to celebrate the local regiment?
> 
> …what about the Australian pub who want to fly the Queensland flag in solidarity with people affected by floods?
> 
> …and what about the university who want to honour their foreign exchange guests by flying the flag of, say, Prague?

I intend to start a consultation, later this year, about whether - and how - we should extend the group of flags that can be flown without requiring consent. Making it easier for people to celebrate an identity or an organisation that means something to them.

There will be some important questions to think about. About how, exactly, we might extend the rules. About what it might mean for the councils who enforce them. And we would, of course, make sure that people would not be able to fly flags without the owners' permission.

That's why we will need a full debate. And I hope the Institute - with your wealth of expertise - will be able not just to play a full part in that debate, but to help us make sure we asking the right questions in the first place.

I began by saying that flags deserve respect.

The UK is very lucky in having - in the Institute - a group of dedicated and informed people who do a great deal to make sure that that respect is given.

In your first 40 years you have established your credentials not just in this country, but on the world stage. Over the next 40, there can be no doubt that you will continue to go from strength to strength.

I wish you every success, and look forward to the chance of continuing to talk with you over the months to come.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"The Naval Club, London",,,,14-May-2011,,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I was reading my local paper, the _Brentwood Gazette_, recently and I came across some volunteering exploits:

  * a bunch of lads who fixed up a vandalised garden for people with disabilities.
  * a man who gives up his time to coach amateur boxers
  * friends who planted a community garden for all to enjoy

Lovely stuff.

But it was Terry Monaghan's story that really caught my eye.

For years he's helped hundreds of local folk by organising volunteer drivers to and from hospital appointments across Essex.

On being awarded an MBE, he said:

> ""it was the biggest surprise of his life"".

He couldn't fathom why.

He had a heartfelt belief that a strong community was a part of society and not something exceptional.

It's the same story up and down the country. Volunteering is at the heart of good communities.

It's not the big flashy stuff that makes the national news.

As Terry suggested, that's not why people get involved.

They don't volunteer for headlines or for awards. They volunteer to give something back.

This is why the sector matters so much.

It is localism in action.

You are best placed to build communities, to get involved, and to improve the neighbourhoods you live in.

And that is why we're pushing power your way, so more people can get involved, so more people can take charge.

### Protection and progress

Yes times are tough. You'll have your own war stories to tell.

No-one is pretending the past twelve months have been easy, but nor can we pretend it can get instantly better.

That is why we're here today to talk about the future.

We can't spend without consequence. We can't pile more debt on the national credit card without even bigger consequences.

It is a fact we have to face up to. There is less money today.

So instead of focussing on what you're not getting, I urge you to focus on what you have and what you can still achieve.

The voluntary sector is built on more than money; it has ideas, passion, commitment, determination and values that make a real impact.

We want communities to thrive. We know volunteer's make places better.

Over the last year we have done a lot to help you take strides forward, innovate and get on with what you do best.

You are not an 'easy target'.

The Best Value Guidance and duty is there to prevent that.

We'll stand up for you where councils unfairly reduce support.

I've shown I'm ready to have 'polite words' with councils to remind them the drawbridge stays firmly down.

No need to name names. Particularly since councils concerned have mended their ways.

By now councils know they must work more efficiently to maintain services and places that local people need and want to live in.

It's this commitment that will drive them into partnership with voluntary groups.

Merton has seen your value and protected budgets and grants. They recognise it's a good investment.

Derby, Sefton, Bradford and Sheffield applied the guidance and had grown up conversations with the sector about services and budget realities before taking decisions.

As Nick Hurd touched on earlier, our commitment is not just words.

Six and a half billion is there to help with housing support for vulnerable groups.

Thirty million pounds is there to help modernise organisations that support charities.

Another thirty million is there to tackle homelessness with the sector's help.

Ten million is there to train up the sector to win more contracts.

And money is there for the Big Society and vulnerable charities.

### Tackling the red tape

We've raised the bar for commissioning services, improving tenders and procurement opportunities.

Councils must reach that bar too if they are to support communities better.

That means offering more work to the voluntary sector.

We're tackling red-tape. I know gold plating is a worry.

Too often it prevents you getting in bids. And too many councils are guilty of sticking religiously to EU rules at the expense of voluntary groups.

We're backing Contract Finder that helps match up providers and bidders. And calling on all councils to make regular use of the service.

We're shelving that bureaucratic form - the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire - for work under one hundred thousand pounds.

I know Sir Merrick at the Local Government Association is keen to for councils to take the same tack and I am confident progress is being made.

Too often you have faced an uphill struggle, held back by so called 'health and safety' regulations.

Too often good community gestures to improve the neighbourhood have been curbed.

In Surrey, for example, a couple intent on cleaning up litter on their road were met - not with a handshake of thanks - but with the grasp of the cold dead hand of municipal bureaucracy on their broom handles.

The County Council, warped and convoluted by its own 'official procedure', were demanding an £80 licence fee from these two kind folk for trying to do something it was meant to have done in the first place.

We need to unshackle good neighbours like these.

In this, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year, when communities want to come together, gather in the streets, put up bunting and celebrate all that's good about their neighbourhood we're saying go ahead, enjoy the day.

No more form filling madness. No more liability limitations.

We are removing the restraints.

… And no more closed books either. The bright light of transparency is transforming the way communities can see how their hard earned cash is being spent.

You can use that information to compete for business.

We are determined that you should not be held back an inch, not by councils, not by Government.

### Opportunities - Challenge to the sector

Sir Stephen Bubb has said to you:

> ""rather than waiting for your boat to come in, swim out and get it"".

And Sir Stuart Etherington has spoken  about his love of Dickens, but his lack of empathy for the character Mr Micawber: The man who waited forever for things to turn up. I agree.

Now isn't the time to wait till things fall into your lap. It's time to put your talents to work … use your skills and creativity to charge ahead.

It's a time to be more like David Copperfield.

The teller of his own tale, the maker of his own success, he was determined to be the 'hero of his own life'.

We've opened up opportunities; it's up to you to make something out of them.

The shift in power is a shift locally. You now need to make the difference for your communities.

Get out there and work with councils.

Where you don't have a relationship, build one.

Where you don't have friends, make them.

Where you have bonds, cement them.

You might not be driven by profit or the bottom line.

But be driven by the need to deliver, to return that investment for the community.

To answer to your shareholders, the people.

To challenge councils to work with you.

To make neighbourhoods the places people want to live.

It's is something you've got to be willing to take on.

The Localism Act is giving you that revolutionary opportunity.

You now have a 'Community Right to Challenge' - a way to takeover local services.

You now have a 'Community Right to Bid' - a way to save local assets like leisure centres, playing fields or libraries.

You now have a right - through neighbourhood planning - to influence the feel and future of the places we call home.

Up and down the country people are already getting involved, bringing new ideas to the table.

In Cold Norton, villagers banded together to run their local pub, making it more than a place to grab a pint, a community hub with classes for senior citizens and activities for kids.

In Leeds volunteers took over a two million pound community drug treatment centre.

### Conclusion

The future is no longer fixed by solutions of the past. It will be built on your ambitions and actions.

We are opening up public services, but it is up to you to lead the revolution.

Use your expertise, your creativity and your determination - it is in this room today - work for local people.

The new rights are at your disposal.

Transparency will show you the opportunities.

Work with councils. Prove your value.

It's about the people and the communities.

It's about making neighbourhoods the places people want to bring up kids

… the places where folks know they have got support even in tough times

… the places they are proud to call home.

Go into your community, make friends and influence people and places locally.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Central Hall Westminster, London",,,,14-Mar-2012,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

### Transcript

Let me start by saying the obvious: it was a tough settlement. I know councils are facing very difficult choices.

But so is the nation.

Public debt is now approaching nearly a trillion pounds.

Last year, the Government was borrowing one pound in every four it spent.

It spent more on interest payments on public debt than on schools.

It was completely unsustainable. It risked our economic credibility and our economic future.

You can't ignore a quarter of public spending, and councils recognise that they have an important role to play in bringing down public sector debt.

But given the track record that local authorities have - more prudent, more efficient than other parts of the public sector over the past few years - I have every confidence that local authorities will rise to the challenge.

Against that background it is not easy to increase productivity and reduce back office services - without hitting front line services.

Leicestershire and Nottingham, planning to save £2 million a year through sharing their back offices.

West London councils looking to go even further and share front line services.

Bath cutting their top team - so the money can go to the frontline.

Leighton Buzzard saving money thanks to good housekeeping over the past few years - which they can now invest in actually improving some services.

I'm really pleased about the numbers of councils who are coming together to share services and work through these challenges together.

I'm really impressed with the numbers who are biting the bullet on senior pay and sharing chief executives.

And I'm grateful to those who are recognising the importance of transparency - I'm pleased to report that more than 200 councils have now put their spending online.

Now of course, there are some councils who have been out grandstanding in the media.

But if you'll forgive me, I'm not going to address them today.

Because they aren't listening.

I am much more interested in working with the majority of you who have stepped up to the plate.

I want to make sure you have everything you need to tackle these challenges head on.

The Localism Bill will make a very big difference.

And I want to thank the NLGN who have worked so constructively with us to shape the best possible deal.

You helped organise a meeting that framed my idea of the operation of the general power of competence - and I hope you will work with us again as we start looking at the repatriation of business rates.

For the first time in decades, councils will have real bite, real powers, a real say over the issues that matter to residents.

All part of a much more radical distribution of power - so community groups and residents have much greater control over their lives.

This is an incredible opportunity for those ambitious, radical councils with a powerful vision for their area. 

But there is also a big threat to localism on the horizon.

An issue which fills middle England with rage.

Cuts to bin collections.

If councils can deliver a service that the public like and have confidence in, that's a matter for them.

But, we need to remember that rubbish is the most visible, most frontline service of all, in return for paying £120 a month in council tax.

If we don't sort this out, we will set the cause of localism back by a generation, by creating an army of residents who view their council with resentment rather than respect.

There is genuine anger that in the past decade their council tax bills have doubled, but their bin collections have halved.

In the public's experience, the iron fist of the municipal state has come down on people for the most minor of bin breaches.

State officials - a town hall bin police - rifle through families' bins without their consent.

Good Samaritans who pick up a fly-tip are admonished for dropping it off at the local dump.

And pensioners face larger fines than shoplifters for the offence of not closing a bin lid.

I could not think of anything more corrosive to destroy trust in local councils than a stealthy imposition of bin cuts, bin fines and bin taxes.

It is naive to think this has been purely a consequence of local discretion. It most certainly has not. All of these bin policies came from central government interventions and interference.

Cooked up in Whitehall, with councils picking up the blame.

With almost no debate in Parliament, the law was changed, weakening the requirement to collect bins, and allowing bin charging.

The Audit Commission marked down councils which refused to go fortnightly, and issued guidance cajoling councils to restrict their service to households, while quangos urged councils to impose fortnightly collections - recommending doing so after local elections to avoid it being a 'political issue' and - quote - to overcome 'public resistance'.

These central policies resulted in perverse local outcomes which need to change.

So we've already taken steps to abolish bin taxes.

We are scrapping the Audit Commission's interfering inspections.

We've issued new guidance to stop bin snooping.

And the Government's Waste Review will set out a proper route map.

We intend to work with councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections - starting with removing the perverse incentives that have pushed councils to cut services.

We want to make it easier to go green - championing innovative schemes like Recyclebank which reward recycling.

And we will tackle public concerns over the civil liberty aspects of inappropriate enforcement practices; while clamping down on genuine fly-tipping which blights our lay-bys, our side streets and our countryside.

The local government sector must wake up to the fact that - even with the best of intentions - public policy on bin collections went horribly wrong in recent years.

But if we need to address the issues which threaten localism - we also need to look at those forces which will really give it bite.

In particular, I want to make sure that councils have economic freedom to go with their political independence.

We've taken some steps in the right direction.

With a couple of exceptions we've ended ringfencing so that councils get their money with no strings attached.

We will also be letting them borrow against future growth in business rates.

But we need more fundamental reform.

So the system is more transparent - not a formula Einstein himself would struggle to understand.

And so we break councils' financial dependency on central government. Having to come round with the begging bowl, saying 'please sir, I want some more' isn't the mature relationship we need.

The key is letting councils keep much more of their business rates.

In one fell swoop, you make the system more straightforward.

Make councils more self-sufficient.

Give them a genuine financial stake in the local economy - which goes hand in hand with our proposals for local enterprise partnerships.

Of course, this is not without its challenges.

There are important issues we need to work out.

We need to keep protecting the most vulnerable councils, who don't have a strong tradition of private enterprise. We won't simply be cutting all councils loose.

And we need to make sure the business community has the certainty and stability it needs.

I want to give councils the green light to become more innovative and work more closely with business - not to rack up the business rates.

But I think with your input, we can sort these issues out sensibly.

We can strike a new balance.

So those councils who can be more self-sufficient, aren't trapped in a financial straightjacket anymore.

And all councils, whatever their circumstances, are rewarded for promoting growth.

So in the short term, I know that councils have got some tough decisions to make.

But I also feel very optimistic about the long term.

I believe that in a relatively short period, councils will be almost unrecognisable from today.

Much stronger, more dynamic, more powerful.

With political autonomy and financial independence.

And with a much more direct, responsive, relationship to residents.

The most ambitious, the most innovative councils are already heading down that road.

There is a tremendous opportunity for everyone to follow suit.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Church House Conference Centre, London",,,,26-Jan-2011,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

I am delighted to be invited to speak here today.

Looking back at over the last few months we have seen fire rescue authorities exemplifying all that we rightly value in a public service. We clearly saw just how much we depend on fire and rescue as a high-performing emergency service in the public disorder that we saw on our streets this summer. The professionalism of fire crews during the riots was inspirational and I thank them all for their efforts.

As we look to the coming year we need to be prepared to be bolder, go further, and truly embed the new relationship that is the very heart of the Coalition Government's ambition - putting power back where it belongs. This means power moving away from Whitehall, back to where it belongs - to communities and the locally elected councillors who represent them.

And doing this means letting go of some of the control. I am pleased to report a really good example of this - it looks like you and the heritage sector, including The National Trust and the Historic Houses Association, plan to undertake to improve compliance with the Fire Safety Order in listed buildings.

We strongly believe that the Fire Safety Order strikes the right balance in terms of affording an appropriate level of protection to the public and employees in the wide range of buildings in which they work, visit and live. But we do know that an inconsistency of application causes concerns, especially amongst smaller businesses such as bed and breakfasts.

In the bad old days Government would have stepped in with national guidance, but now, we trust you to come together at a national level, to work with the heritage sector to find practical solutions and to produce guidance owned by all of the sectors involved. This is Government helping and facilitating, but getting out of the way for the stuff you do best.

## The Localism Act

The successful passage through parliament of what I can now proudly call the Localism Act is a milestone is another example of letting go of control and giving back power.

For fire and rescue authorities the Act will give greater freedoms and flexibilities. It provides stand alone fire and rescue authorities with a similar power to local authorities' general power of competence; a wide ranging power related to their single-purpose status. We have also removed the existing burdensome charging arrangements so that adding new charging categories will now be subject to a local consultation.

The Act will also help increase transparency and accountability across Whitehall, local government and fire and rescue authorities, bringing greater visibility and openness to all, providing communities with the information they need to hold their elected representatives accountable.

## National Framework

I know you have been discussing the National Framework today and with the principles I have just outlined in mind I thought it would be helpful for me to touch on my intentions for the new National Framework and the consultation I plan to launch shortly.

The draft framework will mark a key milestone in resetting the relationship between Government and fire and rescue authorities. It will propose moving away from prescription, enabling fire and rescue authorities to deliver their services in a way that makes sense locally, whilst continuing to meet the wider needs of national resilience.

It is my intention for it to build on existing notable practice by fire and rescue authorities, and seek to promote accountability to communities, partnership working and data transparency.

The best thing central Government can do to improve the services provided by fire and rescue authorities and the professionals they employ is not to micro manage from the centre, but to provide an overall strategic direction and support, to empower and encourage them but not to interfere in the way in which they serve their communities.

In short Government needs to get out the way.

It is not the role of the draft framework to recite the entire role of fire and rescue authorities.

I would not expect the framework to repeat all of fire and rescue authorities' duties in connection to the discharge of their functions, nor other duties such as those of an employer or public service provider.

These obligations are already set out in statute and I know that fire and rescue authorities are aware of them.

The priorities I intend to propose in the draft framework will be for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * identify and assess the full range of fire and rescue related risks their area faces, make provision for prevention and protection activities and to respond to incidents appropriately
  * work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and
  * be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

I also envisage the draft framework to reflect our work together on national resilience. To:

  * define what we mean by national resilience in relation to fire and rescue services
  * determine the respective roles of fire and rescue authorities and Government in delivering national resilience; and
  * identify the associated issues that arise in the context of cross border working such as interoperability within the service as a whole and multi-agency interoperability.

By national resilience, we mean resilience to those risks that need to be planned for on a strategic, national basis because their impacts and consequences would be of such scale and/or complexity that local resources would be overwhelmed, even when taking into account mutual aid arrangements, pooling and reconfiguration of resources and collective action.

We can only prepare effectively for such risks if we have a bottom-up approach to resilience, based on local expertise and knowledge.

Local leadership is essential to ensure that fire and rescue authorities have the necessary capability in place to keep their communities safe, and to respond to all incidents and emergencies, irrespective of whether the incidents and emergencies are of a local, cross-border or national nature.

We learnt from FiReControl that top-down Government-imposed solutions that do not have the full buy in and involvement of the sector do not work.

In the draft framework, we will commit to ensuring that appropriate, agreed strategic governance arrangements are in place to enable fire and rescue authorities to collectively engage with Government on national resilience issues.

We have begun discussing these and we will be working with partners over the coming months to ensure that these arrangements are in place by the time any new framework comes into force.

However, having freed up fire and rescue authorities from bureaucratic inspection regimes and tick box assessments, we will also be looking for improved scrutiny at the local level and assurance of delivery - both to government and communities. This is not unreasonable given the public safety nature of the service.

## Control Rooms

I mentioned FiReControl and wanted to briefly touch on the new scheme I announced in July 2011 to build national resilience and improve efficiency and inter-operability through locally-determined solutions and encourage collaboration.

Government is making £81 million available to fund locally initiated proposals for improving resilience and efficiency and a further £1.8 million to fund cross-cutting proposals for improving interoperability within the fire service as a whole.

We are currently examining bids and are on track to complete the bid review process early in the New Year.

## Funding

We have taken tough decisions necessary to get public spending under control. No-one in this room is under any illusions about the wider economic challenges we face today.

You know that my view is that whilst, the funding settlement has been tough, it was a fair one in a difficult environment and I have met with many of you over the last year and listened to your concerns about funding.

Lets be clear. Over the last ten years the fire and rescue service has done a fantastic job at bringing the risk/number of fires down. Fires have decreased by more than a third in the last ten years. However the resource behind the service has not decreased at the same at the same rate - and while there is a strong case for protecting staffing levels at a good rate, is it reasonable that in a time of falling need that staffing levels have actually increased?

Innovative fire and rescue authorities have already shown that it is possible to make efficiency savings without impacting on the outcomes they deliver for their local communities and here we need for all fire and rescue authorities to start looking to how they can achieve these same outcomes.

Local Government Resource Review

Our proposals for business rates retention represent a fundamental shift in the way local authorities are funded, freeing councils from dependence upon central Government grant and giving them a strong financial incentive to drive local economic growth.

We have consulted upon options for the treatment of fire and rescue authorities in the proposed system of business rates retention and are carefully considering the responses. I can assure you that we will take account of all submissions that fire and rescue services have made as we consider the responses to the consultation.

## Capital Grant

We also recently consulted on the distribution of capital grant funding. We sought views on the proposal that future funding be distributed based on a combination of:

  * an efficiency fund, administered via a bidding process; and
  * A pro rata distribution using the current distribution method.

We have considered the views of the sector and have decided to give fire and rescue authorities more time to prepare bids for capital. Therefore the current pro rata distribution method will remain in place for 2012-13.

However, subsequent to this, the allocation of capital will be a combination of distribution and bids with a one off bidding round for 2013-15 funds.

This decision means that fire and rescue authorities will have longer to consider and plan their bids that can target efficiency savings while demonstrating value for money and we will publish more detailed guidance for the bidding in the New Year.

## Conclusion

There is no doubt that these are challenging times. Your drive and your expertise are essential to meeting the challenges we face. So I welcome the start you have made, and look forward to continuing to work with you in the spirit with which you have begun.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,St John's Hotel - Solihull,,,,29-Nov-2011,supporting-fire-and-rescue-authorities-to-reduce-the-number-and-impact-of-fires,,,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/1876257,Future of local public audit,"* * *

The Minister of State for Housing and Local Government (Mr. Grant Shapps):

On 13 August 2010 my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced plans to disband the Audit Commission, transfer the work of the Commission's in-house practice into the private sector, and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

Since the announcement, my Department has worked closely with other Government departments, the Audit Commission, the National Audit Office, the accountancy profession, local government and health sectors and other partners to design the new framework. I am now publishing, for initial consultation, our detailed proposals, which are a continuation of the Government's desire to increase the independence of local public bodies and their accountability to local people, while maintaining clear accountability, through Ministers, to Parliament. I have placed a copy of the consultation paper in the Library of the House.

Our proposals follow a set of design principles: localism and decentralisation; transparency; lower audit fees; and high standards of auditing. We have also been guided by the established principles of public audit, including the independence of public sector auditors from the organisations being audited and the wider scope of public audit.

The new framework mirrors that already in place for the audit of companies. If audit firms wish to become statutory local auditors, they will need to fulfil the rules and arrangements of the professional bodies that are designated as ""Recognised Supervisory Bodies"" by the Financial Reporting Council. They will therefore be mainly self-regulated.

The overarching issue is how to ensure levels of assurance are maintained in the new framework, without creating a complex bureaucratic system which places additional costs and burdens on councils. Strong accountability to Parliament through accounting officers will be retained, while decision making on auditor appointment's selection will be decentralised.

The Department of Health is considering the governance and accountability arrangements for the new health landscape and these will help determine the appropriate audit arrangements. The local public bodies referred to in the consultation paper do not, therefore, include local health bodies. However, I will be undertaking a further consultation on the arrangements for the audit of all local public bodies for which auditors are currently appointed by the Audit Commission, including health bodies, when I publish my draft audit Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny. The Department of Health will publish a paper summarising its proposals at the same time.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,,written-statement,30-Mar-2011,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

You may have heard of the 'Stockholm Syndrome' - it describes how hostages held by a gang of Swedish bankrobbers back in 1973 began to sympathise with their captors.

It is now an accepted psychological term - and it describes how hostages can be captured not just physically but sometimes also mentally.

They lose track of which decisions are in their own true best interests.

Some of those hostages in Stockholm actually even ended up resisting rescue!

I think some Councils are in danger of exhibiting similar behaviour - of still looking to central government to tell them what to do.

And that's what I want to talk about today.

But I'd like to start by thanking Westminster City Council for agreeing to host us and, of course, for definitely not being in the 'Stockholm Syndrome' camp, as a hostage of central government.

I am also grateful to all of you for coming to listen.

Though, as you're about to hear, I want you to spend less time listening to me and more time listening to your residents!

### Decentralising power

This Government wants to set you free - to break the topdown chain of command.

In education, health, planning, housing and policing we are decentralising power like never before - letting people take control.

We are intent on creating the Big Society.

And to do this we must free you to do the job you actually signed up for.

I can't imagine any of you decided to go into public service to be a 'jobs worth' - but sometimes that's exactly what we have forced you to be.

It's not your fault.

### Old Role of Local Government

For too long central government has held local government in a strait jacket - tightly restricting your movement.

Making you into bean counters, and form fillers….

It made you inspect this, and audit that….

It tied you up in red tape. It stopped you from listening to your residents.

And that led some to make ludicrous decisions to ban things which never needed banning.

The papers are full of stories of people too scared to clear ice from their door steps, to organise village fetes, or to pick up litter.

Last week, in Dorset, a good citizen found televisions fly-tipped at the side of a road.

He picked them up and took them to the local recycling centre, only to be told by council officials he couldn't leave them there as ""fly-tipped waste is not legally considered household waste"".

People have even been fined by councils for the 'offence' of putting 'domestic refuse' in a public litter bin.

Sorry but this is plain bonkers.

We should be encouraging good behaviour.

We need to change attitudes and introduce common sense.

Councils and even our citizens have come to expect the state to be always looking over their shoulder - more Big Brother than Big Society.

### Transparency

When, in fact, the people who should be looking over your shoulders should be your residents.

And they would be amazed to see what you were forced to spend their money on.

Westminster City Council has very kindly done the maths.

They're forced to spend nearly three quarters of a million pounds reporting to Whitehall each year.

That's the equivalent to salaries for 26 teachers, 28 social workers or 44 street cleaners.

They've worked out that the time taken to report to Ministers in one year would take a single local government officer over 7 years of their working life.

And that's not the half of it - their calculations don't include storage costs, data quality costs, IT systems, or management costs.

Let alone all those returns and strategies required by law.

For example, the production of the Local Development Framework - itself so complex that after 5 years only 20 per cent of councils have actually managed to get them filed.

To help slash bureaucracy and drive down costs, residents should know how much you are spending on stuff like this.

And now they will…

Because we're throwing open the books in Whitehall and we think you should do the same.

So from January all of your expenditure over £500 will be open to public scrutiny.

Westminster have already done so - details went on line earlier this month.

Residents know what salaries are being paid and what expenses are being claimed.

And they should do - after all it's their money.

And quite frankly I still think some chief exec salaries are too high.

The Localism Bill will now help raise questions about those enormous top salaries.

Some people seem to think it's a tougher job to run a local council than to run the country. How else could they justify being paid more than the PM?

In future top salaries will be voted on by the full council and they should be doing that in public.

And of course Ministers will continue to want to be helpful by shining a light when we think things are going wrong.

Today, the new force to be reckoned with is transparency, rather than Whitehall diktat.

And as we saw with the pay cut sensibly taken by the LGA Chief Executive just yesterday, transparency is a potent force.

That transparency will lead to accountability - because we know that public scrutiny is far better at making Councils take the right decisions than Whitehall targets.

### New opportunities

My three children come home from our local primary school with gold stars and merit badges when their headteacher thinks they've done something good.

But I shouldn't be acting like your head teacher -  telling you to sit on the Thunder Cloud for being bad or in the Sunshine Corner when you get things right.

That isn't a model for a grown-up relationship.

So rather than desperately seeking gold star ratings from Ministers you should be hankering after the approval of your residents.

Councils should no longer look up to Whitehall - you need to look out.

Outwards to the people you serve.

And this Government will give you the necessary space to do precisely that.

  * We are abolishing Comprehensive Area Assessments and those Local Area Agreements.
  * We have axed the National Indicator Set.
  * So that from next year, there will be just one list of every bit of data that Government needs from you.
  * We're relinquishing control over nearly 5000 targets. And you can decide to ditch them or keep them - as you see fit.
  * And rather than looking to Whitehall for their powers, local authorities will be free to act.

So as long as it's not illegal - you will be free to do it.

We're calling this 'The General Power of Competence'.

And to go with this power we're giving you control over the purse strings too.

We're taking more than £2bn out of the ringfence.

And it'll be up to you to work with the residents in your community to decide how you will spend the money.

When it comes to housing, we are abolishing top down targets for building new homes and introducing a powerful incentive - the New Homes Bonus.

Today I can also announce the abolition of the Strategic Housing Inspections.

I have asked Audit Commission not to commission any new Strategic Housing Inspections.

Quite frankly I think they were a waste of your resident's money - nearly one and a half million pounds of the public's cash was going to be spent this year making you work to Whitehall's priorities - not your residents.

We will also be throwing the inefficient and unfair Housing Revenue Account system in the bin.

This all adds up to a massive transfer of power from us to you.

### Councils response

But are councils really ready for this Town Hall revolution?

Some I think are.

Today Westminster has announced their own commitment to slash red tape - a full audit of their own regulations and burdens so they can scrap those which simply aren't needed.

They're quite literally I understand turning off the red lights.

Working with the police and Transport for London they're identifying 25 sites where removing traffic lights can be done safely; improving traffic flows, and saving time and money - and helping Londoners to get about.

They will reduce regular inspections of local business premises. So that businesses with a track record of high standards will receive fewer audits.

Again, saving businesses and the Council, time and money.

But there are others who seem to be afraid to seize the freedom to act.

Their case of 'Stockholm Syndrome' is clearly well advanced.

Some are tied to Whitehall's 'nanny state apron strings' terrified of being cut loose.

But cut loose you are.

You have been set free.

The people, your residents, rather than Whitehall, are now, officially, calling the shots.

And you have the opportunity to display your own entrepreneurial spirit.

In Government we have set ourselves a rule - if we want to introduce a new regulation we have take one out first.

The one in, one out rule now applies across Whitehall.

So today I'm suggesting you might want to adopt the same rule of thumb in your council.

After all I have already changed the law so you can get rid of outdated bye-laws without wasting time and money getting the Secretary of State's approval.

It's now up to you.

There are some ridiculous bye-laws that can be scrapped  
straight away.

If Gloucester City Council can now decide whether fish frying in public should be banned.

And if Hammersmith and Fulham really want to continue to regulate the use of Dickie straps and skidpans - well that's their choice alone.

So why don't you go through all of your byelaws - not just the ridiculous ones you won't miss - but the one's which stop you and your residents applying common sense.

Whitehall will no longer be looking over your shoulder forcing your staff to be 'jobs worths'.

### Conclusion

We will shortly introduce 'The Localism Bill'.

It will formally transfer responsibility to local communities to decide what happens where you live.

Instead of looking to me, it will require you to look to the people that you serve.

Indeed next time you get an invitation to come and hear what I have to say - maybe you should just reply that you are too busy listening to your residents to accept! Thank you.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/articles/newsroom/zerocarbon,Government is serious about zero carbon,"* * *

Sustainability of buildings is crucial to carbon reduction in Britain. I've fought for years to get greener buildings taken seriously by successive governments, and so I'm delighted that a zero carbon target for new builds was confirmed by the chancellor in March's Budget.

If we're serious about reducing our carbon emissions, we need to do it in the most practical and cost-effective way we can. Buildings account for almost half the carbon emissions we produce each year and more carbon emissions come from our homes than our cars, so it is vital that we all play our part in reducing emissions from the built environment. That means not just headline policies for new build, but serious action on our existing stock too.

The zero carbon challenge for house builders and developing associations is tough but deliverable. Developers will be responsible for dealing with emissions from the homes themselves, as covered by building regulations, but not for offsetting all the (unknowable) carbon emissions of householders' appliances. Compared with the original definition of zero carbon, we estimate this approach will cost around £4,000 for a typical semi in 2017, rather than the £28,000 of the original definition. It will still save a lot of carbon.

But that's not good enough. There are early indications that those zero carbon homes already constructed are not living up to their name. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation's evaluation of its Elm Tree Mews development found that, though residents were comfortable and pleased with their heating bills, the homes were losing 54 per cent more heat than they were designed to. The report concludes that many processes and cultures within the industry and its supply chain need to change if zero carbon is to be more than an empty slogan.

I intend to make sure that performance equals design - real compliance with the new definition will almost double the carbon saved compared with the exemplars tested so far.

Three-quarters of the buildings that will be standing in 2050 have already been built. So it is vital that we tackle existing homes too. That's why we're pushing ahead with the green deal and planning changes to the building regulations that will promote a radical programme of retrofitting for existing homes. Combined with effective delivery of standards on new homes, we can make the big inroads we need in cutting the housing sector's carbon emissions.

Other key tools will be the code for sustainable homes and locally-driven initiatives. We're upgrading the code to ensure that it takes in to account (and in some cases goes beyond) the latest developments in regulations, as well as focusing it on the key purpose of carbon reduction. This means the code will better cover the areas of greatest significance, remove unnecessary duplication and be clearer. The code's revision underlines the government's commitment to greener and more sustainable buildings, while also ensuring unfair burdens are not imposed on builders.

At local level, we need a menu of additional actions that a local authority can draw from when setting sustainable planning and building standards, encouraging ambition but also simplifying the current wide range of variants. This menu will reflect the inputs of both the industry and local councils, rather than being another top-down decision by central government.

The coalition's commitment to 'being the greenest government ever' is taken seriously at every level. That makes fixing buildings a top priority. We know that improving F and G-rated homes saves more carbon per pound spent than anything else, so that must be the top priority. Getting new homes to perform at their design standard comes next. Slogans come last. Watch this space.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/abolitionregionalstrategies,Government response to the Communities and Local Government Committee's report: abolition of regional spatial strategies,"* * *

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr Eric Pickles): I have today laid before Parliament the Government Response to the Communities and Local Government Committee's Report: Abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies: a planning vacuum (Cm 8103). Copies are available in the Vote Office.

I welcome the Committee's report and I have carefully considered its findings. The debate has helped to inform the amendments that we made to the Localism Bill at the Commons Report stage to strengthen the duty to cooperate and my Department will continue to take the findings into account as policy is developed.

The Government's top priority in reforming the planning system is to promote sustainable economic growth and jobs. We made clear in the Growth Review that our top priority in introducing the National Planning Policy Framework will be to support long term sustainable growth, through both development plans and decisions on planning applications.

We have made it plain that our decision to remove Regional Strategies was based on clear evidence that they did not work. We are determined to address this through our clear and comprehensive approach to reform: promoting economic growth and recovery through incentives such as the New Homes Bonus and a reformed Community Infrastructure Levy; encouraging local authorities to work together effectively across their boundaries through a strengthened duty to co-operate; and driving house building by combining the incentives we are introducing with the removal of top down targets.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,23-Jun-2011,,,giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/1894820,Grand Designs Live 2011: self build hits the mainstream,"* * *

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

This is the first time I've been to Grand Designs - it's impressive.

I should have expected nothing less as Kevin McCloud is involved.

My very first visit as Housing Minister was to Kevin's West Country development where they were pushing the boundaries of design and eco-building.

And we've all seen Grand Designs on the TV. Self-build schemes that are almost always startling in scale and ambition.

Many of the projects featured involve large budgets, complicated project management, and cutting edge design. It makes for great telly.

But if Kevin's TV programme was all we knew about Self-Build, only very brave souls would be foolish enough to try it.

Yes, the results are usually fantastic but the effort and heartache to get there is just plain scary.

Should it really be that hard?

I think everyone on this panel, including Kevin, will agree that we want self-build to be an option for everyone.

### Self-Build For All

Building your own house should be a common way for people to have a home.

People know what sort of house they want to live in.

But too often they are forced to buy one that doesn't quite match their needs, let alone their dreams.

Too many people end up living in identikit boxes that wouldn't look out of place in Legoland. Come to think of it, Lego homes often look better!

Why shouldn't more people be able to build their own dream?

The overwhelming majority of self builders choose to do so because they want to create a home they want.

That's why about one in five of Britain's new homes each year are self-built despite the difficulties.

Anyone who has tried it here - is just starting to think about it - or indeed has just watched Kevin's programme - knows all about the problems people face.

In fact the UK has one of the lowest proportions of self-build in Europe.

In Germany for example, more than half of all homes are self build projects.

As Housing Minister I want to help make self-build easier.

### Self Build Working Group

So, I set up a Industry working group to look at what needs to be done to help more ordinary people build their own home.

I've asked them to put together an action plan to address four key barriers.

Firstly, finance - it should be easier to raise the money needed for self-build projects. I want to see what can be done to get more lenders entering the self build market. We need more specialist finance products in the market. I think there's a real business opportunity here.

Secondly, land should be easier to find for self builders. I want to see what action can be taken to encourage the public and private sectors to work together to make more plots available for self builders.

Thirdly, I want to see what further action is needed to reduce the burden of regulation and simplify the planning process for self builders.

And fourthly the self build industry needs to be more joined up and ready to help self builders.

Ted Stevens, from the National Self Build Association who is playing a leading role on our working group will tell you more about what progress the group have made shortly.

I'll be interested to hear how they're getting on and I'm looking forward to their report back this Summer.

But self-build isn't a new idea and people are already taking action.

### Community Self-Build

I'm particularly interested in  community-led self build.

Like the schemes promoted by the Community Self Build Agency who are working with homeless ex-servicemen to not only help them build their own homes, but also provide them with a trade. They will be trained so later they can get a job.

Some people say they are puzzled by what the Big Society means.

I think community self-build is a perfect example of what we mean - people getting together to build their own homes - almost literally building the big society.

Community self-build projects will become easier through the Community Right to Build that I'm introducing through the Localism Bill.

Our proposals, which should become law by the end of the year, will enable communities to bring forward the developments that they want.

And it's not just about small villages in rural areas, The Right to Build will now apply as much in urban areas as in rural areas.

### Plot Lands

And there are other possibilities opening up.

I am keen to promote the plot concept of self-build where serviced plots of land and development finance, is available to people who wish to self-build.

Individuals could then engage an architect or commission a builder to manage the build of their own home.

And let's be clear - 'self-built' doesn't necessarily mean DIY. In fact, less than ten per cent of self builds are DIY. Most self-builders commission architects and builders.

Providing plots reduces the risks for the self builder and is a tried and tested business model abroad.

I want to help make it work here.

This Government is releasing more publicly owned land to build new homes and I will shortly be announcing what land we will be earmarking exclusively for self-builders.

And if it works I am sure that the market will want to meet the demand.

### Conclusion

If we make self-build easier - it will become more common.

If we release the energy and creativity of people's dreams, we will create a self-build revolution in this country.

We will also see how self build can enhance the quality of design and encourage more sustainable buildings.

If done right, self-build can contribute to diverse places that meet high standards of sustainability.

We all have different needs, different ideas, different dreams.

People don't want to live in identikit homes.

That's why people want to build their own homes to their own designs.

And if we succeed in helping them then we really will have ""Grand Designs for all"".",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"ExCel, London",,,,3-May-2011,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/growingbigsociety,Growing the Big Society,"* * *

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

### I. Introduction

The Big Society is a big idea, but what it comes down to is this:

Our answer to collectivism isn't just individualism.

As human beings, it is in our nature to join together to achieve common goals.

There are two ways in which this joining can work:

From the top-down, through hierarchy mediated by bureaucracy - and which invades civil society by sucking everything towards itself in the name of ""stakeholding.""

Or from the bottom-up, through diverse forms of self-organisation.

The former is what defines socialism.

The latter is what defines conservatism - and, for that matter, liberalism.

#### The three strands

Last week, in Liverpool, David Cameron unpacked this basic idea.

The Big Society, he said, consists of three strands:

Firstly, public sector reform.

Secondly, community empowerment.

And thirdly, philanthropic action.

Though these strands are intertwined, they are also distinct:

The first is about what the state can do for us.

The second is about what we can do for ourselves.

And the third is about what we can do for others.

All three are essential to the Big Society.

For instance, public services can either be delivered in a way that increases dependency and undermines pro-social behaviour, or the state can intervene in order to strengthen the ability of people to look after themselves and others.

Alongside the traditional public services, we also need a much clearer concept of communities of shared interest, which act together in their own way to achieve those interests. Local councils are an obvious example, but there are many more beyond the state, including voluntary organisations, faith communities, friendly societies, co-operatives and social enterprises. The more we get away from the idea of a single source of help, delivered by a unitary state, ruling over a monolithic public sector, the closer we will get to a Big Society.

Finally there is the third strand, which is the grace of undiluted altruism - as delivered by charities, social enterprises, volunteers and givers of all descriptions. This is the purest expression of the Big Society, and so in our enthusiasm to reform our public services and empower strong communities, it is vital that we don't overlook the blessing of selfless philanthropy.

#### The three methods

As well as this three-fold explanation of what the Big Society is, the Prime Minister also set out the three basic methods by which government can act to build it up:

These are decentralisation, transparency and a third category that I'm going to refer to as social finance.

Again, these are intertwined, but also readily distinguished.

Transparency is about the redistribution of **knowledge**: The state must stop withholding information that would allow a much wider range of actors to identify social needs and propose new ways of meeting them.

Social finance is about the redistribution of **money** and other assets. Instead of passing down through layers of absorbent bureaucracy, public funds should get straight through to wherever and whoever can use them most effectively. This means contestable contracts, payment by results and a revolution in the availability of upfront investment for social purposes. It also means communities having the right to save, run and own buildings and other under-used assets for social purposes when they could do that job best.

Of course, there's no point in making information and funding available to new providers of social goods, if they aren't allowed to use them in new ways. Thus the third and most fundamental building block of the Big Society is decentralisation, which is, of course, about the redistribution of **power**.

### II: The turning tide

As minister for decentralisation, it is the issue of power that I'm going to focus on today, though no doubt knowledge and money will come into it too.

I'm going to start off with the commonly-made observation that Britain is one of the most centralised countries in the democratic world.

The political culture of this country has been shaped by successive waves of centralisation:  
Not just in respect of the balance of power between central and local government, but also in the disempowerment of the professions in the public sector; and in the way that voluntary organisations have been pushed out of the provision of public services - despite the pivotal role they played in their creation.

However, the tide is turning.

The formation of the Coalition Government represents a genuinely new beginning, the significance of which goes well beyond a mere change in administration.

While the centralisation of power reached its apogee under Gordon Brown - the process did not begin with New Labour.

And though the failure of centralism was first understood on the centre-right of British politics, there are occasional signs of enlightenment on the centre-left too.

Indeed only this month a rueful Tony Blair conceded, ""people want an empowering state, not a controlling state… Government today has got to put the power in the hands of people… that's not a slogan, it's actually a demand from the public.""

Tony Blair headed a Government where this was a key point of contention between its two constituent parts - the Blairites and the Brownites.

Today, we have another Government of two constituent parts - the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.

But, this time, localism is what most unites us.

So, for the first time in decades, the most powerful forces in British politics are aligned in favour of decentralisation.

So, that being the case, how do we proceed?

Well, I won't be making a detailed policy presentation on this occasion - although I will in a series of speeches during the months ahead.

There'll also be plenty of that in the Localism and Decentralisation Bill that we will introduce in the autumn.

But today, I want to set out the fundamentals of our approach:

The fundamental ideas behind our decentralisation agenda.

And the fundamental actions by which we will pursue this agenda.

### III Initiative, speech and resilience: starting from the bottom-up

In a moment I'll start with the fundamental ideas. But before that, I've got a confession to make:  
As well as being the minister for decentralisation, I'm also the minister with responsibility for central planning.

Yes, I know - ironies galore.

Fortunately, this other role is limited to nationally important infrastructure.

And even here we're doing our bit for the Big Society, by removing the power of final decision from unaccountable quangos and giving it to ministers accountable to Parliament.

What I won't be centrally planning, however, is our decentralisation agenda.

It would be perfectly possible for me to do so.

I could, like ministers have done before, play around with the structure of local government and decide exactly who should do what and where.

I could tinker with the chain of command that links the various tiers of public administration and even co-opt the occasional outside contractor.

Looking back over the years, it seems as if the secret wish of every minister was for a war room where they could push pieces around a great big map.

That, however, would hardly be consistent with the ethos of decentralisation.

Last week in Liverpool, David Cameron introduced four vanguard communities who are eager to start putting the Big Society into practice.

These aren't communities that we've chosen; they chose themselves.

Furthermore, each will be pursuing Big Society projects of their own devising; taking on a blend of powers and responsibilities most appropriate to their priorities.

From a central government point of view there is no agenda other than to learn how we can best help each community achieve their own vision of the Big Society.

This stands in obvious contrast to the old approach, which was for Whitehall to devise a pilot project, test it out on subject communities, and then roll-out the results nationwide.

This reminds me of the way that antidotes to poisons are produced.

First of all, you inject a small dose of the toxin into the flesh of a large mammal like a horse. Then you extract the resulting antibodies for use on human patients.

It is an approach that might work in medicine, but not in the social sphere.

Scaling-up identical antidotes to social problems doesn't work because each community has its own problems and needs to find its own solutions.

Moreover, no one wants to be the horse's backside.

#### Small beginnings

But what about the problem of replication?

If a community hits upon a really good idea, one that could make a much wider impact, then what's the point of confining it to just one project?

Isn't the only way forward a programme of mass injection?

There's a very good answer to that and it comes from Bangladesh.

In 1974, an economist called Muhammad Yunus was wondering how he could help his countrymen in the wake of a terrible famine.

What he did was to lend just $27 to a group of 42 families.

Not only did this allow them to escape the clutches of predatory loan sharks, it gave them the confidence and ability to start investing in the own futures; for instance, by buying a few head of livestock to generate a little additional income - enough to rise above the level of subsistence, enough to finance further investments.

From this small beginning, Yunus didn't just found the now world-famous Grameen Bank, but also established the practice of microcredit as a powerful weapon in the fight against global poverty.  
Looking back on those early days, Yunus made the following observation:

> ""It never crossed my mind to ask, ""will this solve the problem of 50 million poor people in Bangladesh?"" I was simply asking myself, ""can I do something to help the villagers of Jobra?"" When I solved the problem of a few people, I felt encouraged. I realised that all I had to do was to keep on repeating it. As a result, microcredit became a global phenomenon. If you know how to lend money to five people, you have learned how to do it for five thousand people - or five hundred million.""

#### Seeds and speed

Millions of different people, but also, if I might add, millions of different ways. Because in each case the money is used by the recipient for an individual purpose suited to individual circumstances.

But can you imagine what a Whitehall version of the Grameen Bank would have looked like?

Let me paint you a picture:

First of all, a committee is established to decide what kind of livestock should be made available under the loan scheme.

Having eventually settled on the goat, a further set of committees is then appointed to decide what breed of goat.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister convenes a special conference to unveil the new bank's official logo. Perhaps featuring a goat motif. Probably designed by Damien Hirst.

Oh, and don't forget the czar and a taskforce.  No government idea is complete without one of each.  
After flying out to Bangladesh with his taskforce and a team of management consultants, the czar proudly announces far-reaching plans for a series of regional goat-distribution centres.

Some of these even get built.

Some years later, and with a new Prime Minister in office it is decided that goats are passe.

Not only is there to be an exciting new emphasis on chickens, but it is also decided that the bank should be re-established on an international basis.

After much discussion, the bank is finally re-launched with a new name and logo under a steering group composed of recently-retired bankers, officials and perhaps even an ex-Prime Minister.

Sadly, after two years of disappointing results, a report commissioned from a different team of management consultants concludes that, with the benefit of hindsight, lending small sums of money to subsistence farmers was never going to work.

The subsequent policy review recommends that, in future, money should only be lent to sovereign governments - a point which the former prime minister enthusiastically endorses.

OK, so this is a farcical scenario.

But surely if you want to spread a good idea fast, surely you need a grand government scheme to give it legs?

Mohammed Yunus takes a different view.

He argues that the fastest way to make progress is to start small:

> ""For those who are considering becoming involved in social business, you don't have to wait. You can see the impact right away - not on the whole of society, but on a portion of it… It's not necessary to wait to see the impact on millions of people. ""Millions"" is a big number. But if your work has a positive impact on five or ten people, you have invented a seed. Now you can plant it a million times.""

If this approach can work in Bangladesh, it can certainly work in Britain.

Enjoying, as we do, the full benefits of the information age, there is every opportunity for good ideas to spread quickly.

All the more so, when decentralisation is combined with government transparency and access to social finance.

#### Risk and resilience

And there is further advantage to locally-led innovation - which is the freedom to take risks.  
Not every innovation will succeed. Some will fail.

But the roll-out of standard models across the country offers no greater protection against failure.  It just means that the cost of failure will be nationwide.

That is why central government is averse to innovation - preferring to fail in old and familiar ways, rather than risk new ones.

However, when innovation is small-scale, the failures can stay that way, while the successes can spread - proven by experience.

In other words, you lose small, but win big.

So as well as speed, the bottom-up approach has the advantage of resilience.

### IV: Actions

I hope I've communicated something of the ideas behind our decentralisation policy and why they differ from what's gone on before.

You have seen how we are already putting them into action.

For instance, by allowing parents to establish new 'free schools' where they decide they want something different to what is on offer.

Or by allowing people to vote for a commissioner who will hold their local police force to account.  
We will take fundamental actions such as these across the whole of government.

Because, I'm not proposing that ministers should just sit back while local communities get on with the job.

Local innovators need a government that actively supports them in their endeavours.

#### Breaking the chains

The most basic thing we can do to help is to remove the most obvious and outrageous impositions on local freedom.

By this I mean the targets, the inspections, the directives, ring-fencing, regulations and general bureaucracy by which the centre suppresses local initiative.

We're making good progress on this already - especially in regard to local government.  
We're abolishing the Regional Spatial Strategies, the Comprehensive Area Assessment, and the Standards Board to mention just three examples.

Our determination to decentralise has astonished those who assume that politicians are always localists in opposition, but centralists in government.

The following is an excerpt from an Eric Pickles interview for Total Politics magazine, here he is talking about the Whitehall reaction to his plans:

> ""I want to put this politely, but occasionally you do things that surprise them. For example when we got rid of the Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA), we were just talking about it.
> 
> They said: ""You want to replace it with what?""
> 
> Nothing.
> 
> ""Yes, okay. But what things do we want local authorities to be judged on? What's the regime?""
> 
> Nothing.
> 
> ""So just to be clear Secretary of State, when you say nothing, what do you mean?""

> Nothing. I mean nothing, absolutely nothing. It's pointless. It doesn't do anything.""

However, as Eric went on to say, there are other regulations that do have a point. Health and safety legislation, for instance.

This was never passed with intention of stifling local innovation, but unfortunately that is very often its effect.

Then there are those barriers that arise from the fact that much of the public sector was constructed without any thought for local control or diversified delivery.

From the post-war period onwards it was simply assumed that control and delivery would be from the top-down, and therefore there was no provision for a future in which this model was challenged.

So, the Big Society faces all kinds of obstacles that are hardwired into the system. They stem from habits of implementation and institutional inertia, as much as deliberate Government policy.

Unlike such things as centrally-set targets or regional quangos, they can't be simply swept aside at the stroke of a pen.

Thus the decentralisation of power depends on three further fundamental actions:

#### Rights not privileges

The first of these is a Right to Know. When public money is being spent, people should generally be able to see how much is being spent and on what. This should apply to central government, local government and all public bodies that disburse public funds.

Transparency is the foundation of accountability. It is also a powerful means of promoting efficiency, without requiring the heavy-handed intervention of an unaccountable bureaucracy.

The Right to Know can become much more powerful if it is joined with a second fundamental action - establishing what I call the Right of Challenge.

The consumers - and potential producers - of public services should have the right to change the way that public resources are deployed wherever and whenever a better proposal can be found.

Judgements on these proposals should be made at the most local level possible - thereby enabling communities to truly take control of their own development.

We should send a clear message to various public sector bureaucracies that their duty is to facilitate the decentralisation of power.

Communities must stand before the bureaucracy as free agents demanding what is theirs, not as supplicants begging for scraps of freedom.

That is why this government views self-determination as a right and not a privilege.

#### Turning government upside down

The third fundamental action that we need to take is to change the very nature of central government.

Since becoming a minister, I have experienced the way in which the enormous resources of the state are placed at the disposal of the political and bureaucratic chain of command.

On one level, I am very grateful for this. My civil servants work diligently to keep me informed, to open channels of communication and to overcome obstacles to those parts of the Coalition programme for which I'm responsible.

However, I am acutely conscious that the experience that others have of the state can be very different: in particular, the institutions of civil society that, far from being helped by the bureaucracy, are often hindered by it.

If we want change to happen at the most local level, then we have to understand that at such a scale even the slightest bureaucratic hurdle looms large.

Furthermore, it is very difficult for community institutions to get the help they need to get around these obstacles.

This is because centralised regulatory systems are designed to make demands on those at the receiving end of regulation, not to respond to demands for help when regulation gets in the way of local initiative.

By the time they reach down to the local level, the various branches of government are too specialised to recognise the big picture needs of the communities they interact with  and are - equipped only to implement the commands of a distant source of authority.

The paradox is that, at the point where they come together, it is not the local community that is too small, but central government.

That is why we need to turn central government upside down and inside-out.

Instead of the civil service only being focused upwards on providing advice to Ministers - and inwards on its own priorities - we must drive the focus downwards and outwards to put those resources at the service of communities nationwide.

In my own department, I am establishing a ""barrier-busting"" team whose sole purpose will be to help community groups get the backing they need when they encounter bureaucratic obstacles to local objectives.

Sometimes that will mean providing advice on ways around the obstacles. Sometimes it will mean knocking heads together.

Most of all it will mean systematically gathering the evidence we need to tackle the problem at source - by reforming and repealing the legislation and regulation at fault.

The state should exist to serve civil society, not the other way round.

### V: Over to you

So, these are some of the fundamental actions that we propose to take.

But ultimately, and by definition, the success of decentralisation depends on local action.  
Indeed, upon the initiative of some of you in this room today.

Some of you will be pioneers.

Other, just as importantly, will be inspired imitators, shopping around for the best new ideas and customising them for local use.

I hope it won't be long before we see significant public sector reforms spreading from one part of the country to another, without ever having appeared in a Government green or white paper.

That will be a sure sign that Britain has truly decentralised.

And that the Big Society has truly arrived.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

_Speech delivered on behalf of the Secretary of State._

### Introduction

It's a pleasure to be here today to talk to you about the importance of our town centres. Town centres are at the heart of our communities and neighbourhoods. They are the places where we come together, to shop, to work, to relax and be entertained.

This Government is committed to supporting our communities and neighbourhoods, we are therefore committed to helping support our town centres.

I am afraid you will have to wait for the National Planning Framework for the details but I can confirm to you today we continue to support the ""town-centres first"" policy, after all, a Conservative Government introduced it in 1996.

By focusing retail, leisure and office development in our centres we can help ensure that communities and neighbourhoods have easier access to their day-to-day needs gives people have the opportunity to link their trips to other shops and services.

Focusing development in our town centres also ensures people have a wider choice of transport options. This is opposed to out-of-town locations where accessibility for those without a car can be poor, and the range of other facilities on offer can be limited.

But, let me be clear. Supporting town centres does not mean that we are anti big supermarkets. Nor do we oppose out-of-centre development for its own sake. The policy has never been about that and nor should it be. What we do want is the right development in the right place.

### National reforms

We are also committed to wider reform of the planning system to encourage the growth that communities want and need. The bureaucratic and centrally imposed policies and targets we inherited from the previous Government failed. A system that doesn't work creates uncertainty and frustrates growth.

So how will we make this happen? Last week we published the Local Growth White Paper, which set out the Government's economic ambition to build a fairer and more balanced economy, driven by private sector growth. We recognise that an efficient and effective planning system is crucial to enabling growth, which is why we have announced that:

  * We will reform the planning system so that it is driven by communities who want growth, rather then the system we inherited that stifles development and innovation and acts as a barrier to economic recovery.
  * We will introduce a new duty to cooperate on local authorities, statutory undertakers and infrastructure providers to ensure that the right people and groups share information and work together to make the best decisions for their area.
  * We will introduce a presumption in favour of sustainable economic development and introduce a new right for communities to shape their local areas through neighbourhood plans. We will also create a community right to build so that individuals, groups and businesses can deliver small scale development without the need for planning permission.
  * We will fundamentally reform and simplify national planning policy and guidance, presenting to Parliament a simple national planning framework which will cover all forms of development. This framework will establish economic growth as a Government priority for planning, and will lift many of the complex bureaucratic burdens that have slowed down decision-making.

Of course, supporting town centres and reforming the planning is not enough to ensure economic recovery. For our businesses to truly prosper, they need to have the right economic environment - not just the right planning environment. That is why our reforms go wider than simply planning.

### Community Right to Buy

Viable town centres are also key drivers of our economy. We need to make sure all the different elements of our centres are supported. Community facilities are an important element to the health of our centres. The Coalition Programme for Government committed to giving communities new powers to help them save local facilities through a ""community right to buy"" scheme. We will be introducing provisions in the Localism Bill to give effect to this commitment.

As part of our determination to shift power to local neighbourhoods, we will be acting to ensure that community organisations have a fair chance to bid to take over assets and facilities that are important to them, whether that is their village shop or last remaining pub, their community centre, children's centre or library, or a derelict site that could be transformed as a community hub.

This provision gives communities time to put together their bid and raise the capital. Assets will then be sold on the open market at market value.

### Helping businesses

I have outlined how we are returning power and decision making to the local level. But, we want to do more to help create a fairer and more balanced economy driven by private sector strength. The previous Government skewed the country's economy by artificial boundaries and top-down prescription that did not work.

We have set out our ambition but we cannot rebalance the economy and tackle local barriers to growth from the corridors of Whitehall. Local areas have a better understanding of how their economies work, what local priorities should be and how best to tackle them.

That is why last Thursday, within the Local Growth White Paper, we announced the first 24 partnerships that we believe are ready to establish their local enterprise partnership boards and begin dialogue with Government about how we can support them in delivering their economic objectives.

Government's vision for local enterprise partnerships is that they will help transform the economic geography of the country by creating a new local dynamism that will encourage economic growth and protect business with proper local accountability.

Local enterprise partnerships are one part of the picture for local economic renewal, but a critical one, allowing communities and businesses to use their combined weight to support economic growth and renewal, in areas such as housing, planning, transport and skills. Councils and businesses will come together to determine how best to tackle the challenges and address the needs of their local economies.

To support this, the White Paper also declared the £1.4bn Regional Growth Fund open for business. The fund will provide focused investment, support the creation of private sector jobs and will particularly support communities currently dependent on the public sector, helping them make the transition to private sector led growth and prosperity. First round bids for funding are requested by 21 January 2011.

### Helping small businesses

So what are we doing to support small business? We recognise the importance of small businesses - they are a vital part of our economy. That is why we are also committed to helping them. We are already taking a number of steps to help firms with business rates such as:

  * doubling small business rate relief for one year from October - eligible ratepayers with rateable values below £6,000 will pay no rates at all for that year
  * committing to finding a practical way to make Small Business Rate relief automatic to reduce red tape and administrative burdens
  * putting a moratorium on the collection of certain backdated business rates and making a commitment to cancel certain backdated rates bills, such as some unfair backdated rates tax for some port businesses
  * considering the possibility of giving local authorities wide-ranging, discretionary powers to grant business rate discounts, so that they can respond to local circumstances by reducing business rates bills
  * committing to take legislation to ensure that no new supplementary business rate can be imposed without the backing of local firms in a referendum

### Conclusion

In conclusion, we are committed to giving back power to local communities and businesses so that they can truly shape and support the development and growth of their areas.

We are committed to fundamentally reforming and simplifying the planning system. As part of these reforms we will present to Parliament a simple national planning framework which will cover all forms of development.

And we are committed to supporting all elements of the economy - including small business which we recognise as a vital component of a successful and prosperous economy.

We recognise these are difficult times for many businesses across the country, but we are determined to do everything we can to create the right environment for businesses to develop and prosper.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Imperial War Museum, London",,,,2-Nov-2010,improving-high-streets-and-town-centres,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

Last week _The Sun_ told of a mum who dragged her son around Hull on an all-day drinking binge.

The lad, who ended up in hospital, was just 11 years old. I was shocked and saddened.

Thankfully, cases like this are rare but I am sick of the harm caused by illegal drinking, the crime and anti-social behaviour that comes in its wake and those young people who put themselves and others at risk by drinking irresponsibly.

Illegal drinking is a terrible blight on this country.

It makes some of our neighbourhoods unbearable to live in, destroys the peace of mind of innocent people and sucks up huge amounts of public cash to repair the damage done.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/2018321,Helping the high street recover after the riots,"* * *

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

This summer's riots were sad and sorry and shameful.

Businesses went up in smoke after generations serving their community.

Thugs looted and stole as if they had not a care in the world.

And a tiny minority made normal people feel frightened in their own beds.

Utterly disgraceful. Utterly unacceptable.

I was talking to David Lammy yesterday, the MP for Tottenham, who told me a chilling story about Comet, a key retailer in his constituency. In the days after the riot, when the store had re-opened, people were coming in and telling that staff that they would ""be back""; that it would happen again.

And the scale of it.

Between the sixth and the eleventh of August, two thousand businesses were affected.

Over one hundred and fifty families had to leave their homes.

By the end of September, nearly four thousand seven hundred arrests had been made.

As we speak, arrests continue as police go through CCTV footage.

I never, you never, communities, families and decent people never want to see the like again.

Compassion has to be part of the response.

Understanding how a young person - uneducated, unemployed - could come to think it's acceptable to trash their own high street, and make their neighbours' lives misery, has to be part of the response.

But to explain is not to excuse.

And we're talking about violence and thuggery that is far, far beyond the pale.

So the Government has made it clear: The courts have our full backing to do whatever it takes to bring those responsible to justice.

""Everyone else was doing it"" is no excuse.

If you mugged;

If you looted;

If you threatened people's livelihoods and their safety;

We're going to get you.

We all watched those shameful scenes with a heavy heart.

But enormous thanks needs to go to you and gratitude are due to the emergency services who worked so hard, and in such trying conditions. From firefighters, to the police to the ambulance service.

And if the evenings showed people at their worst, the mornings after showed the best of British spirit, people coming together.

I have nothing but praise for local government and local leaders. As the months have passed, my view hasn't changed one iota - local government has been the most flexible of all the agencies involved.

  * Getting support to those who need it most - in Ealing and Birmingham and Tottenham.
  * Coordinating information to head off problems - in Redbridge and Lambeth.
  * And celebrating local pride. How pleased I was to hear those three little words: ""I Love Salford"" - a wonderful act of defiance against the looters.

Meanwhile, hundreds of shopkeepers simply rolled up their sleeves, rolled up their shutters and got back to business.

And I am full of respect for the tens of thousands of people from local communities who refused to let the world take away the impression that the vandals and idiots were in any way representative of their town.

They took up their brooms and came together to renew, repair and rebuild.

Like in Birmingham, where communities stood together and called for calm in the face of terrible provocation.

People of different faiths and all backgrounds said with one loud voice:

""This is our home. And we won't let you ruin it.""

These people are the real face of Britain, and this Government is on their side.

In the hours and days following the riots, our first priority was to help life get back to normal.

As fast and as fully as possible.

Within days, we set out that we would make an exceptional ten million pound fund available to assist councils with immediate clean-up costs.

Thirty-five councils have registered for it.

That money is there to help sweep up broken glass, resurface pavements, and mend street lights.

To support councils to make their town centres safe and clean again.

You claim - we'll pay.

Riots also had a huge and direct impact on the traders and shops who are the heart of communities; the place that we call home. Newsagents, grocers, cafes, laundries.

Within days, we launched a twenty-million-pound fund to help them get back on their feet.

Councils are handing out the cash. And I know many of you are signing the cheques already.

Some have gone one better.

  * Croydon have automatically been paying a thousand pounds out to any business with a police incident number, without the business having to ask for it
  * Manchester have been knocking on doors. Helping people understand what's on offer and fill in the form
  * And in Wolverhampton, they've already got over a hundred thousands pounds earmarked for security blinds.

Now you know me. I think taxpayers have an absolute moral right to demand that public servants be utterly scrupulous in their use of public money, ruthless in cutting out waste, and tireless in pursuit good value.

But I don't want this recovery money sitting around. I want it to be paid out. I want to see it in the bank accounts of small business because it's got an important job to do. They are the thing that holds a community together.

And because we want to make it easy to claim, we're extending the deadline.

Councils can now pay businesses out of the scheme until the start of January.

So let's build on the good start. Those little firms play a big role in local life. Let's help keep it that way.

And of course, you know the thirty million I've talked about is just the first line of the forms of support on offer.

  * we have also set aside one million to help the meet the cost of putting a roof over the heads of the people made homeless
  * there's support available through the Riot Damages Act
  * there's Bellwin money
  * then there's three million put up by the Wellcome Foundation with the support of the Mayor of London
  * and there's other advice and support for those affected available from a whole host of local charities and national bodies such as the National Retail Consortium.

In fact - I don't think for a second there's any excuse for an iota, a speck, a grain of complacency - but there's a huge and thoroughly heartening surge of activity and goodwill and support.

And I'm not for moment suggesting that there aren't details to iron out - but we have seen the relationship between councils and central government at its best. A proper partnership.

Sir Richard Leese was kind enough to say that ""the Government did listen and have responded very very quickly"".

Well, what can I say, Sir Richard. This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

So now it's time to think ahead.

Back in August, pundits outdid each other to explain the riots.

Some said, blame poverty. Some, parenting. Some, police tactics.

The responsible thing to do, the sensible thing to do, is to take a considered look. To gather all the evidence. To reflect calmly and with proper prospective on how and why the riots happened.

Not in order to explain them away.

Nothing could justify the actions of those who robbed and stole and intimidated.

But to stop it happening again.

The Prime Minister has asked Darra Singh to chair a panel.

They're looking at why a small minority of people rioted.

How public services reacted.

And what could be done differently next time - and how we can prevent it happening again.

The panel will be giving their interim report to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition next month.

I'm not going to pre-empt their conclusions today.

But I don't think I'm going out on a limb if I make three general remarks.

#### One: councils are at the heart of the solution.

Local Government is the key.

Look at the evidence. 

In Haringey - there were several nights of violence.

In Wolverhampton - it was an afternoon.

In Newcastle - and good for Newcastle - all was absolutely peaceful.

Local circumstances count.

Now I don't think it's councils' fault if trouble visited their streets.

But I do think that councils play a big role in understanding what's happening. Nipping problems in the bud. Reacting swiftly and effectively where they have to.

Your leadership, your actions, your initiative make the difference.

#### Two: it's time to deliver.

Take, for example, problem families.

The majority of the people who have been arrested were already known to the police.

Many are from troubled families - who grow up around crime, unemployment and recklessness, selfish behaviour and think it's a perfectly acceptable way of life.

We know the challenges. We know what works. Getting in early.

Tough and focussed help. Not endless bureaucratic shuffling, and different agencies playing pass the parcel with these families.

You're the people who can make this happen. It's in your power to crack it. To smash those different silos that make up local authorities. To smash those silos that Central Government is so good at telling others to get rid of - from within their own individual departments.

Get it right, and you'll save some money for the public purse. But more importantly you'll be saving lives.

And with the support and challenge from Louise Casey in my Department, that's what has got to happen. Now. As many of you will know, Louise is not a woman who takes on a job unless she knows she can crack it. In that way, she's my kinda gal.

#### Three: if you get this right. If you show just what local government can do. Then that's the best possible case for localism I can imagine.

I would love nothing better than for one of the results of the sad and shameful scenes of August to be a cast-iron demonstration of why it's right to push power out further.

Communities want to see action. They want to see answers.

If you need new powers to get to the roots of the problem - if you need that extra bit of flexibility - just ask.

I can't guarantee we'll deliver it. But I can guarantee we'll listen.

Nothing is off the table.

We're lucky. We have people in this room with real experience of the problem, whatever their political allegiance. We can do something our predecessors couldn't: we can not just manage the problem, but can crack the problem.

So keep listening to your local businesses.

Keep working with local communities.

Keep on delivering.

And make the people you serve proud.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,London,,,,27-Oct-2011,improving-high-streets-and-town-centres,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/herefordshire2020,Herefordshire: a vision for the county,"* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

A friend of mine, a senator from Wisconsin, once said 'if you don't like the folks, don't be in our business'.

So on my first day in this job I made clear that this Government would be all about the folks.

I remember walking into the Department. The entire building is out there, right up into the atriums, a very fine looking lot of civil servants all politely applauding.

I told them my top three priorities in Government; Localism, Localism, Localism.

Localism is the principle, the mantra that has defined everything we have done in Government so far.

It's your opportunity as leaders, as businesses, as members of the community to seize these unprecedented opportunities.

To use your initiative, and run ahead with the powers that we are giving you.

To grow, develop, invest and shape the future of the area.

### The Localism Act

This time Government is not snapping at your ankles, nor pulling at the leash, telling you how and when.

We are right beside you - helping to create the conditions in which positive change, change that you decide, happens.

And creating the right conditions for growth is key to that.

Not least because localism and growth are two sides of the same coin.

Growth requires ambitious and forward thinking leaders and communities.

Localism requires ambitious and forward thinking leaders and communities too.

Now my department isn't just the localist department it's the local growth department too.

Localism will support growth. And growth will support localism.

You can now grow at your own pace, match your own ambitions, finance your own projects.

And the Localism Act lets you do exactly that.

### General power of competence

You can't expect to manufacture growth.

You can't expect to boost local business.

You can't expect enterprise to reach its true potential if local councils are restrained from acting in the best interest of the local area.

It's like having fine thoroughbred racing horses all lined up at the starting line raring to go and the gates just won't open.

By handing powers to councils we are opening these gates.

Enabling them to act creatively and innovatively to improve services, drive down costs and enhance their local area.

That's what the general power of competence does for councils.

It doesn't just help with Town Hall prayers, as important as that freedom and liberty is.

The power allows councils to do, within reason, whatever they think is best for their local area without being held up waiting for the go ahead from the centre.

It is at your disposal right now so use it.

### Planning reform

In planning we've lifted the anchor of control, bureaucracy and red tape that was once a drag on growth.

We have scrapped irrelevant regional strategies and housing targets, abolished unaccountable regional development agencies. And given control back to local people.

Reforms to the planning system are making way not just for growth in any old place. But responsible, careful, sustainable development that's right for the local community.

Neighbourhood planning allows people to come together and make decisions about their future.

Such as where new homes and offices should go, and what they should look like.

We are giving people real choice.

And making sure that with that real choice comes real responsibility.

Councils, communities and businesses who say ""yes"" to growth should feel the benefits of that growth.

People respond to the carrot rather than the stick.

The New Homes Bonus and the reformed Community Infrastructure Levy put real cash in the hands of the places who host development.

Our reforms to business rates are rewarding places that grow.

We have given the flexibility for councils to offer business rate discounts - to help attract firms, investment and jobs.

This is the essence of the Local Government Finance Bill.

We want to let councils feel the benefits of supporting the economy.

Rather than giving councils reasons to talk their successes down, we want to give every possible encouragement to secure private sector growth.

This isn't simply about redistributing a pot of money in a new way.

It's about creating the right conditions to make that pot bigger, to boost growth overall.

Those councils that do the most to encourage and enable firms to succeed will see the fruits of their labours.

It just provides an even stronger reason to work in partnership.

### Community rights

Councils and businesses working together is all well and good but it means nothing if you leave communities dragging on the coattails.

Growth can only happen when everyone is on board.

Rather than just taking communities with us we are putting communities in the driving seat.

I've already mentioned Neighbourhood planning.

The new suite of community rights is another way in which we are putting local people at the forefront of change in their local area.

Giving them the right to take over their treasured assets, to bid to run local services. To shape a vision for their future rather than be dictated to.

### Local economies

You can't think about the success and growth of a local area without thinking about the local economy.

We don't presume to know better than the local leaders and businesses what the local economy needs.

You, as the people who have spearheaded business in the area, are the experts.

Instead of imposing structures from the top down, we've asked local businesses and councils to come together.

And instead of entrusting our economic future solely to officials, we want business and enterprise to take their rightful place.

Not just consulted. Not just informed. But involved and leading on the big decisions.

This is the essence of Local Enterprise Partnerships.

I am pleased to say that Local Enterprise Partnerships now cover the whole of the country.

Epsom and Newell District have formally written to request that they become part of the Coast to Capital Partnership, meaning that every local authority are in England is now part of a Local Enterprise Partnership.

And a Local Enterprise Partnership is what you make it.

It's like a clothes horse - on which you can hang whichever elements suit local conditions best.

It's as tame as you want it to be… or as ambitious.

Instead of being stuck in a room with detached bureaucrats negotiating for government approval - filling in endless forms for one size fits all funds that don't really suit your area's needs …

Localists like yourselves can now be in a room of your own choosing.

A room that includes local businessmen and local entrepreneurs.

A room where you make real decisions, with real impacts, about what to do and when to go for it.

It's important to remember this - that these partnerships are not Government bodies, they are local partnerships. It is not up to us what they do, it's up to you.

We are very happy to support partnership's activities and to hear where we can provide help, but what you do is up to you.

Take the half a billion Growing Places Fund.

We put cash on the table with the simplest of applications and instructions.

We said to Local Enterprise Partnerships you decide what infrastructure to spend it on. Your local priorities will be our national priorities.

It's encouraging to see that the Marches Local Enterprise Partnership is taking this on.

The partnership has five and half million to put towards getting housing and growth going.

It is working hard to set the criteria that will be used to make decisions - local criteria, not central rules.

If it's invested wisely, then it will produce returns that can be used again on other projects, continuing growth and local improvements

### Enterprise Zone

The partnership has also secured an Enterprise Zone - which will be a hot house for growth.

The competition for Enterprise Zones was tough.

But the Marches delivered. Putting in a convincing proposal that demonstrated commitment and ability to deliver.

In fact, the Enterprise Zone has already been so successful in attracting interest from investors that the Chancellor has agreed that it should be expanded by an extra eight hectares, to provide additional space for new businesses and more jobs.

While the Enterprise Zone is in Hereford, it provides opportunities over a much wider area.

The more businesses you attract, the more business rates you have to pump back into the future development and growth for the Local Enterprise Partnership - complementing the investment of the Growing Places Fund perhaps?

Then there is the learning.

The experience of having developed a site and made it attractive to investors, creating buzz so that people want to be there.

There's no reason why this can't be replicated in other places.

And so I'm really pleased to hear that the Local Enterprise Partnership is supporting 'Enterprise Areas' in Shrewsbury and Telford.

This is what I was saying before - it's up to you to take the initiative - the Local Enterprise Partnership, the business boards, the councils and the communities.

It's great to see that happen.

### Conclusion

I'm pleased that you're having this event today - it shows Herefordshire is a 'can do' county.

Where local leaders are thinking differently;

  * leading the way
  * seizing the opportunities
  * taking the initiative
  * spotting obstacles and taking them down
  * not waiting for instructions

It these new approaches, revolutionary ways of thinking that will be crucial to restoring growth.

So don't look over your shoulder. Take your ideas. Run with them. You have the powers at your disposal.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"The Courtyard Theatre, Hereford",,,,2-Mar-2012,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

I am delighted to have been invited to join you today at the Heritage Champions National Conference, not least so that I can add to Baroness Andrews' eloquent tribute to the Champions.

Your sterling work continues to ensure that the historic environment receives the vital encouragement it deserves within each of your local authorities, and you are a crucial focus for community cohesion throughout our towns, villages and neighbourhoods.

What you do is so much in tune with the Government's philosophy and agenda that, forgive the well-worn cliche, if you didn't exist already, we'd certainly have to invent you.

Baroness Andrews reminded us that the historic environment is not just about Stonehenge, Canterbury Cathedral and the Tower of London. It is about the richness of our heritage in people's houses, factories, streetscapes and landscapes. It's about the town centres where people live, work, shop and spend their leisure time, the rural churches where they worship, and the village halls where they come together in a multitude of local activities.

The historic environment brings us together and enhances our understanding of our past. It is one of the principal drivers of civic activity in communities up and down the country. It is a key part of what makes places special the local distinctiveness that campaign group Common Ground has done so much to promote.

The new edition of Heritage Counts tells us that there are some 485,000 people in England who regularly volunteer on heritage related projects. 93 per cent of people have consistently over the last four years agreed that in any improvement/regeneration projects it is essential to try and save their historic features.

It is increasingly recognised that the time spent improving and enhancing the quality of our streets, houses, villages and towns is a positive investment than can reap rich rewards. It helps to give a proper sense of place and local identity. Often this means caring for and improving a locality or neighbourhood. Concentrating on and including the historic environment making it an attractive place in which people want to live and businesses to set up. In all of this local authorities have a major role to play - in their enthusiasm to maintain both the fabric and evidence of our past.

The rapid emergence of the new national charity for the civic movement, Civic Voice is testament to the strength of interest in and passion for our historic local surroundings. A professional voice is essential to help communities understand and interpret what can often seem complex and impenetrable planning laws and procedures and to make their views heard at the appropriate time and in the right forum.

The Government understands the value of and the key role that communities can play in protecting and enhancing their area. All over the country there are residents and amenity groups who are knowledgeable and dedicated to doing just that. Indeed, we believe there is scope to build on and harness much more of the knowledge and interest that exists in neighbourhoods and communities, and giving them a bigger say in what happens to them. In doing so we will help to build the Big Society.

The Big Society while not a new concept, is one which has been embraced by the Prime Minister and promoted by the coalition government. It is based on a conviction that cohesion and independence comes from decreasing the power of the state and giving back responsibility for their own lives to individuals. That the best can be brought out in communities where people work together. It's about people 'opting in' and not 'opting out'. This is not just empty rhetoric, it is a strong belief in giving people and communities the power and information they need to understand what they can do to work together to address and resolve problems.

There are still too many people who believe they cannot influence local decisions that might have a profound effect on them. Public meetings are often not well attended. Many people have no real sense of how their money is spent locally. They become frustrated or apathetic feeling that the state will always win as they have little control or influence over what happens to them.

The Big Society is a vision to change this and to create a nation of individuals and who feel empowered by knowledge to work together to contribute to influence what happens in their own and their communities affairs. The Government is committed to help by passing power and authority from the centre to the local, generating more organisers, local groups, volunteers and social enterprises within the community. The Localism Bill, which is due soon from my department, the requirement for transparency in publishing expenditure and the commitment we have, will bring this about.

We fully recognise that communities will not be empowered unless they are freed from some of the obstacles that get in the way of their realizing their ambitions and aspirations. The Government therefore is committed to the radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local government and community groups.

The present system is too highly centralised and bureaucratic, and we recognise that that needs to change. I hear the weary sighs of many who say 'how is this different, we have heard all this before and nothing has happened'. Well. the Secretary of State's mantra is localism, localism and localism. That is his and the Government's commitment to this process. Already many of the measures to pass responsibility from the centre are being worked into the Localism Bill which will contain the full details of the decentralisation proposals. Reforms will lift the burden of centralised controls and give local authorities and local people the flexibility to innovate, be creative, access new resources and control their own futures.

To start this we have made it clear that we will revoke Regional Spatial Strategies. Widely disliked, and so complex that only a very few authorities managed to bring them to completion. This will mean removing the top-down targets that have done so much to put unwanted pressure on communities, and put responsibility for assessing the appropriate level of development into the hands of local people.

The Coalition Agreement also promised a radical reform of the planning system, part of which will give neighbourhoods far more ability to determine the shape of the places where they live. At the heart of the proposals is a shift in culture. We want planning to be the aid that communities use to shape their own neighbourhoods, not something that is seen as an undesirable obstacle or an unwelcome intrusion which pits resident against resident.

For the planning system to work it must win the confidence of all those who depend on it, particularly as an alien development lasts for years. We all know of the anxiety caused by proposals for unwelcome and controversial developments, the back extensions which affect the next door neighbours, the large projects which often seem not to have taken into account local peoples objections or fears. It is our belief that when places are properly shaped by the people who live in them, there should be far less room for such controversy, which leads to deterioration in the quality of the places we want to live in, and undermines the system and people's confidence in it.

For planning to be effective and robust at the local level, the national planning framework must be also. National planning policy has grown significantly and now consists of over 7000 pages of policy, circulars and guidance. This complexity makes it inaccessible to professionals, let alone individuals, even those gifted in finding their way round the planning system.

The Government is, therefore, committed to publishing and presenting to Parliament a simple and consolidated national planning framework covering all forms of development and setting out national economic and social priorities.

This is an exercise with which all those involved in the historic environment or with an interest in our heritage will not be unfamiliar. We are very conscious of the work and collaboration that has already gone into the new Planning Policy Statement 5 when it replaced the earlier Planning Policy Guidance Notes on the historic environment and archaeology in March of this year, already referred to by Baroness Andrews. We are aware of the interest the consultation draft provoked, and of the variety - and intensity - of the views that were expressed at the time. The resultant PPS 5 is already a much slimmer and more focused document than its predecessors.

Conservation of the historic environment is dependent on a robust planning system, and we are determined to ensure that we have in place a system that commands respect.

All planning policy will be informed by the Government's proposals for localism, but I can assure you that the importance of the historic environment will not be overlooked in this aspect of the Coalition's programme.

Baroness Andrews referred to the wonderful project at Hebden Bridge Town Hall. This is a very good example of the transfer of heritage assets that are being funded through the Asset Transfer Unit. The Government has supported the Unit to work with over 100 local authorities and community partners around the country to support the transfer of assets to community ownership, including a number of significant heritage buildings.

The Coalition Programme is committed to giving communities new powers to help save local facilities threatened with closure. We will be introducing provisions in the Localism Bill to give effect to this commitment.

As part of our determination to shift power to local neighbourhoods, we will be acting to ensure that community organisations have a fair chance to bid to take over public assets and facilities that are important to them.

These could include their village shop, the last remaining pub in the village, the community centre, children's centre a library, a redundant church or a derelict site that could be transformed into a community hub for their neighbourhood or town. Proposals for this are still be finalized but will be ready for the forthcoming legislation.

The Government has already announced the formation of Local Enterprise Partnerships - which will be genuine business-civic partnerships of local authorities, business groups, voluntary and other local organisations, chaired by a leading business person in their area.

These will take over most of the responsibilities of the regional development agencies, though in general they will cover a much smaller area. They will be tasked with taking the strategic lead and creating the conditions for economic and private sector growth in their area. The first 24 partnerships were recently given the go-ahead.

Heritage and culture can play a large role in supporting economic growth and regeneration, and many of the emerging partnerships such as Liverpool City Region have identified these as key priorities.

All these initiatives present opportunities for action and participation at the local level. Some of the challenges they present are longstanding ones, such as that of heritage assets at risk either through lack of resources or deliberate neglect.

There is, however, increasing recognition of the contribution that the historic environment can make, and plans and decisions taken at the local level will be of crucial importance in helping to address what is a national problem.

You will, I am sure, understand I am not able today to reveal precise details of all the Government's proposals, particularly those that will appear in the Localism Bill. But I hope I have said enough to indicate clearly the direction of the Government's thinking and that you particularly the Heritage Champions that are here today - will be encouraged and energised to continue to be an integral part of the preservation of our historic heritage.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

In recent years you had an ever changing parade of Housing Ministers addressing you.

Even though the faces changed the message remained the same.

You were told again and again to build more homes.

Targets were set.

Taxpayers' money was pumped into schemes.

And what happened?

We ended up building fewer homes than even during the Great Depression.

In opposition I set out a different approach - scrapping top down targets, and giving people the tools to get Britain building again.

As Shadow Housing Minister in 2008, I outlined how we would place incentives at the heart of our policy - the New Homes Bonus.

Some of you were sceptical.

Some of you probably still are.

But even the sceptics knew things had to change.

So in power we've moved swiftly...

### New Homes Bonus

Within a year of being in Government, Local Authorities have already received the first of six years worth of New Homes Bonus cash.

I have been receiving letters from councils all over the country welcoming that money and telling me how it has started to change local opinion, among councillors and communities on the ground, to back more growth.

Incentives will deliver what people want in their neighbourhoods - bringing the benefits of new homes to the wider community.

That will be welcome news to you.

After all building homes is how you make your living.

It's how your companies are profitable.

It's how you grow your businesses.

And it's how you create jobs.

What you need is to be free, free to build.

What we need is a housing market that really works.

A market driven by those incentives...

...freed from over-centralised planning.

A market liberated from unnecessary burdens and over-zealous regulations.

Bluntly, we need the housing market to work - but as Stewart Baseley suggested, to get this country back on its feet, and you can be part of this important process.

### Economic Growth

Because getting house-building going is essential to increasing the pace of economic growth.

So having acted to cut the deficit to prevent us looking like the Greek, Irish or Portuguese economies...this Government is now going for growth.

In the Budget we introduced the FirstBuy scheme to help over 10,000 struggling First Time Buyers this year and next. Resource has also been given to Scotland, so across the UK.

We are scrapping the unfavourable Stamp Duty treatment for bulk purchases of new homes to encourage greater equity investment.

And we announced that we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land.

My 'Build Now, Pay Later' scheme quite literally means that you'll be able to build homes and sell them, and only then pay for the land.

And we've made an historic commitment to reduce burdens on the house-building industry by March 2015.

I'd previously asked you in this room, the industry, to tell me which bits of red-tape were tying you in knots.

I've got that list and I'm gradually working my way through it.

But I don't want to see new bureaucracy get in the way either.

You might recall that there was some talk about a ""Local Standards Framework"" that was recently floated - the idea being that Local Authorities could decide what standards to apply to new homes, from a pre-agreed ""menu""/list of different choices.

You've been discussing these ideas with Government.

There are fears that devolving control to Local Authorities may actually increase regulation.

Interestingly, councils aren't that keen either.

So I can tell you now that I don't propose pushing forward with the ""Local Standards Framework"".

Instead it will be for the industry, Local Authorities and Government to work together to find the right solutions.

Because I can tell you one thing for certain - today is the day when the Government piling on the regulations are over.

Because I know that the cumulative impact of bureaucracy, regulations and red-tape simply erodes viability.

### Sustainable Development

But I want to go much further than just banishing building bureaucracy.

The Plan for Growth published alongside the Budget this year made it clear we will be a Pro-Sustainable Development Government.

And we'll shortly be publishing a presumption in favour of sustainable development in the new National Planning Policy Framework.

Now this is a document that will take over one thousand pages of Planning Law and a further six thousand pages of Guidance (much of it as you know contradictory) and replace the whole lot with one simple, short document!

No more PPS's. No more PPG's.

The Framework will be strong where it needs to be. It will have policies that support the Government's priorities for economic growth.

Almost all the recommendations from the Killian Pretty report have now been implemented and the Plan for Growth reiterated our commitment to taking forward the findings of the Penfold review.

But I still want to go further, for example.

We're consulting on allowing easier conversion of empty office buildings to homes.

And as you know, we're abolishing the regional tier of the planning system and simplifying the planning application process.

But I know it's not just about getting the right planning decisions - speed counts too for your business.

So we are introducing a 12-month Planning Guarantee - to ensure that bureaucracy doesn't get in the way of business.

### Zero Carbon

We'll shortly announce final details on the definition for Zero Carbon homes.

This will be an historic moment in our drive forward to slash carbon emissions and tackle climate change.

And we'll do it without piling unfair costs on housebuilders.

It will be practical, workable and green.

Homes will be built to zero carbon.

Not just in design, but in reality - they way that they function!

But we're not trying to have you second guess how many Plasma TVs the home owner decides to hang on their wall.

And, in any case, that's already covered by other EU Carbon trading rules.

### Conclusion

So this Government is committed to planning reform...to sustainable development...and to reducing regulation.

And whereas in Whitehall we have an overall One In... One Out policy - that's to say before you can introduce regulation, you have to remove something else first.

I want to do even better than that for the building industry.

So carry on bringing me your red tape and I'll absolutely delight in tasking my officials to slash that tape.

This is a continuing process - not a one-off exercise.

I will continue listen to your concerns and free you to do your job.

And together, I hope we can build the homes this country so desperately needs.

Thank you.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"Marriott Grosvenor Square Hotel, London",,,,10-May-2011,providing-effective-building-regulations-so-that-new-and-altered-buildings-are-safe-accessible-and-efficient,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

Britain is a growing society.

The number of households is set to keep on rising in the years to come.

The average age of first-time buyers is already creeping steadily upwards.

The number of people under 30 buying without parental help has fallen 90 per cent since 2006.

Though young people's desire to own is as strong as ever.

And as the Budget made clear, housing has a vital role in driving up economic growth.

So let me be entirely explicit. Britain needs more homes.

A year ago, some had their doubts.

I said we would abolish housing targets.

They asked - how would we guarantee that the homes we need nationally would get built?

But in 2009, despite housing targets, the rate of housebuilding hit its lowest point in peacetime in over 80 years.

To put that in perspective:

  * In 1926, year of the General Strike, the country built more homes.
  * In 1947, with rationing, fuel shortages and a run on the pound, the country built more homes.
  * And in 1979, when the rubbish was piling up in the street, the country still built more homes.
  * So, I have no qualms about cutting away red tape if it isn't doing its job.

Housing is the most market-oriented of all my Department's responsibilities.

Policy should go with the grain of the market. Not against it.

Hence, in those first few months, we also said goodbye to centrally-set density targets.

And farewell to home information packs.

Deregulating is the first thing we sought to do.

But - it is by no means the last.

And over these months we have worked closely with you - building on the work begun in opposition - fine-tuning our approach - thinking about the barriers to growth, and how we can remove them.

### Localism for growth

At heart, we're seeking to change the mindset about development.

There's a common misconception. That localism is the enemy of growth.

But quite the opposite is true.

A high-handed approach to development is a recipe for unhappiness.

Look at the level of anger and resistance to Regional Spatial Strategies.

Look at the results. ""Take it or leave it"" doesn't build any houses.

And localism isn't just a transfer of power. It's also a transfer of responsibility and a transfer of the consequences for indecision.

Some local decision-makers saw national targets as an excuse to wash their hands. And avoid difficult local debates.

The result: in too many places, planning decisions are made by appeal.

That's just not healthy.

By contrast, giving people choice, a chance to influence proposals at an early stage, a way to put forward their own ideas:

All make it easier to have that proper debate.

And as clever developers have found, to reach consensus early on.

And to put an end to planning decisions based on cowardice and indecision, leading to costly and rancorous appeals.

That's why neighbourhood planning isn't a bar to development, but one of the measures to unlock it.

That's why we'll continue to challenge and support you to work with communities to get the right standards of design. Because when people are happy about the look and feel of new development they are more likely to say yes.

And it's why the duty we are introducing on developers, to consult with local communities before making an application for large-scale projects, is nothing to be afraid of.

The best do this already.

They know that in the long term their best interests are served by spending more time with the locals, than with the lawyers.

But we aren't simply creating the opportunities for debate and discussion.

We are putting the right incentives in place to ensure that those places which choose to grow are recognised and supported.

The New Homes Bonus will bring roughly £9,000 for an average Band D property, over six years, for each additional home built.

Cash the council can reinvest in local priorities.

Meanwhile, our reforms to the Community Infrastructure Levy will mean the people closest to new development get extra support to adapt to change.

And a direct say in what they want to see happen. Whether it's refurbishing the community hall. Or resurfacing the roads.

So if you live round the corner from the new estate, you don't just feel the cost. You see the benefits.

Together, the New Home Bonus and the Levy represent reasons for local people to say ""yes"" to development.

They show localism firmly set on the side of growth.

### Making planning work better

At the same time, we're making wider changes to make the planning system better at doing the job it's designed to: That is, to bring forward the development the country needs, in the right place, at the right time, and to the right standards.

Not to frustrate and delay.

We're aiming to condense over a hundred pieces of separate planning policy, guidance, and circulars into a single, clear, easy to understand document.

A new national planning policy framework was one of the first things we got started working on when we first came into office.

At its heart will be a presumption in favour of sustainable development.

It's a change in the default expectation.

If a proposal meets the right measures of sustainability, including environmental standards - it should go ahead.

We're calling on councils to be realistic in the way they use the planning system.

It's fair for councils to ask developers to agree a contribution to the area where they're planning to build, so that their development is sustainable.

Perhaps providing a new park or playground.

But what looked like a reasonable request three or four years ago may no longer look quite so reasonable today.

Especially if it stops necessary development happening altogether.

Councils should not of course compromise on the essentials necessary to make a development acceptable to local communities.

But I am calling on them to review agreements to get development moving again, and quickly.

As the Housing Minister Grant Shapps made clear this morning, other public bodies have a role to play in making building possible too.

Opening up their surplus land for development.

The six sites announced by the Homes and Communities Agency today should be the first of many.

And we're cutting out unnecessary red tape.

Streamlining planning applications and consents regimes.

Removing bureaucracy to speed up the system.  
And beginning a consultation on reform of use class orders.

To get rid of a bar on turning old commercial buildings into new residential properties.

If communities want to see unoccupied eyesores become much-needed new homes, then the planning system shouldn't stand in the way.

### Proportionate, priority-based regulation to ensure quality

This is in line with our commitment to creating a more proportionate, more targeted approach to regulation.

We nailed our colours to the mast at the Comprehensive Spending Review - committing to deliver an overall reduction in the cost of regulation that you face by 2015.

We took immediate action.

Dropped proposed standards for publicly funded housing.

Binned additional requirements on homes built on public land.

And asked you to send in your suggestions for unnecessary requirements or bureaucracy that we could get rid of.

We've listened carefully, and the Housing Minister will be responding shortly.

And where it's right and necessary to regulate, we want to do so in a way that's proportionate and effective.

Take zero carbon standards.

The proposals that were on the table when we came in would have made builders responsible for the appliances used by people living in the homes they built.

Hairdryers. Plasma TVs. Xboxes.

That's not your responsibility. It's theirs.

We are asking you only to take responsibility for the things you do and should control - the energy efficiency measures, the heating and hot water systems, the building services.

And we are giving you flexibility on how you do it.

In other words - we're cutting costs, but not our commitment to the environment.

Now it's up to you to match our flexibility by being inventive and innovative. Making new homes greener than ever.

### Mortgage availability and first time buyers

We also recognise that a tight mortgage market is a major barrier to housing growth now.

That's why we've been working closely with the developers, regulators and lenders to get the conditions in the mortgage market right.

And it's why the Budget gave a commitment to support first-time buyers, who are the lifeblood of the housing market.

I well remember buying my first home. The sense of ownership, pride and independence.

I want more young families to be able to experience that.

Not the frustration of being stuck in cramped, unsuitable accommodation.

Nor having to rely on the bank of mum and dad for a deposit.

That is if mum and dad are lucky enough to be able to afford it.

So, we're introducing a new form of support that will help first-time buyers get a foot on the ladder.

A 20 per cent equity loan, co-funded by government and developers.

Putting ownership in the grasp of 10,000 first-time buyers over the next two years.

The industry asked for this before the Budget - you got it.

The Budget also set out two measures which will reduce the industry's reliance on mortgage finance.

You asked a reform of stamp duty land tax rules on bulk purchases of residential property.

In the past, an investor buying 10 flats worth £200,000 each would have paid stamp duty on the total - some £100,000.

In the future they'll pay stamp duty on the average price of the properties - only £20,000.

The Budget also committed to removing barriers to investment in Real Estate Investment Trusts. Another means of attracting much needed equity investment. The investment you need to have the confidence to build.

### Challenge

So the next step is simple.

Just think why you're here and why you got involved in the first place.

Making homes that last a lifetime.

Places you're so proud of you want to take your friends and families to see them.

Now we're asking you to work in a slightly different way from recent years.

Relying not on the wiliness of your lawyers, but on the strength of your relationships with local communities.

Don't worry too much. Your planning silk won't need to get a paper round.

Though they might have to wait a few more weeks for the Tuscan holiday and a little longer before buying that Maserati.

But at heart your job is the same as it ever was.

Building not just houses, but places people are proud to call home.

Turning great ideas on paper into bricks and mortar.

Into neighbourhoods where people are happy to raise their children.

And into homes that people leave in the morning ready to meet the day, and that they are glad to come home to at night.

It's an awesome responsibility. I know you are up to the challenge.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Savoy Place, London",,,,31-Mar-2011,providing-effective-building-regulations-so-that-new-and-altered-buildings-are-safe-accessible-and-efficient,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

This Government came to office with a wholly new approach to housing.  We didn't want to tweak existing policies.  Nor to do a bit of tinkering here and there.

We want to get Britain building again. We want the new homes a growing country needs. The homes that growing families, older people, and young mobile professionals need. We'll do it by working with the market. Not against it.

Localism means a whole new approach to incentives and investment. Giving communities genuine choice to shape and influence growth - not forcing development upon them. Supporting communities to deal with the impacts of growth - not leaving them high and dry.

The New Homes Bonus and the amended Community Infrastructure Levy gives growing neighbourhoods cash to invest locally. We want to communities to have good reasons to say ""yes"" to growth. If we look at the experience in Netherlands and Germany, I think it's very plain that localism and growth are two sides of the same coin.

A year ago, at this very same conference, I suspect some of you had doubts. You had seen us remove the Regional Spatial Strategies and asked - what's next?

But a year on we have delivered on our commitments:

  * The New Homes Bonus - the first payments have already been made.
  * We have brought forward the Localism Bill. It's very close now to getting royal assent.  It spells the end of regional strategies and an important start on neighbourhood planning.
  * We have begun consulting on a change to Use Class Orders, which would make it easier to turn old, empty offices into homes.
  * We have confirmed four point five billion pounds' worth of investment in affordable housing.
  * We have been working with lenders to unlock the mortgage market.
  * In the Budget we confirmed the FirstBuy scheme would help ten and a half thousand first-time buyers get a foot on the ladder.
  * And we are consulting on a new draft planning policy framework, which has, at its heart, a presumption in favour of sustainable development.

Planning needs to be positive.  It needs to help and seek out and deliver responsible, careful development that the country needs.

You kind of know it's time for reform when planning costs have grown at the same time as the number of applications has fallen; when delays cost the economy around three billion pounds each year; and when planning restrictions mean that office space is more expensive in Manchester and Birmingham than in Manhattan.

My speech now contains a brilliant piece of civil service understatement: the consultation has started a lively debate.  If you want to have your say, now's the time.

So I welcome the fact that Property Week have spoken up. Good for you in bringing some balance. By saying that growth can be good. That properly planned development is a benefit, not a burden. That good design makes places that stand the test of time.

It's not just houses, but places that people are proud to call home. In communities that work. In easy reach of jobs and schools and doctors and shops and libraries and leisure centres. Good planning makes good communities happen. Taking all of Government's different reforms together - we've created a platform; we've put in place the right incentives and investment. And we're just beginning to see the first fruits.

Thanks to your rapid response, the first FirstBuy allocations were announced in June, just three months after we announced the competition. And already, the first homeowners are putting their feet under the table in their homes. Housebuilders and social landlords have risen to the challenge of the new Affordable Rent models and have - quite frankly - exceeded our expectations. We thought that we would be able to provide one hundred and fifty thousand affordable homes by 2015.  Now, thanks to the quality of the proposals we estimate that we could deliver up to one hundred and seventy thousand.

And although conditions are still tough, the average deposit that's required from first time buyers has decreased.

I want you to have the confidence to plan ahead and to make the most of the opportunities our approach gives you. There are three key things to bear in mind.

First, localism is here to stay. No developer can rely on strong-arming, on housing targets to get their development built. The best already know that if they work with people, if they work with communities and get into proper partnerships they will build something that everyone will be proud of. If you are able to listen to local communities, you'll be able to give them what they want and they're more likely to say yes. In places like South Gate in Totnes, developers have listened hard to local people to design new homes in line with what they want. In Fish Quay in North Shields, residents are getting together to say what they think the future of their hometown should be.

So if the community tells you they want family homes with gardens - build family homes with gardens. They would like to see better  quality materials and good design - work those in to your plans.  Listen to local people and you will be able to unlock growth.  When our reforms truly bite, developers who aren't taling local communities' views into account risk falling behind.

Second, lenders have a key role to play in driving growth. There's no point in building if no-one's buying. We know that there is still a burning desire among young people to own their own home. I can remember the enormous sense of pride and ownership when I first bought. Even with the modest drop in deposits, it's still tough out there. Including for people with good jobs and steady incomes.

It's time for mortgages to come in all shapes and sizes. I think there are some encouraging signs, with innovation in the market.  Chelsea have brought forward a 10-year fixed-rate loan. Mates' mortgages are still on the market. Some lenders and investors are thinking about shared equity mortgages backed by social capital. You lend to help a stranger buy, and take a share in their property. I want to see much more innovation like this.

Third - owning a home will continue to be the ambition and the reality for the majority of Britons.  But we need a high-quality private rented sector too, offering flexibility and a choice. And if institutional investment in homes to rent supports growth, and creates jobs, anybody in their right mind will be in favour.

That's why we have changed the stamp duty land tax treatment for bulk purchases of homes. Institutional investors no longer face a penalty. We're consulting on measures to make it easier to run Real Estate Investment Trusts. Canny housebuilders will be thinking hard about the potential of the private rented sector. For example, many of you sell homes to Buy to Let investors. This is important. But few of you commission, design and build for longer term large scale investment and management. And perhaps there is some scope for this in the future.

We've got a foundation today, a basis to get Britain building again. We will continue to create the right conditions for you. This autumn we will be publishing a housing strategy, so you can see what we're doing in one place and plan ahead with confidence.

Housing could not be more important. It's a key way of boosting the economy. But I think it's also so much more. 

Your job, my job is to create places that people can call home with a sense of pride. Creating homes, not simply places where people sleep between commutes.

I suspect that's why you got into this industry. I bet you wanted to improve the quality of life of families today and for generations to come. Build the kinds of places that, years down the line, you'd want to take a detour to see. See how the gardens are bedding in; see what it feels like; see the families making their lives there. This should be about making people's lives better.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

### Introduction

Thank you Gareth [Capner] for that introduction and whilst I'm at it I'd also like to thank David [Birkbeck] for organising this event.

I know that some of you are on tenterhooks to see who will receive the award for the overall winner. I promise I will keep this short but a little bit more anticipation may well sweeten the prize.

### Importance of design

When I was shadow housing minister I asked RIBA to host a speech I made to stress the importance I place on design. Of course many of you have been calling for a greater emphasis on design for **all** of your professional lives. Organisations like RIBA, and CABE have supported you and others in making the case to the previous Government. And progress has been made. These awards demonstrate that.

I wanted to come today to emphasise that the new Government sees design as a key priority.

The very first visit I chose to make as Minister for Housing and Local Government was to start a new development called the Triangle in Swindon. A development by TV's Kevin McCloud. I wanted to send a strong signal that even in these **straitened times**… we still need **grand designs**. I am pleased to see that the judges of these awards were as impressed as me.

The very best is on show here today. And as I have travelled the country as Shadow Housing Minister over the past few years I have visited countless examples of inspiring design.

### Costs

Great design lifts the spirit and doesn't need to cost the earth - in **both** senses!

I am impressed by the way in which the industry has responded to new challenges of climate change.

But I also know that good design doesn't have to cost the earth. [Political content removed]. Many of you have already been squeezing budgets and doing more for less. And you and I know that great design is inexpensive compared to overall project budgets. It is not solely a matter of how much is spent on design… it's whether it's **good** or **bad**.

### Community

And yet despite all the positive developments, I still don't think enough is always done to make sure that it's the community which feels the benefit. Read my speech to RIBA to find out about my experiences in Brent as a young politician canvassing residents in some disgusting tower blocks. They had been built as **heaven in the sky** - but had become **hell on earth**.

Frankly, too many of our fellow citizens are condemned to live in the broken dreams of your predecessors. Places built with the very best of intentions but resulting in the very worst for residents. Lessons have been learnt and I know that you share my enthusiasm for change.

How?

Well together, we will give people power to make decisions about their own communities. Rather than being told what will be built and where… residents of villages, towns and cities will be able to develop their own communities. We will replace central targets with powerful financial incentives that will mean people will better welcome homes in their communities.

I'm going to release control - and when I do, I know an extraordinary thing will happen….

Rather than resist being told what to build and where… people will begin to embrace new developments. They'll seize the opportunity provided by our plans which include Local Housing Trusts - meaning that rural areas can actually grant themselves planning permission, where there is overwhelming local support.

And they will demand that these new homes are well designed. And when that works… the community will want to give designers and architects prizes for having improved their quality of life.

### Conclusion

And today, I'd like to give out an award to…

But before I announce the overall winner I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who have worked so hard on all of the schemes that have been recognised today. I am particularly pleased that respect for community was a key feature of many of this year's winners and in particular the overall winner. This meant that the existing local community was at peace with the new one. And people welcomed the exceptional design of the 400 new homes.

The design, part of a larger development, evolved through community workshops. A model of the way that we see good design and community involvement working in the future.

I am pleased to announce that the overall winner is… Icon in Street, Somerset.

Please come and collect your award - Well done!",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"The Banqueting House, Whitehall",,,,8-Jul-2010,,,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

### Introduction

What would an intelligent Housing Market look like?

Quite simply, it would be a market that met people's aspirations:

Maybe to buy their own home;

Or to live close to their family and friends;

Or to move to find work.

That's not the market we've inherited.

By presiding over a system which saw house prices double in just ten years, the last Government ensured that buying a home was out of the question for the vast majority of wannabe first time buyers.

With a house now liable to cost perhaps seven times someone's earnings, it's no surprise that the average unsupported first time buyer is 37 years old.

This country is in danger of letting down the aspirations of yet another generation if homes do not become more affordable in the long term.

### House price stability

So what is required now is a period of house price stability.

House price booms keep people out of the market.

And house price busts mean people's homes are worth less than they paid for them.

It's a market where today's expert tells you to ""hold on folks, cos prices are gonna fall"".

But don't be surprised if tomorrow's expert tells you that ""now's the time to buy to make a killing"" as house prices resume their upwards march.

It might even be the same expert! It will definitely be from the same newspaper!

Now I'm fully aware of the dangers of talking about the end of boom and bust.

But I think we need a market that's, well, boring. Where things are really quite predictable.

Where the pressure of making what could be the single biggest financial decision of your life, is based on your needs and desires, not on whether you feel lucky.

Buying a home shouldn't be like playing the lottery.

Sometimes it seems like we've all forgotten what our housing market is actually for.

To provide a roof over our heads.

A home where we feel safe, comfortable and happy.

Somewhere we can bring up our family or live alone.

I have a simple ambition.

An ambition for a period of house price stability.

This would provide a stable business environment for the building industry.

A market that means the industry can contribute to a sustainable economic recovery.

Of course I understand that market conditions don't exactly match this picture at the moment.

The economic legacy we inherited has made things very, very difficult for you and will do so for sometime.

### Cutting the deficit

But we must look at the bigger picture and cut the public deficit.

We will abolish the structural deficit in this Parliament and we plan to make rapid progress towards that goal.

And in case you think deficit reduction is all pain and no gain you should ask Martin Lewis, the money savings expert. He pointed out yesterday that the cost of tracker mortgages fell to a record low during September as competition continued to return to the market, because deficit reduction promotes lower interest rates.

So it's really important that we keep interest rates low and improve credit availability for first time buyers, house movers, landlords and yes, housebuilders.

Cutting the deficit not only creates the right conditions for banks to lend to prospective home-buyers, but also better terms for housebuilders.

As a business man I know the personal investment and the hard work that makes for success.

And I wouldn't want that success to be threatened by interest rates rising quickly.

And, yes, the need to address the deficit means that the level of public expenditure will diminish.

This audience already knows that.

You know that the old assumptions have gone and if you are still in any doubt you will only have to wait til next week.

### Targets

You didn't have to wait that long for us to scrap housebuilding targets.

Of course we must build more homes.

The 'demographic imperative' demands it.

But attempting to impose supply on local communities from the centre failed you, and failed those communities.

It makes a good headline to say that the abolition of targets has meant X fewer homes being built.

But it's a lazy headline

Because the numbers just don't stack up.

It's a false comparison - the targeted number of homes was simply never going to get built.

The communities they were imposed on were already making sure of that through judicial reviews, and being very vocal in their opposition.

Targets actually set neighbourhoods against development.

All the community saw was central Government imposing, and the community fought back.

### Incentives

Instead what neighbourhoods need are incentives to accept new homes.

And that's where the powerful New Homes Bonus kicks in.

Communities could see reductions in council tax, or a redeveloped town centre or a new community centre in compensation for accepting new homes.

When the previous Government imposed a 10 000 home target in my constituency I led the No Way to 10 K campaign.

Revealingly all the political parties joined in.

Frankly, they had no alternative if they wanted to genuinely represent their community.

But what if the communities could see the benefit?

If the regeneration of Hatfield's tired town centre could be paid for through the New Homes Bonus?

It would transform that debate.

Incentives will be a powerful driver of an intelligent market.

But for the private sector to respond to that driver it must be set free from unnecessary regulation.

### Complexity of regulation

So as we cut public expenditure, we will also cut state interference.

As you know HIPs are already history, for example.

Today I can announce I am intent on further reducing the burden of regulation.

I will make sure any regulation must be cost-effective and proportionate - driving down unnecessary expense.

You will have heard this before, but the difference is that we really mean it.

Just as we are serious about cutting the deficit, we are serious about reducing regulations.

Of course, Building Regulations will continue to set a national minimum requirement for all new homes to make sure they are safe and help us reach our climate change targets.

But we have already launched a review of the Building Regulations to identify where we can ease the burden on industry.

I know that Building Regs are not the only burdens: over time, the housebuilding industry has been asked to deal with a growing number of additional standards.

CABE have produced a simple diagram to explain how the various regulations, codes and standards relate to each other.

Of course this audience understands this diagram perfectly!

But to others it is a complex web of duplication, contradictory requirements, multiple points of assessment and compliance.

We will work hard to reduce this burden but we will need your help.

### Commitment to reduce burden

I applaud the constructive way you are engaging with us to meet the zero carbon challenge.

Many of you will be working with the Zero Carbon Hub to test the appropriate carbon compliance level.

We are exploring the option for developers to meet further obligations through payments to fund local energy projects.

I will want to consider carefully the costs and benefits of continuing to have different standards for social and market housing.

I can also promise that we will keep planning requirements to a minimum.

Reducing the truckloads of paperwork required for a planning application.

There will be no more mad dash to hire a three ton truck to deliver planning documents as the deadline draws near.

### Conclusion

Because what we want is a market where councils and housebuilders are free to act in the interest of local communities.

We will reduce the burden of regulation.

We will provide a powerful incentive that works.

We will free communities to demand that you build more homes.

We will do our bit.

In return we want you to do your bit.

To get out there and sell the benefits of new homes.

Not just to prospective home buyers but to the whole community, through the New Homes Bonus.

To make the market more intelligent the existing population must see the benefit of new homes.

Show them what the incentive can buy - what they can get for their money.

Together we can make localism work.

Together we can create the intelligent market we all want.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Unfortunately, the Fire Minister is unable to be here today. I will deliver his speech as prepared for him.

Thank you for inviting to speak today, and I am sorry not to be able to attend in person to hear the wider discussion and debate.

Ensuring an acceptable level of fire safety in all residential premises is clearly a matter of great concern to us all. I am therefore delighted to see that both the housing and fire sector have come together to arrange this important seminar, and that we have good representation from both sectors.

As you will be aware from today's discussions, there is a significant amount of positive work going on in the housing and fire sector to help protect people from fire.

### Better Regulation

Before going into this in detail, I thought it would be helpful to set out the context in which the Coalition Government is determined to act in the future.

We believe the current legislative framework strikes the right balance in terms of affording an appropriate level of protection to residents in the wide range of buildings in which they live. Landlords, building owners and others with responsibilities for ensuring the safety of multi-occupied residential buildings have clear responsibilities for minimising fire risks under both the Housing Health and Safety Rating System and the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, which applies to common parts.

We believe that good regulation - that which is well designed, proportionate and ensures that proper standards are in place to deliver public assurance over safety - is a good thing. We will not unnecessarily seek to remove it, where it has a clear justification.

Of course, good regulation serves to protect us all: consumers, employees and the environment. It helps build a fair society and can even save lives. But over the years, regulations - and the inspections and bureaucracy that go with them - have piled up and up. This has hurt business, imposing real burdens and doing real damage to our economy.

Reducing the number of rules and regulations is therefore absolutely central to the Coalition Government's vision for Britain, removing barriers to economic growth and increasing individual freedoms. We have given a clear commitment that where regulation cannot be justified, we will remove it. With more than 21,000 regulations impacting on businesses and others in the UK today, this won't be an easy task - but we're determined to cut unnecessary red tape.

The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 is a good example of where we believe real success has already been delivered. Before 2006, there were over 70 fire safety-related Acts of Parliament and numerous statutory instruments in place, many of which overlapped. This set those with fire safety responsibilities on a confusing and burdensome path to identify and deliver their statutory responsibilities for protecting the public.

Following the Order's introduction, all those with responsibilities for the safety of their premises now have a clear legislative framework, based on the well-established principles of risk assessment and proportionality, in which to operate.

### Localism and Decentralisation

Our policy imperative to drive the decentralisation of power away from the centre to the lowest possible level and develop greater public ownership of the services they receive, should not come as a surprise to many in the audience today.

Our ambition is to drive the transfer of power away from Whitehall to people and communities creating ambitions which energise and empower individuals, communities, businesses and others to build successful neighbourhoods. Public service decentralised and determined by users.

As many of you will be aware, we recently published the Government's response to the sector's Fire Futures reports. This set out how local decision making and restoring a focus on local communities will be at the heart of future Fire and Rescue Service policy.

We are now embarking on work with the fire sector to develop a new National Framework, which will re-set the relationship between fire and rescue authorities and central government. We will help 'barrier bust' where fire and rescue authorities find unnecessary restrictions are stopping them from getting on with things that clearly make great sense.

The Government's focus in the future will be on providing the right framework for national resilience and to enable local Fire and Rescue Authorities and the wider sector to deliver the reform agenda and increased accountability to local communities for the delivery of their services.

### Sector-led and owned fire safety guidance for purpose built flats

Of course, you are here today to develop your thinking on how best you can meet the requirements of the fire safety legislation.

The tragic 2009 fire in Lakanal House, Camberwell - a council-owned high rise block of purpose-built flats in London - gave rise to concerns among housing providers across all tenures - local authorities, housing associations and the private sector. These concerns centred on the adequacy of the risk assessment arrangements that were in place to ensure sufficient fire protection measures to protect the lives of their residents and deliver compliance under both the Fire Safety Order and the Housing Act 2004, which, of course, implements the risk-based Housing Health and Safety Rating System.

These concerns were shared by the enforcing authorities for the two pieces of legislation - fire and rescue services and local authority environmental officers.

In 2007, the Local Authority Coordinators of Regulatory Services (LACoRS as was), the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health Officers came together to develop guidance for landlords and fire safety enforcement officers, in both local housing authorities and fire and rescue services, on how to ensure fire safety in certain types of residential accommodation. Its aim was to provide landlords and enforcing authorities with assistance in complying with the legislative requirements in a consistent and reasonable manner.

Whilst well-received and used by housing providers and enforcement authorities, the sectors agreed that this guidance document was not well positioned to meet the needs of those with fire safety obligations for purpose built blocks of flats, including high rise.

The sector agreed that additional fire safety guidance would be helpful to focus on the particular circumstances and challenges presented by blocks of flats, irrespective of height.

We listened carefully to the concerns of the sector on this. In recognition of their significance, we have provided grant to Local Government Improvement and Development - part of the Local Government Group - to develop and own, on behalf of the sector, practical and proportionate fire safety guidance primarily for the landlords, risk assessors and enforcing authorities of purpose built blocks of flats across all housing sectors.

We expect this guidance to clarify a number of issues including managing fire safety and ensuring residents in these buildings get appropriate advice on what to do in the event of a fire. Local Government Improvement and Development has consulted widely on the draft guidance and, I understand, are now considering in detail the comments that have been received from across the housing and fire sectors.

A Reference Group of key stakeholders from the housing, local authority and fire sectors was established back in January to inform the development of the new guidance. I understand this Group will consider the final draft guidance at a meeting in July. Subject to the Group's views on the extent to which it meets the brief it was given, Local Government Improvement and Development plan to make the final guidance available on its website, and for dissemination by sector partners by the end of July.

This is superb example of the sector coming together to address the challenges that they face in practical terms, and the Department has been pleased, in this instance, to support the project. We also value the contribution being made by the Electrical Safety Council, who are also funding this work.

I trust the new guidance for these types of residential buildings will actively support landlords and others in the task of ensuring the safety of these buildings in the event of fire is effectively managed and maintained.

### Fire Safety Policy - Departmental Priorities

In England, we have a strong record in fire prevention: a record that we can be justifiably proud of.

I am aware that some of you here today have supported calls for more regulation for fire safety in the home and in non-domestic buildings, particularly in relation to smoke alarms and sprinklers. As I have explained, we have absolutely no plans to add to the burden of regulation for businesses and others, especially where non-regulatory routes can offer the same - or better - outcomes.

When we look across the piece we can be in no doubt that the work fire and rescue services do to protect and prevent loss of life and property within our communities makes a real difference.

The latest fire statistics are very encouraging indeed. Fire deaths in the home in England have halved since the 1980s: around 210 people have died in accidental dwelling fires in England over each of the past few years (2006-07 / 2009-10, England).

Of course, one fire death will always be one too many, but this is a terrific achievement, especially when you consider that we have an ageing population which continues to grow, leaving increasing numbers of people vulnerable to risk from fire due to age and infirmity.

We want to maintain and indeed build on these achievements and fire prevention and community safety will remain at the core of our policy objectives.

For example, we recognise the immense value a properly maintained smoke alarms add to life safety and are pleased to have been able to continue to run the Fire Kills campaign during 2011-12, to underpin and support local Fire and Rescue Service initiatives.

As many of you will be aware, the Fire Kills campaign also contracts with 'Wise Up' to specifically target tenants in social housing. 'Wise Up' brings together those wishing to communicate public service information to people living in social housing with the editors of tenant newsletters. Through the Campaign in 2010-11 over half a million residents in social homes have been reached with a fire safety advertorial giving top fire safety tips, including highlighting the importance of having a working smoke alarm installed, as well as guidance on the responsibilities of social housing landlords. This is targeted activity in taking important fire safety messages directly to some of the most vulnerable households in society.

The introduction of fire safer cigarettes across Europe is another important example of how we are improving life chances without recourse to regulation. We fully support the European Commission's efforts in developing a safety standard and test method for reduced ignition cigarettes and referencing this to ensure that, from November 2011 all cigarettes placed on the European market are compliant with this standard.

We estimate that this will save - with almost immediate effect - between 25 and 64 lives per year in England alone, and of course, many more across the whole of the European Union. We are therefore committed to continuing our constructive work with the UK tobacco manufacturers to ensure the necessary arrangements are in place to guarantee compliance with the new standard with effect from November this year.

But we must recognise that Government cannot - nor should attempt - do it all. We do not have the insight or expertise to develop and implement tailored interventions based on the specific needs or aspirations of your local communities.

That is why we are working hard to maintain our partnership approach with local Fire and Rescue Services, and others engaged in delivering public safety, who, in many cases, are much better placed to make the links necessary to deliver locally sustainable safety outcomes.

I am therefore delighted to announce that Cllr Mark Healey, Chair of the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Authority, has kindly agreed to support the work of the Fire Kills campaign to help us promote smoke alarm ownership messages to private rented landlords.

A landlord himself, Mark will, I believe, be a strong and compelling advocate for the campaign to target this particular sector. I am grateful to Mark for his help and assistance in this important matter.

### Closing Preamble

In conclusion, I am grateful to have had this opportunity to talk to you in some detail about the range of fire safety initiatives in which we are involved, and the new - ground-breaking - policy context, based on the development of local and sector-led initiatives, which we are embedding.

I am confident we will continue to develop constructive relationships which will benefit central Government, fire and rescue services and housing providers in the respective roles and, most of all, ensure the safety of all our communities from the devastating effects of fire.

I would like to make a statement to update Hon. Members on the Coalition Government's action on housing, following the publication of our Housing Strategy in November 2011.

We have acted quickly to ensure that the measures set out in the Strategy have a rapid impact on delivering the new homes and jobs that the country needs and put power and incentives back into the hands of local communities.

### Housing finance reform

My Department is today publishing the final determinations which will deliver a Coalition Agreement commitment to replace the discredited Housing Revenue Account subsidy system. This will involve a £19 billion deal between central and local Government, delivering a new devolved system for financing council housing. Responses to our consultation show overwhelming support for our reforms. These reforms will give councils the resources, incentives and flexibility they need to provide high quality, efficient housing services for their communities.

Under the current system, Government makes a series of complex calculations each year about how much it thinks each council should be able to raise in rents and how much it should need to spend on its housing services. On the basis of this desk exercise in Whitehall, Government takes money from some councils and gives money to others.

In recent years, this has produced a national surplus for Government, currently forecast to be around £670 million in 2011-12. This so-called 'tenant tax' would continue to grow each year under the current formula. Local authorities do not know from one year to the next how much they will gain or lose from this redistribution, making it hard for them to plan ahead.

Under the new system, councils will keep all their rent income and use it locally to fund their own homes. This will give councils the stability they need to develop long term business plans with the most efficient local mix of maintenance, repairs and replacement works. Instead of waiting to see what turns up in the annual subsidy round, councils will take responsibility for their homes. This will enable and encourage active local asset management to meet the future housing needs of communities.

Alongside this freedom from central control, councils will have more money to spend on their homes. The reforms do not change the rent policy established by the previous Government in 2001. But the new system deals with the chronic under-funding for capital works under the subsidy system which led to the huge backlog in Decent Homes works. The stock valuations on which the new system is based include higher assumed costs for management, maintenance and repairs, based on independent research. This will give councils on average 15 per cent more to spend on services for tenants.

Today we are publishing the final determinations which provide the legal and financial framework for this new system. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House. The determinations and supporting documents are also available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/housing/socialhousing/councilhousingselffinance/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/socialhousing/councilhousingselffinance/).

The new system will replace the Housing Revenue Account subsidy from April this year.

### The NewBuild Guarantee

We are announcing today that the new build mortgage indemnity scheme will be open for all new build houses and flats up to £500,000 and will be available to UK citizens buying their main home. The scheme will support up to 100,000 prospective borrowers access a 95 per cent loan to value mortgage. This scheme will particularly help first time buyers who currently find the size of a required deposit prohibitive.

We are also announcing today that the scheme will be known as the NewBuild Guarantee. We have already published a guide for those interested in the scheme on our website and house builders are already taking expressions of interest.

### Extending the Right to Buy

On 22 December, my Department published a consultation on proposals for reinvigorating the Right to Buy, suggesting that we offer tenants a £50,000 cap on discounts across England, more than tripling the cap that currently exists in most of London and also giving a substantial increase for the rest of England. This proposal sits alongside plans to deliver one-for-one replacement so that for every home sold under the Right to Buy, a new Affordable Rent home is built.

### Unlocked stalled sites

On 22 December, my Department also published a prospectus for the £420 million 'Get Britain Building' investment fund, which sought expressions of interest from developers by 30 January 2012. This will help unlock progress on stalled sites that have planning permission and are shovel ready, thereby helping to create jobs and economic growth and the delivery of up to 16,000 new homes by December 2014. We halved the paperwork required and the response from industry has been positive with thousands of visits to the web page.

### Regenerating surplus public land

The Government has moved rapidly to take forward the next phase of our programme to free up redundant, formerly used public sector land and buildings to support new homes. We are working with smaller landholding Departments and agencies, such as the Ministry of Justice and Home Office, to maximise the release of their surplus land for housing. We are working not just with government departments and agencies, but also the BBC, Network Rail and the Royal Mail.

We are putting in place support that Departments can draw on to help unlock release of their land, including through the Homes and Communities Agency, and a small advisory group of experts which will start meeting shortly, and provide practical advice to departments on disposal of key sites.

### Fairness in social housing

We are also pressing ahead rapidly with our plans to make social housing fairer, including consultations on new allocations guidance for local authorities to ensure that social homes go to people who genuinely need and deserve them the most, such as hard working families and ex-Servicemen and women; and proposals to tackle fraud in social housing.

### Streamlining building regulations

My Department has also launched yesterday a consultation on streamlining Building Regulations to save businesses money by cutting excessive red-tape whilst delivering safer and more sustainable buildings. The consultation includes proposals for the next steps to improve the energy efficiency of new homes, to pave the way for the introduction of zero-carbon homes from 2016, and for help with the roll out of the Green Deal this autumn.

### Strengthening protection for leaseholders

Last year, my Department consulted on proposals for increasing the value limits that determine the eligibility of residential long leaseholders (those with a lease of more than 21 years) to rights in two specific areas.

These are rights to remain in their properties at the end of their lease terms as an ""assured tenant"" and to extend the lease or purchase the freehold of their leasehold house on particular terms. Legislative change would be subject to Parliamentary approval.

Today I am publishing the summary of responses to the consultation and I can confirm our plans to bring outdated protections for leaseholders back in pace with changing property prices. The Government proposes to raise the £25,000 ""value limit"" - or notional annual rental value - outpaced by house price inflation since it was set in 1990 - to £100,000, enabling many leaseholders to stay in their home when their lease comes to an end. A copy of the summary has been placed in the Library of the House.

### New Homes Bonus

We are announcing today the final payments for the second round of New Homes Bonus. Commenced in April 2011, the Bonus is based on the council tax of additional homes and those brought back into use, with an additional amount for affordable homes, for the following six years.

The Bonus will be paid in respect of 159,000 homes from October 2010 to October 2011 including 22,000 long-term empty properties brought back into use. The allocations also include the first affordable homes enhancement, which totals £21 million in respect of 61,000 new affordable homes.

This means we will pay councils £432 million of New Homes Bonus for local authorities in England. This includes the second instalment of £199 million in respect of year one and £233 million for housing growth in year two. We will also address losses of New Homes Bonus in areas affected by last summer's riots through a separate grant from riot recovery funds.

We are confident that the New Homes Bonus will continue to support local authorities in engaging local communities in a debate about the benefits that growth can bring. The Department has written to local authorities confirming their final allocations and I have written to all Members of Parliament in England. A full list of the allocations is being placed in the Library of the House. Further information on the Bonus can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/).

### Supporting infrastructure: Growing Places

I am also, together with my Right Hon. Friends, the Secretary of State for Transport, and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, confirming individual Growing Places Fund allocations.

This funding will benefit the 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships across the country. It will get housing development moving again, provide additional funding for infrastructure projects already in the pipeline and promote wider economic growth.

Local areas will be in the driving seat, with funding directed to Local Enterprise Partnerships, bringing private sector expertise to help deliver significant infrastructure projects.

Now that funding has been confirmed, Local Enterprise Partnerships and their local authority partners will be able to get to work allocating funds to address the constraints which they consider to be a priority. A number have already identified their priorities, and others are assessing options - we expect funding to be put to work quickly to support local economic growth. Funding will be paid towards the end of February 2012.

In summary, the Coalition Government is getting on with the job of delivering the commitments set out in the Housing Strategy - bringing to life proposals to deliver more new homes, built to the highest quality; to get housebuilders building again; and to support tenants and prospective buyers to own their own home.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,,written-statement,1-Feb-2012,,,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/humberlep,Humber local enterprise partnership,"* * *

I, together with the Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Mark Prisk), would like to inform the House that today we have written to the proposed Humber local enterprise partnership inviting it to put in place governance arrangements.

The Government has moved quickly to recognise the Humber local enterprise partnership proposal, submitted last week, so that they can drive forward their economic ambitions. The Humber local enterprise partnership will focus on strategic opportunities for growth around renewable energy, ports and logistics, chemicals, international trade, strategic transport, infrastructure and innovation and aims to create upwards of 20,000 jobs.

Local enterprise partnerships are a real power shift away from central Government and quangos and towards local communities and the local businesses who really understand the opportunities for and barriers to growth in their areas.

This announcement brings the total number of partnerships so far invited to put their governance arrangements in place to 35. Taken together these represent 1.9m or 95 per cent  of all businesses (active enterprises) in England, 22m employees (employee jobs figures) or 96 per cent  of all employees in England and; a population of 49m or 96 per cent  of England's population. We will continue to work with other areas with a view to establishing further local enterprise partnerships across England.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,,written-statement,8-Jun-2011,,,supporting-economic-growth-through-local-enterprise-partnerships-and-enterprise-zones,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Thank you Nick for your introduction. For those of you that were expecting Eric Pickles, apologies. As Minister with special responsibility for local transparency I'm delighted to be here this morning.

Getting council business out in the open will revolutionise local government and enable the Big Society. I want to talk to you this morning about how everyone can be a part of this revolution, and how transparency is the foundation for the Government's ambitions.

### Context of decentralisation

There are three main drivers for transparency: decentralization; accountability; and the need to reduce the deficit - but they are all interwoven. It is this relationship between them that I want to touch on this morning.

Through decentralisation and the Big Society, councils and local people will have more power to build the communities and services they want. Open data and transparency are key tools in achieving that. This Government is committed to achieving a fundamental shift in the way this country is governed. The publication of Departmental business plans on Monday will bring about a fundamental change in how Department's are held to account for implementing policy commitments. Our success will be measured by the degree to which transparency helps shift the focus from bureaucratic to democratic accountability.

This shift is already happening: Councils are being freed from top-down bureaucratic control and centralist performance management; freed from the burdens of centrally enforced targets; and freed from the burdens of inspection by our abolition of the costly and bureaucratic Comprehensive Area Assessment and the Audit Commission. We have marked the end of the old, top-down local performance framework and have made a fresh start underpinned by genuine localism, with councils becoming more directly accountable to local people for the services they provide and the money they spend.

The Government is clear that deficit reduction, and securing economic recovery, is the most pressing issue facing Britain today. Councils are responsible for their own finances, and any unjustified spending should be rooted out, in the first instance, by senior financial officers and elected members. But pressure from local residents for councils to justify overspending and waste can help reinforce this scrutiny.

But they can only do this if they have the information they need at their fingertips.

That is why this Government is committed to increasing transparency across Whitehall and local authorities in order to make data more readily available to the citizen and allow them to hold service providers to account.

### Transparency

So the aim of every one of us should be to: firstly - publish all data you hold unless it is illegal to do so; secondly - keep safe the personal data you hold; and thirdly - be absolutely clear about what data it is you hold.

But what does transparency mean and where to start?

The Secretary of State has called upon councils to increase transparency and openness about how they do their business by publishing information on senior salaries, councillor allowances and all spending over £500 as a first step.

Other types of data including council minutes, decisions and papers, expenses, organograms, service information, performance data, food hygiene reports and licensing applications should also be freely and openly available. All contain invaluable information to help not only citizens hold councils to account, but also assist officers and councillors question the way they conduct their business.

Simply making this data available is a good first step, but to make it truly useful it is imperative that we all - Government and local government - work towards providing data that complies with the public data principles, that are being developed by the Public Sector Transparency Board. I won't repeat them all here, but there are a few that deserve a particular mention in the context of revolutionising local democracy.

Firstly, public data policy and practice will be clearly driven by the public and businesses who want and use the data, including what data is released when and in what form. We are moving away from the days when central government demanded data from you, but instead councils will need to respond to data requests from the public.

Secondly, public data will be released under the same open licence which enables free reuse, including commercial reuse. There is a value to data - not just to your citizens, but to the wider economy. To realise that value, you must publish data with an open hand, and let others analyse, interrogate and present it back to you, your residents and others. Not only should you allow it, you should encourage it - partly by having up to date data asset registers, but also making the data timely and appropriately formatted.

I am clear that, despite needing some effort at the outset, it is in councils' own interests to make data open, accessible, comparable and timely. But it is for the sector - not government - to set its own standards as to how this is done. The list of councils that are already publishing this data is growing daily. For those of you that have not, and think there are practical and technical obstacles stopping you, then speak to those that are already publishing the data - they may well have tackled these issues already.

Guidance has also been produced by the Local Public Data Panel on £500 spend, and the Local Government Group have developed guides, in partnership with central government and sector experts, setting out how councils can publish financial data on salaries, spending, contracts and tenders over £500 to meet the January 2011 deadline. And we are looking to see whether more guidance is needed on a common method of publication, so that there is easy comparability of data. The 'Spending practitioners guide' and 'Salaries disclosure guide' will be revised on an ongoing basis to reflect councils' experience and feedback.

And just to show that we're not expecting councils to do something that we're not prepared to do ourselves, my Department is also now publishing details of its spend over £500 - leading from the front in ensuring Whitehall also makes its own spending transparent.

### What will good look like?

But let's remember that we are not publishing data for the sake of it - there must be some real world benefit. Setting data free will give the public greater insight into what their local authorities are doing, what is happening in their local area, and most importantly where their money is going.

We are living in challenging times. Where cuts to services are proposed, citizens must be able to see how decisions are being made and their opportunities for influencing them.

Citizens need information to suggest new ways of doing things and to get involved.

There are different ways of getting this data to them.

There will be some armchair auditors who will pore through data and challenge their council on some aspect or other.

And alongside this, releasing the data in its rawest state will enable businesses and non-profit organisations to build innovative applications and websites which will make the data easier to understand.

We are already seeing good examples of this on websites such as Openly Local, Where Does My Money Go, Armchair Auditor and Spotlight on Spend and through tools such as You Choose.

On the other hand, pages of figures on endless excel spreadsheets will mean nothing to many ordinary citizens. Councils will, rightly, want to present their data in such a way as to make it more meaningful to individuals and community groups. This is why transparency is integral to the Big Society.

For some groups - communities of interest, or brought together in a locality - there will be lobby groups who will interpret data for their benefit to help them push for change. It will also, in some cases, be the media who will use your data.

But what does this mean for you as scrutiny councillors? The challenge is how do you help people to use this wealth of information to press for their cause and hold their local leaders to account? What can Scrutiny Committees and Councils do to strengthen local scrutiny, both through existing formal routes and the wider web of accountability? What more can Government do? How can we get developers interested in these local datasets?

Last week I participated in the Local by Social online conference. This was an exciting and innovative way to bring together a range of experts to discuss how the internet can be used to deliver services, influence how localities are governed and, crucially, strengthen local accountability. I was very interested in the conversations that followed the presentations given by Swansea and Coventry on what they have done with social media, and the conversation that took place with Councillors on social media surgeries.

To me, the critical word here is conversation - how can social media and transparent open data be brought together to enable Councils to have a conversation with their residents? How can local open data be used in innovative ways to rebuild the accountability relationship? What can I do as Minister with special responsibility for local Transparency to help you drive localism and facilitate those conversations that I know you are having already, but want to be having with more people in your communities? How do we use open data, social media, and other tools to bring people into the decision-making process, as well as to raise an army of armchair auditors?

I am sure that many of you are at the forefront of this agenda, either as part of 'Tweetyhall', or through other social media activities. As I'm sure you know, Eric Pickles, is a keen tweeter, though I, I have to admit, am catching up with this agenda.

These are exciting, as well as challenging, times, and I see no limit to the opportunities that we can give people through greater transparency and democratic accountability. This government is doing what it can. You all have a pivotal role in supporting your councils to make your data available, and your residents to make the best use of it.",baroness-hanham,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/baronesshanham,"Mary Ward House, London",,,,10-Nov-2010,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,baroness-hanham,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/1923924,Improving frontline rubbish and recycling services for family homes,"* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Thank you for inviting me to speak at this useful and timely Conference following the launch of the Government's Waste Review.

As a Minister at the Department for Communities and Local Government, it will be no surprise that my concern is householders and the frontline services their council provides. Under the previous administration, I believe there was a failure to realise that for a £120 a month in council tax, families expect and deserve comprehensive recycling and rubbish collections.

Yet over the last decade, bins have moved up and up the political agenda. For many newspapers, bins are the third biggest postbag issue - after immigration and Europe.

Phrases like the 'Town Hall Talibin', 'Bin Brother' and the 'Binquisition' entered the political lexicon. This reflects a source of frustration by local residents and a failure by the Government to win over the public to recycling.

The cause of localism has been undermined not strengthened, by setting residents up to view their council with resentment rather than respect.

At the heart of that were policies of the last administration to use taxes, restrictions and fines, to drive waste policies. The Coalition Government fundamentally takes different approach - we want to work with families to go green, and use incentives to reward and encourage socially responsible behaviour.

My department has worked very closely with Caroline Spelman on this Review to identify ways we can work with local councils to deliver waste collection services that meet their resident's needs.

Yesterday we unveiled a range of measures that will help improve households' bin collection services.

### Bin fines, snooping and bin taxes

Three issues are particularly corrosive to the trust between councils and residents when it comes to waste services: a stealthy imposition of bin fines, bin snooping and bin taxes.

This Government is committed to taking a stand on all three.

Starting with fines we want to make sure residents aren't penalised for minor mistakes.

It's patently not fair that under the last Government families were being fined more than shoplifters for not closing a bin lid or putting a yoghurt pot into the wrong bin.

So we are ditching unfair bin fines meaning town halls can no longer take householders to court and impose £1,000 fines for minor issues like this.

The Review commits us to working with local authorities to introduce a new 'harm to local amenity test', which will rightly target serious offenders who make the neighbourhood into a rubbish tip. And anti-social litterlouts.

Fixed penalty notices will be firmly targeted at the neighbours from hell who blight their local areas while responsible householders who try to do the right thing are left alone.

We are also taking a firm line on the unpleasant practise of bin snooping - secretive bin searches to find out what the public are throwing away.

We've already issued guidance on this. And now we are repealing powers of entry into domestic premises for evidence gathering purposes and a switch from criminal to civil penalties for extreme cases.

We are also scrapping plans to introduce ""pay as you throw"" bin tax schemes under the Localism Bill.

These would have unfairly penalised families who produce more waste, and ended up encouraging fly tipping and backyard burning. In the Republic of Ireland, the biggest source of dioxins in the air is from the domestic burning of rubbish. Bin charging was introduced as an environmental measure, but actually, it has harmed the local environment.

And finally we are again addressing the worrying assumption that it is okay for councils to charge for waste services. Council tax certainly is not a popular tax. But fundamentally, it is the local services tax which is supposed to pay for councils' frontline services.

As Lord Henley and I wrote to councils earlier this year: Councils cannot introduce 'backdoor' bin charging for mainstream waste collections.

Families deserve a bin collection service without bin bag charges on top.

  * Instead we want to make it easier for councils to work with householders, rather than against them.
  * Encourage housholders to recycle and reward them for going green - instead of punishing them with fines, taxes and snooping.
  * Genuine reward schemes like Recyclebank have been successful used to increase recycling in councils like Windsor and Maidenhead.

And civil amenity sites should remain free at the point of use for local residents to dispose of their household waste responsibly. Charging households for local recycling and amenity sites - so-called tip taxes - is utterly counter-productive. It would just encourage more fly-tipping, which is expensive to clean up, and it would discourage the responsible disposal of electrical waste. Indeed, recycling sites are a source of revenue for local authorities - from selling on the materials collected for both recycling and for re-use.

It's not without reason that Tesco - they're no fools - has recently taken control of the municipal recycling banks in its supermarket car parks. There's money there.

### Localism and doing more for less

There are people who say we should let councils get on with this if we're committed to localism.

The last Government adopted an explicit 'Household Waste Prevention Policy Programme' pushing for bin cuts, bin taxes and bin fines.

The policy demanded ""collection limitations in terms of rubbish bin size or the interval between collections"", and sought to ""nationalise this policy among local authorities"".

Combined with the gold-plating of EU directives, such policy diktats demolish the suggestion that cutting weekly rubbish collections was a 'local policy' chosen by councils.

Now-repealed Whitehall guidance by WRAP (Water and Resources Action Programme) pressured councils to cut weekly collections. It told town halls that councillors should be pressured to stop them opposing the axing of collections. It also instructed that bin cuts should be done after local elections - to avoid democratic opposition. This wasn't localism - but an assault on local democracy.

But localism means much more than a tug of war of political power between Whitehall and the town halls.

It's about a fundamental shake up of the balance of power - and the relationship between councils and residents must change as much.

Councils have got to be accountable to their residents. That's why we're giving them a greater voice to say when they are not satisfied through their power to challenge basic services under our Localism Bill.

Certainly, councils are facing a very challenging time finding savings. We have inherited a massive legacy of debt that the whole country has to now pay off.

That the age of carefree public spending is over and that all parts of the public sector have to find new and productive ways to make every pound of tax payers money stretch further to preserve key front line services.

The easy option is to salami slice key frontline services such as bin collections.

But the best councils are sharing back office staff; shining a spotlight on waste; cracking down on senior pay; collaborating to spend smarter; and using some of their £10 billion rainy day savings.

Councils still have revenue spending of £53 billion. They need to talk to their residents and find out what services people want to protect.

I visited last year Dartford where they had held a referendum - a Big Bin Vote - on whether to keep their weekly bin collection. 94.5 per cent said yes - and so they kept it on by achieving savings from a back office shared service agreement with Sevenoaks.

Better procurement and joint working can improve the efficiency and affordability of collections while improving the frontline service for the public.

That is why authorities like East Northamptonshire, who have recently negotiated a new waste management contract to be able to offer their residents a weekly collection by eliminating cost.

Likewise Cornwall council streamlined their waste collection contracts from six to one council wide contract cutting a £25 million cost by £3 million and providing a better service. Cornwall is a unitary council, but you don't need to go through the expensive process of restructuring to share services.

And West Norfolk is keeping bin collections weekly through a new shared service deal with neighbouring North Norfolk District due to save £400,000.

It's important with shared services that local democratic accountability is retained - at the end of the day, the local electorate must have the right to decide.

### Weekly collections

Weekly collections have been a key issue for our department. We moved quickly to ditch the last Government's policy of imposing fortnightly collections for all.

We withdrew Audit Commission guidance encouraging councils to switch to fortnightly collections, and we have removed their inspections that marked down councils that did not give up on weekly collections.

We have also got rid of the perverse financial incentives created by Local Area Agreements to downgrade waste collection services through Performance Reward Grant.

And we promised to work with councils to increase the frequency and quality of bin collections.

The Waste Review is very clear; the Government understands householders have a reasonable expectation that their smelly rubbish will be collected weekly.

And the Government will be working with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, and to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections.

The Government will also work with WRAP to monitor service levels to understand whether and how they are changing, keeping the quality, affordability and frequency of household waste collections under review.

It's important to understand what factors affect the quality, cost and frequency of household waste collections because one size does not fit all in terms of configuration.

But at the same time residents across the country are entitled to want their tax money to go towards a weekly service.

And I hope we will be making further announcements in due course on how we intend to support increasing frequency of collections.

There is considerable variety in the efficiency of waste collection. Some 'can-do' councils are being innovative and taking steps to preserve this visible front line service as we've seen.

They recognise that for many council tax payers, their household waste collection is the most visible service they receive for their council tax.

### Conclusion

Public policy on bins may have had the best of intentions over the years.

But there's no doubt that a large gap has emerged between public expectations and the level of services many now receive.

But it's local people who pay their taxes - and we need to listen to their views on to develop comprehensive recycling and rubbish collections for all.

It is to benefit of the reputation of local government and the broader waste industry that we get this right. This is an opportunity to show that protecting the environment and protecting convenient frontline services go hand in hand.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,"Lincoln's Inn Fields, London",,,,15-Jun-2011,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

Together with my right hon. Friends, the Secretary of State for Transport, and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, I am today announcing details about the operation of the Government's £500 million Growing Places Fund.  
   
The Fund will be available to get stalled sites for housing development moving again; provide additional funding for infrastructure projects already in the pipeline; and promote wider economic growth.

Local areas will be in the driving seat, with funding directed to Local Enterprise Partnerships, which will bring private sector expertise to the prioritisation and delivery of significant infrastructure projects.

We are publishing a short Prospectus today which sets out the key features of our approach and invites expressions of interest for funding from Local Enterprise Partnerships. We are inviting these by 20 December, with the intention of announcing allocations in January. A copy of the Prospectus will be placed in the Library of the House, and will also be available on my Department's website.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

I'm delighted to be here today.

I've been involved in anti-racist work for as long as I've been a member of the Conservatives.

To have this opportunity to talk to you about something that matters deeply to all of us.

And to listen to what you have to say.

It's vital we have this debate.

> ""Integration is what makes our communities tick.""

And, if we think about it more broadly, community cohesion or integration, call it what you will, starts with our ability to talk and to listen.

Traditionally we've been very good at that in this country.

Debate is the very cornerstone of our democracy.

Our commitment to free speech is what has made us a beacon to other nations.

But there is always a balance to be struck.

Where do we draw the line?

The multiculturalist approach meant well.

I haven't forgotten a trip I made to Bradford with my mother, asking her why there was a sign up in a cafe saying ""no blacks in here"".

Something had to be done to counter that casual racism and intolerance.

Something had to be done to stop that assault on freedom of speech.

People had to feel comfortable in their own skin.

Safe in their own neighbourhoods.

So the law was used rightly to remove the freedom to insult.

To remove the discrimination against people in their own towns.

As a result, when we look back, the 60s and 70s seems like a world away.

Indeed I was listening to Andrew Marr on the radio this morning when he pointed out that the 1960s are closer to the First World War than we are now to the 1960s.

It's true there are still problems but these days we're a lot more relaxed.

A Sikh with a kirpan is no more threatening to public safety than a Scotsman with a sgian-dubh.

But the trouble with multiculturalism was that it went too far in the wrong direction.

We got the balance wrong.

It got muddled up.

And it failed to stem the rise of a new bigotry.

A bigotry that says if you wear the hijab you can't be British.

A bigotry that says if you support Israel you can't be British.

And the rise in anti-semitism disguised as anti-Israel is one of the most deeply distressing facets of recent public life.

A bigotry that says expecting people to speak a common language isn't part of being British.

But in trying to make sure every special interest group had their say, multiculturalism drowned out the still small voice of common sense.

> ""You don't need to have fought on one side of the battle of Hastings or the other to be British.""

Drowned out our common view.

We spent more time worrying about our differences than what we had in common.

Every now and then someone stuck their head above the parapet.

Back in 2001 it was our opening speaker, Ted himself, who spelt out the problem in his report Parallel Lives.

> ""Whilst the physical segregation of housing estates and inner city areas came as no surprise…,"" he wrote… ""the team was particularly struck by the depth of polarisation of our towns and cities.
> 
> ""These lives often do not seem to touch at any point, let alone overlap and promote any meaningful interchanges.""

Ted saw what we all saw but that some refused to see.

People trapped in neighbourhoods.

People smothered by the cultural comfort blanket.

That spirit of adventure…

…that spirit of risk taking.

…that spirit that encouraged Caribbean, Jewish, Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani communities to work their socks off for a better life.

…that encouraged Yasmin herself to take her chances and come here as a graduate.

Snuffed out.

Imagine if someone like Jaffer Kapasi - one of 20,000 Ugandan Asians fleeing persecution from Idi Amin back in the early seventies - had decided to follow the script of segregation.

But Jaffer had no interest in staying in doors.

He became a businessman. A Treasurer of the Leicestershire Asian Business Association. An OBE.

And I remember those ridiculous adverts that the council took out in Leicester saying ""we're full don't come here"".

Well, look what happened.

Leicester's British Uganduans transformed the city's economy and brought in thousands of jobs.

They didn't shy away from moving on.

And all of us here today owe a debt to our estimated 200,000 Asian businesses in the UK - contributing about ten per cent of the country's GDP.

So our vibrant communities make us strong.

They are part of our economic future.

They make us a global draw.

The links with the new economic powerhouses in India, China, Pakistan and Africa give us a huge economic advantage.

And Britain would certainly be poorer without them.

But if segregation is a waste of space how do we start to create a more socially cohesive society?

We've already started.

We're talking.

We're having the debate.

And it's not always easy talking about these issues.

The other day I got into a bit of bother for saying that I wanted all citizens to speak like a native.

A few people said it was racist.

So I'm glad that here I've got a chance to say my piece.

Let me be clear.

A Muslim from Bradford is a British native.

A Sikh from Birmingham is a British native.

A Hindu from Harrow is a British native.

I don't expect people to talk like David Cameron.

I'm not looking for uniformity of accent just a common language.

Unless you have a good command of English it reduces people's life chances, reduces social mobility.

I want more people to sound like me.

But only if they're from Yorkshire.

The point is you don't need to have fought on one side of the battle of Hastings or the other to be British.

You can be British and retain your cultural heritage.

Look at the English language itself.

It embraces thousands of words from different cultures - French, German, Chinese, Latin, Yiddish - yet it remains distinctively English.

And it has flourished.

We're saying all you need to put down roots in this country is respect for the law, respect for freedom of speech and respect for your fellow citizen.

For many this just means continuing to do what comes naturally.

Take our faith communities.

I've never come across a church, temple, mosque, synagogue, gurdwara or any other place of worship that looked wholly within: that did not want to take care of its neighbours, no matter if they had a different faith, or none.

In fact, earlier this year I joined faith leaders at the National Baha'i Centre to mark the launch of our Year of Service.

There was nothing I could tell them about improving the lives of others that they hadn't been doing for years.

Nothing I could tell them about being good British citizens.

That's why, as a Government, we do do God.

But sometimes people of faith get a bad rap.

We've seen men and women disciplined for wearing a cross or carrying a rosary.

We've witnessed legal challenges to councils opening their proceedings with prayers.

How unreasonable.

How unBritish.

How bigoted.

These symbols of faith bring comfort to many and hurt no-one.

More than that they are based on values that underpin our society.

We want people of all faiths to feel at home and to contribute to our society. We want people of no faith to feel at home and to contribute to our society.

> ""Sometimes you can bang the drum for liberty and sometimes you bang the drum for fun.""

That means talking them up not knocking them down.

But while it's good to talk, we must do more to show integration in action.

It's about real life. About the fellowship of different communities coming together.

No-one does national events better than the British.

And this year we've two of the biggest in the form of the Olympics and the Diamond Jubilee.

These national occasions are festivals of integration.

So we're supporting them through activities like the Big Jubilee Lunch.

It isn't some sort of sociology test.

Just about the enjoyment of being British.

Ensuring folk have, as Wallace might say to Gromit, a grand day out.

And I expect to see everyone in this room joining the street parties, breaking out the bunting, waving their flags and quaffing libations from their Jubilee mugs.

Nor is this the only event we've got coming up.

On the final day of the Paralympic Games there's the Bandstand marathon.

An end of show party to end all end of show parties.

500 areas across the country coming together to enjoy the fellowship of music.

Whether it's a steel drum playing in a local park.

A piano recital in a shopping centre.

A choral choir in a public garden.

The one thing that's guaranteed, you won't have seen anything like it before.

Earlier this month I went along to Colchester where they were putting on a mini music event - a taste of things to come.

As I arrived all the kids were being taught to play African drums.

It was something the good people of Colchester had not seen before.

And watching them enjoying those rhythms of Africa was a joy to be seen.

Everyone was captivated by the sounds of the African drums.

Even the people who weren't taking part were getting into it.

I came across people in the local park swaying along to those African beats without even knowing they were doing it.

People enjoying a new experience.

It goes to show.

Sometimes you can bang the drum for liberty and sometimes you bang the drum for fun.

And it's that understanding that will make this country a better place now and ten, twenty, thirty years down the line.

Because integration is what makes our communities tick.

Integration is respect for your fellow British citizen.

Integration is what makes our country great.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"One Birdcage Walk, London",,,,23-Apr-2012,bringing-people-together-in-strong-united-communities,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/2079141,It's all about delivery,"* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Are you a veteran if you've done the same job for five years?

Normally the answer would be no - unless of course you cover the Government's housing portfolio like I do.

During this time I've seen a total of eight - yes eight - opposing Housing Ministers come and go.

But does this matter?

Well yes if you care about the state of housing in this country.

An endless reshuffling of the ministerial pack meant an endless reshuffling of ideas and initiatives.

But this conveyer belt of policies didn't deliver - and we all watched in horror as the housing sector entered its darkest hours since the 1920s.

Now, the Prime Minister launched our Housing Strategy last November to great fanfare.

He made it very clear - housing will be centre stage of the nation's economic recovery.

I'm very proud of that, naturally.

But what I really want is to bring the proposals in the strategy to life - and quickly.

  * I want to see more new homes - built to the highest quality.
  * I want to see housebuilders helped to build these homes - where communities want them.
  * And I want to see more people buy their first home.

This isn't a question of political preference.

It's people's lives we're talking about:

  * the lives of the hundreds of thousands of families on waiting lists
  * the young couples desperate to move into their own home
  * the council tenants who aspire to buy.

So there's no time to hang about.

And I've been very clear with my Department: no ifs, no buts.

We're getting on with the job - and we're moving at pace.

### Progress so far

It's less than three months since we published the housing strategy and six weeks before the budget - so let's check in on progress.

Our action to get the country building again is playing a vital and central role in putting the economy on the road to recovery.

Take our **Get Britain Building fund**.

£420 million to start shovel-ready sites where that injection of capital can get the whole thing moving.

The prospectus was quickly published.

And I can announce that we have already identified 18 of the most difficult stalled sites on public land - on which work will begin soon.

All the details will be published today on the Homes and Communities Agency website.

For the rest of the cash we've made it as simple as we possibly can to bid by halving the paperwork - and we've opened the door to all types of firms to compete.

The final set of bids will be considered next month - and already we can see the quality of some of the proposals.

We were hoping to start work on the first sites in autumn.

But today I can tell you we're intending for the first ground to be broken considerably earlier.

Watch this space.

We also want to make land available so more homes can be built where people want them.

So today I can confirm that we've identified surplus public land with enough capacity for over 80,000 new homes.

Putting ourselves well on track to release enough land for 100,000 homes by 2015.

But I want to move even faster.

So I'm working with another six Government departments together with other large organisations including the BBC, Network Rail and the Royal Mail to identify further disused land.

This is not just about numbers.

Unlike the era of top-down targets we want to build new homes with the support of communities - not just build a sense of resentment and injustice.

That's why we introduced the **New Homes Bonus**.

It's year two of this Government and it's year two of the New Homes Bonus.

Today I can announce over £430 million for communities who helped deliver 159,000 homes last year - 22,000 of these being empty homes brought back into use.

It's more than double the previous year.

The Bonus payments last for six years - so communities can expect to see more cash increases for several years.

That's the way we like to do things:

  * give councils and communities genuine choice and genuine reasons to say ""yes"" to growth
  * and let local people to see and feel the benefits of development in their neighbourhood.

Already the Bonus is being spent in ways that are changing minds and attitudes.

Take Wychavon in Worcestershire - not a big council area by any means. But now there's:

  * £200,000 of New Homes Bonus cash for supporting regeneration projects.
  * £100,000 going to local charities.

The Bonus has gone from being a piece of paper to established policy.

And it's here to stay.

So it's now time for all councils to talk to the people in their area about how they want their Bonus spent.

And let's be clear - it is the community's Bonus. So it is only fair that they take part in discussions and any decisions about its use.

Of course it's no good just helping housebuilders build homes - **we need people to buy them**.

That's why at the heart of our housing strategy we've committed to go the extra mile for those aspiring to get on the housing ladder.

The deposits needed to buy a home have gone through the roof.

For millions of young people the desire to buy a home is no longer a dream - but a distant fantasy.

We are going help them.

Starting in March the **NewBuy Guarantee** will give thousands of prospective buyers the chance to buy a home with a fraction of the deposit normally required.

It'll help people buying a new-build property - be that a house or a flat with a value up to £500,000 - get a 95 per cent loan.

Where a buyer may typically need a £40,000 deposit - a £10,000 deposit will put them in a property of their own.

Today I'm publishing details of who will be eligible for this support.

Anyone interested can now see on my department's website if this scheme would work for them.

And because we want to help everyone achieve their aspirations, to feel the pride of ownership - we're scrapping the miserly restrictions on the level of discounts under **Right to Buy**.

Up to 100,000 tenants will have the opportunity to buy their own home.

It's great news for every hardworking family who have done well for themselves and want to get on.

But we've also been clear that it's vital to keep up the number of affordable homes.

So this will be a one-out, one-in policy.

In other words a new home built for every home sold.

Good news for all those on the housing waiting lists.

That's why we wasted no time and I published the proposals before Christmas.

But I want to go further.

Right to Buy restrictions aren't the only bureaucratic burden on council tenants that should be removed.

I also want to end the multi-billion pound tax inflicted on tenants by the complex system for council housing finance.

**The Tenants' Tax** is the offspring of that arcane creature we call the Housing Revenue Account Subsidy System.

Not many people outside this room would have ever heard of that one.

But it affects millions of council tenants.

Councils collect rents from their tenants - then every year they wait patiently to hear Whitehall's decision about what they are allowed to keep.

Bureaucracy at its bonkers best.

Authorities that have more tenants and collect millions in social rent only keep a fraction of the cash.

A tax on millions of council tenants - because as far as they are concerned, their rent just disappears into a Treasury a black hole.

The Localism Act paved the way for the long-awaited and sorely needed removal of this system.

And now, just two months after the Act achieved Royal Assent, I'm confirming today the details of an historic settlement that puts councils back in charge.

The new system will level the playing field.

Council landlords will keep the rent they collect - giving them an average 15 per cent more to spend on maintaining homes.

Less fun for bureaucrats - but at last a direct link between the rent councils charge and the money they spend.

They will have the financial tools to plan their budgets more effectively.

Modernising and improving the homes of existing tenants - and making it easier to build new affordable houses.

This £19 billion deal may not hit the front pages tomorrow - but it is one of the most substantial and significant steps towards localism in years.

And make no mistake: it is localism that is driving the success of our policies to help families who need affordable homes.

**Take our affordable homes programme**.

A smart system with more freedom for those at the sharp end.

Critics have used every opportunity to twist the facts - telling us it won't work in London, in Hull, in rural or urban areas.

They've predicted doom and said this radical new approach will never succeed in the current economic climate.

But I can tell you that today we have 150,000 homes being developed or under contract, and we're on track for 170,000 by 2015 - 20,000 more than expected.

We're not just meeting our aspirations - we're beating them!

### Conclusion

This is the approach we promised - and it is the approach we have delivered.

It's more pace and less paperwork.

And as I continue to drive forward the Housing Strategy, you can expect more to come.

The saying goes that patience is a virtue.

But when it comes to:

  * families crying out for new homes
  * tenants who want more control
  * and communities who want more choice

I'm afraid patience is not a virtue I share.

So at last the housing sector has reasons to be optimistic.

Our new approach will:

  * give a helping hand to this generation of homebuyers
  * boost the provision of affordable homes
  * and help the nation's housebuilders get building again

We have taken decisive action - and we are under no illusion that much more needs to be done.

But no one should doubt our determination to drive through this programme of radical reform to boost our economy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.

### Introduction

![Bob Neill speaking at the Fire & Rescue 2010 Conference](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1627360.jpg)I would like to thank you for inviting me to be here today. I am now in my seventh week as the Fire Minister and it is already a role that I am relishing, including the challenges it poses at this time and we're all too well aware of these.

It was a particular pleasure for me to take on this post as this is a service which is very important to me. That isn't just rhetoric I hope that I can claim a genuine track record. 25 years ago I became the first leader of the then London Fire and Civil Defence Authority. Later, I served on its successor LFEPA. Up until last month, my wife was a member of a Fire Authority. I had the pleasure of shadowing this portfolio for a time whilst in Opposition.

In the weeks that I have been in post, and from that previous knowledge I am fully aware of the breadth and depth of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work within it. You provide a trusted local service to your communities yet effectively respond to national emergencies where the interoperability and resilience on the ground becomes apparent and important.

The fire and rescue service has been hugely successful in ensuring that our communities are safer places and less exposed to the destruction and devastation caused by fire. You have played a full part as partners in delivering other local priorities and we naturally want that success to continue.

Put simply, the work you do saves lives. Fire Safety strategies are succeeding. Fire deaths in the home in England have halved since the 1980s. The long-term trend is downwards: in 2008, 213 people perished in accidental fires in the home. Of course, one fire death is one too many, but nevertheless real progress has been made. Recent statistics, however, suggest that the long term downward trend is beginning to plateau and we all need to look at how we can continue to drive deaths down further still.

It is not always easy, we all know that. Last year on the 3rd of July we saw the devastating fire in Lakanal House, Camberwell in which 6 residents lost their lives, and I recognise that tragically firefighters have lost their lives whilst attending incidents over recent years.

On the 6th of April this year we had the tragic loss of Firefighters Alan Bannon and James Shears (Red Watch, St Mary's Fire Station) who died at the Shirley Towers, Southampton and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to them and to all other firefighters who have lost their lives. Both myself and the Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser will continue to seek to learn lessons from these tragedies.

I appreciate that firefighters work is not just restricted to this country. You have also shown great resilience in responding to international catastrophes such as the terrible events in Haiti. One of my first events as Fire Minister was to meet with some of the Haiti crews at Downing Street and the Firefighter Charity awards. It was a humbling, yet proud experience.

So what I say here today, however challenging it may be, I, and this Coalition Government, recognise and value greatly the work that you do, we have the highest regard for the work of all our public services, and you, within the fire and rescue service, are an exemplar of what public services are all about.

### Economic challenge

Early into the new coalition we find ourselves facing tough choices around funding. When the Prime Minister took up office at Number 10 he was faced with a bill for £156 billion of public debt. The Government has made it clear from the outset, and as shown by the Budget last week, that deficit reduction is our most urgent priority.

This, and continuing to ensure economic recovery, is the most pressing issue facing our Country. We all need to restore confidence and support the recovery. It is better to start making those reductions now, as not to do so will simply delay the need for savings in future years.

This means that we must be utterly rigorous in prioritising resources to support frontline services, whilst cutting waste through greater transparency, improving efficiency through more joint working and energetically delivering value for money in procurement.

It has never been more important that we are open to new ideas, to new ways of working and delivery, and to greater flexibility in providing services.

These represent big challenges for us all. We all have our part to play. But, this is also our opportunity, for a better, more ambitious future. Because these challenges are not mere problems - they are a mandate for change.

### Government vision

Necessity is the mother of invention. Change begets change and it is time for a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to individuals and their communities. I am talking about localism.

There has been too much central government prescription telling you what to do in your local area. As has been made clear by the Prime Minister the days of big government are over and the days of Big Society and Localism have begun.

It is time for us to reset the relationship between central government and local government. The tired old bureaucratic approach needs to go. We want people to feel connected to their communities, proud of their communities and we are giving people a real say over what happens in their communities. This is not just a shift of power, but of culture.

The devolution of the power to individuals, to communities will make a real difference to the way local services are delivered, to the way communities hold service providers accountable.

We are serious about this. We are going to shake up the balance of power and change the constitution. As our Secretary of State, Eric Pickles would say our 3 priorities in order of priority, one, localism, and we'll weave that into everything we do. The second priority is localism, and the third is, you've guessed it localism. But not necessarily in that order.

It won't be a single action or a single law that we collectively embed the changes that are needed. It will be through dramatic and bold actions, but also small and incremental changes. Localism is the principle, the philosophy that defines everything we do.

So when I talk of a mandate for change, I am talking of opportunity.

Opportunity to build the Big Society and do things better by pushing power back to the people.

Opportunity for localism to become embedded in this country and all that we do.

Opportunity for you in fire and rescue services to shine and strengthen the engagement you already have in your communities.

For example, we recognise and value the important role the parts of the fire and rescue service play in their communities in working with vulnerable and disadvantaged young people, including those who may take part in anti-social behaviour. You do this through a wide range of initiatives focussed on the needs of young people and their communities both independently and in partnership with other local agencies.

And across England, the vital contribution of retained duty system firefighters provides an excellent example of how localism and the Big Society are already embedded within parts of the fire and rescue service. They serve and protect their local community and at the same time provide a crucial element of national resilience.

In the sphere of Local Government it is clear already that the pace of change is rapid. We want to hand more choice and more freedom back to local authorities, fire authorities and the communities they represent. Activity should take place at the most local level possible to give people a real say in what happens in their area.

We will not be moving back to prescriptive national standards. The Integrated Risk Management Plan process is already established and provides a sound basis to allow for the provision of local services driven by the local agenda and based on local risks and need of the local community. Localism, we all need to live it, not just say it.

This is just the start. As we said in the Coalition Agreement we will ""promote a radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local government and community groups"". We want to make sure that we treat Local Government like grown-ups rather than insisting that a nanny state knows best.

### Changing relationship and challenges for the FRS

However, you would still be forgiven for thinking that all governments talk about shifting power. But we have proved it by getting on and doing it with pace:

  * We've made HIPS history and already the number of homes being put up for sale has gone up 35 per cent.
  * We've given a lifeline to thousands of businesses in ports who had huge backdated business rates hanging over their heads.
  * We have scrapped the top down housing targets and meaningless regional spatial strategies.
  * We've put an end to 'garden grabbing' which has seen acres of land lost to intensive development.
  * We've cut the ring fencing and red tape which comes attached to hundreds of millions pounds worth of central government grants.
  * We're leading by example in making central government more open, more transparent, more accountable.
  * And we're showing we're serious about saving money, taking pay cuts ourselves and announcing a public sector pay freeze in last week's Budget.

With localism in mind we are also looking across the piece at what central government does and asking the question ""should we?""

Should we be telling the fire and rescue service what constitutes frontline; surely you know best what your local priorities are and should be deciding what constitutes your frontline yourselves?

Should we continue to require fire and rescue authorities to work through Regional Management Boards or allow the freedom for individual authorities to work on a collaborative basis in a way that works best for you locally - not determined by regional boundaries?

Should we be setting national targets for you to achieve better diversity in your workforce? Isn't this is an area where you should show your own leadership and commitment and choose to challenge yourselves rather than looking to government for that challenge.

Should we be telling you how to recruit and develop your staff? You are the Employers and you should know best your workforce requirements.

Should we be looking to regulate further? 'No' would be my answer. We must move away from the view that the only way to solve problems is to regulate, neither you nor business need to be bound hand and foot with red tape.

Take sprinklers for example. Just a couple of weeks ago I visited West Midlands where I saw first hand the good work that can be achieved without regulation. If you think that more fire protection would be good for UK businesses then you should be making your case to the business community, not to the government.

There is a line to be drawn and I want to send a clear signal that we in government are looking urgently at what we should stop doing and at what the sector can be expected to do for itself.

As I have said, it is about resetting the relationship. Looking at that line between central and national. If it makes sense for something to be handled at a national level that does not automatically mean that it needs to be driven centrally. The sector, by sharing good practice and agreeing on priorities should surely be able to drive much of this without our input.

I have talked about the future role of localism and the opportunity that a Big Society can bring. But what does this mean for the fire and rescue service? In taking on the brief as fire minister I have a duty to ask myself the hard questions about the modern fire service, and to ask them framed very much from a localist perspective.

I want to know how government and the service can deliver differently, more locally? I want to ask if there is a role for social enterprises or the voluntary sector? I want to ask if there is a role for business? I want to ask if we can pass power and funding down to communities?

I want to ask to what extent does central government have to be involved directly in the running of the fire and rescue service? I want to be clear about what needs to be done at the national level - where does the national interest lie? Assurance over response to national emergencies and resilience seems sensible but is that where the national interest in the fire and rescue service stops? I need your help to answer and ask these questions.

This is why I am proposing my department to seek out your best ideas, your new thinking and your experience to join me in a strategic review of the sector, government's role in it and the future of the service, including whether or not we need a National Framework. I call on you today to put forward your best thinkers to work with me on this review. I will be asking my officials to pursue this with you as a matter of priority.

There are challenges ahead, including those posed by funding, but let me be clear, now more then ever there is a need for strong collective leadership by the service.

It is time for the sector to step up and seize the opportunities that are coming your way. Don't wait around for us to tell you what to do. My advice is to never do tomorrow what you can do today. I recognise that the fire and rescue service has come a long way but it now needs to prove that it can be bold and innovative.

### Meeting those challenges?

There is no disguising that things are going to be challenging, there are hard times ahead, but as I have said none of us came into public service for an easy ride.

We do recognise the challenges that lie ahead in delivering local services at a time when we face the worst financial deficit seen in decades. This will require a different way of doing things than we may have been used to previously.

The big question you will need to address is how you will deal with the changing environment. I believe there is significant scope to find efficiencies in the way you deliver services. And not to put too fine a point upon it, to deliver on savings will mean doing more for less, or in some cases stopping activity which no longer needs to be done.

It's not just about value for money - that's old news, its nothing special and it is what everyone should do all the time. But it is about looking at your ways of working.

You may wish to consider radical approaches such as flexible staffing with changes to shift and crewing systems, shared services or back office functions or even voluntary mergers at operational level.

Or you may wish to look at management of the more process type functions such as improved sickness management or improved procurement. These will be your choices and your decisions.

But none of these suggestions will be dictated by central government, and I can assure you we will not be providing your answers either.

These are your challenges and your decisions, not just as individual fire and rescue authorities and services, but collectively, as a professional organisation.

### FiReControl

And finally I come to the major challenge for us all - FiReControl. I hesitate to say ""what you have all been waiting for"" because that couldn't sum up the position better!

This project has been a catalogue of delays, poor delivery and added costs. You all know its history - and I am not going to waste time today by going over it yet again.

The basic concept of FiReControl - a resilient national network of control centres, delivering modernisation and efficiencies - is sound. Control operators and fire services should be able to work together across the country, with modern shared technology, especially at busy times. Many people would be surprised that they cannot now.

But so far we have seen very little of the main system delivered. So let us focus on the three delivery basics.

The project must be delivered to time. Both the Government and the main contractor EADS have given a clear public commitments on delivery. Now is the time to keep to those commitments. We cannot have more uncertainty and broken promises.

The project must be delivered to cost. I have already said clearly that the fire community has to face its share of cuts and efficiencies. These are tough times for public spending. Throwing more money at this project, from some bottomless pit of public expenditure, can no longer be the answer or the safety net when it hits problems. That would be totally unacceptable.

And third, the project must be delivered to quality. The fire and rescue service has been promised a system that is generally better - and at least as good as - their existing systems. The capability, resilience and performance of the new system must meet that promise. There cannot be any corner cutting. Nothing less will do.

Finally, I need to be satisfied that these three basics are achievable. As you know, the government is currently reviewing all major projects - and FiReControl is one of them. That is a timely and important step in making sure we can achieve what I have set out today - and the process must run its course as soon as possible.

I know this has been a long and frustrating business. Many of you have supported the objectives of FiReControl over many years and given your time and expertise. But have waited - and waited - to see the end product. That cannot go on.

However, you are also well aware that it is a very complex project with a history. Along the way the - many - Fire Ministers have made unhelpful announcements which have benefited nobody. I am not going to do that today - however much you would like me to!

We all want clarity and certainty on this project. And one thing is certain - both I and the Secretary of State Eric Pickles will carefully consider every aspect of FiReControl with a view to ensuring there is a clear outcome. Then we can be confident of a way forward that best supports local fire and rescue services in doing their vital job in local communities.

I must emphasise that we expect EADS to deliver what the fire and rescue services need. But, as is only sensible, if necessary - and as recommended by the Select Committee - we will talk to the fire service community about a contingency plan.

### Conclusion

Today I have set out my agenda and aims for the sector. The fire and rescue service has undergone a period of unprecedented change and challenge over recent years and it has risen to these challenges admirably.

However we are now facing a new period of change, challenge and opportunity.

It's time to reset the relationship, the day of the Big Society and Localism is here.

It is time to look at doing more for less. More power, less money.

It is time to step up and take the responsibility for your sector.

And it is time to put Firecontrol onto a sound and stable footing.

I have great expectations that the fire and rescue service will rise to these challenges with all the energy and enthusiasm that it has previously shown.

There is a lot of work to do and now is the time to do it.

Thank you.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/articles/newsroom/2039123,"Let's talk, not strike","* * *

I understand that people are concerned about the implications of pension reform in Local Government. Reform has become inevitable because people are living longer - so it is only fair that people work for a bit longer before drawing their pension. The taxpayer can't foot the whole bill and the Local Government Pension Scheme cannot be exempt from the process.

However, I can reassure local government workers that we want you to continue to have access to pensions that are among the very best available. Yes, the Local Government Pension Scheme investment balance sheet is sustainable but it has become off balance elsewhere. In the past 15 years the cost of town hall pensions in England to taxpayers has risen four-fold to over £6 billion a year and it is continuing to rise, year on year, putting pressure on frontline services and council tax.

Lord Hutton's review has been instrumental, not only in addressing how to make short term savings fairly, but how to make public pensions sustainable for both the taxpayer and workers over the long term. A reformed pension system, affordable and fair to taxpayers and members alike, is reasonable.

Discussions between the Local Government Association and unions were not as productive as they might have been, so we put an offer on the table. But that does not mean discussions are over. Most union members did not vote for to strike. Only a third backed industrial action. The public will judge widespread or disruptive union action on the 30 November 2011 as unnecessary and unacceptable. While discussions continue union bosses demands are unreasonable.  
   
Three things are certain. First, people are collecting their pension for longer making reforms that reduce the taxpayer burden essential. People working for ordinary businesses all over the country are facing tough times and yet union bosses want a walk out that will hurt the economy to the tune of half a billion pounds and in return for this gesture they expect the public to pay even more in taxes.

Second, we've listened and responded. The new offer was a very big move. Generous by any standards and a pension most people in the private sector can only dream of receiving. Public sector workers will continue to get a guaranteed benefit in retirement and a more generous 'accrual rate' and crucially those within 10 years of pension age will be protected and stay within their existing arrangements. We are a reasonable government on the side of reasonable people offering reasonable reforms.

And third, the [local government pension scheme offer](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/local/pensions/pensionsreform/) is the best on the table. Depending on what option is agreed it could mean over a million workers, 70 per cent of scheme members, pay no more than a 1.4 per cent more, with 300,000 full time employees, those earning under £15,000 paying no increase whatsoever.

I want to re-assure any Local Government Pension Scheme members reading this the reforms won't impact on the value of the pension income they receive at retirement. Many low and middle income earners would actually receive a larger pension income. Final salary pension pots already built up will be protected, and people will still receive guaranteed, inflation proofed, benefits in retirement. With so many workers still set to receive a good pension, taking to the streets isn't a reasonable response.

The victims of industrial action will be the taxpayers who pay public sector wages - the ordinary people of Britain. The real effort should be on coming together to reach an agreement. That's the reasonable course of action.

I am today publishing a paper which sets out the next steps in the Government's reform of the social housing system, in light of the responses we have received to our policy document, _Local decisions: a fairer future for social housing_, published in November last year. The paper which I am publishing today also contains a summary of those responses.

The reforms to social housing which are being taken forward in the Localism Bill will give local authorities far greater freedom and flexibility in the types of tenancies they can grant to social housing tenants; in the way they allocate their social housing; and in how they discharge their main homelessness duty. The reforms will also significantly improve mobility for social tenants. The reforms to tenure will only affect new social tenancies. We will ensure that the security and rights of existing social tenants continue to be protected in law.

I am publishing the response earlier than the usual 3 month deadline from the end of consultation as I believe it will be useful to inform debate on the social housing provisions in the Bill.

The response to the consultation was overwhelming. Nearly 700 responses were received from individuals and organisations. There was a very strong response from local authorities and other social landlords who, in the main, welcomed the new freedoms and flexibilities which the Government is giving them.

The Localism Bill will give the Secretary of State the power to issue a Direction to the Regulator of Social Housing on a Tenancy Standard and a Direction on Mobility. I am taking the opportunity presented through the paper I am publishing today to set out the Government's thinking on what we believe should be contained in both of these Directions. I intend to publish a full technical draft of the Directions on Tenure and Mobility later this year, when they will be subject to a full consultation.

The Government has today launched a consultation, 'What can a mayor do for your city?'. We are asking local communities to contribute their views on the powers that directly elected mayors should be able to exercise in the 12 largest English cities outside London.

The Government is committed to helping all of England's cities thrive. Experience from London, and from other towns and cities in Europe and beyond, shows that directly elected mayors can provide strong and visible leadership, increase accountability for local decisions, enhance their city's prestige and maximise the potential for local economic growth.

In the Coalition Agreement, the Government committed to creating directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Leicester has already elected a city mayor. The Government is now planning referendums in 11 other cities - Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield - to take place in May 2012. Where local people vote in favour, these cities will move to a directly elected mayor.

The Government starts from the assumption that each of our cities is unique, facing challenges and opportunities shaped by its history and location. We think city mayors will be able to do their job best when their remit and powers properly match local circumstances.

Rather than simply seeking to impose a ""one size fits all"" approach, then, we think cities themselves should have a strong say over how mayors can help their city thrive. With this consultation, we are inviting contributions from the people who live and work in the 12 cities on which powers they believe a city mayor, where elected, should be able to exercise on their behalf.

This approach is in line with the Government's commitment to localism, and to the ongoing success of England's cities.

I am placing copies of the consultation document in the Library of the House.

On 1 November 2011 The Government launched a consultation, ""What can a mayor do for your city?"", asking local communities to contribute their views on the powers that directly elected mayors should be able to exercise in the 12 largest English cities outside London - Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield.

That consultation concluded on 3 January 2012, and I am today announcing our response.

In our consultation, we proposed that rather than seeking to impose a ""one size fits all"" approach, there should be a bespoke approach. Section 15 of the Localism Act provides for powers to be devolved to authorities subject to the approval of parliament. Where a mayor is elected we would expect that mayor to come forward with his or her own request for the powers they seek to take.

In parallel with this consultation we have also begun to negotiate with cities and their local enterprise partnerships bespoke city deals to support economic growth in their area.

The responses we have received to our consultation reinforce the view we have taken that a bespoke city-by-city approach to the decentralisation of powers is the right way forward.

Accordingly, where any mayors are elected in the 12 cities we will continue the bespoke approach to devolving powers that we are already pursuing in the context of city deals, but with the mayors themselves having an important role in the process of decentralising powers.

_Draft speaking notes - may differ from the delivered version._

This Government came to power with a different view of how to create the conditions for economic growth.

I didn't really have an enduring belief that regional strategies, and targets imposed from on high, were the answer.

We believe in local power, matched by local responsibility.

I think the thing that's most exciting about local enterprise partnerships is that there is no preconceived pattern. Philip Hammond's earlier announcement supports this approach.  
   
It's an unprecedented opportunity for local leaders to take choices and to make decisions.

To create jobs for local people. To attract investment.

This is one of those points in history where individuals really can have a chance to make their mark. Nothing is prescribed. Just get on with it and see how fast you can go. Perhaps go so fast that government has to catch up with you.

Your leadership and determination will make the difference between whether these partnerships fly - or falter.

It's hugely to the credit of the partnerships that you have got off to such a strong start. And I know that much of that has been showcased today.

At this point I would like to thank David for the work he has done in leading the Network and bringing everyone together today.

Businesses and councillors have brought enthusiasm and commitment and hard work to the task. Producing a strategy document in one and a half days, producing a 'to do' list that is only one page long.

Many business people have chosen to step away from more lucrative roles to do this.

In fact, the cast of the boards across the country would make many a blue-chip green with envy.

Some worried that local leaders wouldn't be able to cope without a guide book.

I'm delighted that you're proving the doubters wrong.

We've seen high ambition and real creative thought.

The Black Country showing opportunities to invest.

Coventry and Warwickshire are working with banks to help small firms access finance.

Enterprise M3 are cutting away the red tape on apprenticeships.

York and North Yorkshire are developing an accreditation for young entrepreneurs - boosting their skills, and giving banks greater confidence to lend.

New Anglia are sowing the seeds of green industries.

Cumbria are working to spread high-speed broadband to rural areas.

And Sheffield have brought together all the local planning authorities to agree a customer-friendly service and a timely process for planning applications.

You also heard also from the West of England, Cumbria and Cheshire in Warrington this morning. And there is much more - partnerships are off to a flying start.

The other week a Spectator editorial argued that ""the West emerged as the world's centre of power because it had hundreds of small countries competing with each other.""

To put it simply; I don't think there's anything wrong with a little sibling rivalry.

The element of competition can spark new ideas. Motivate everyone to work a bit harder. And help different places learn from each other, adapting the best ideas from other places while pioneering their own. I'm pleased that this work has already started between you today. Have no shame - steal some of the best ideas from others in the room.

Partnerships have also of course played an essential role in preparing bids for Enterprise Zones.

We've been absolutely clear that these Zones must foster new investment and jobs - not merely displace them.

Go where there is real potential for growth in the future - not simply because it's a tad sluggish today.

So, do you focus on the dog-eared retail park - or focus on something like the promising science centre?

The business view has been critical in helping make these very tough decisions.

Today, the Government is ready to help all those places who made successful bids bring their Enterprise Zones to life.

But those of you who missed out should keep aiming high.

In many cases there will be elements that can be put in place without the need for a zone.

So if the plans for the zone were based on simplifying local planning rules - do it. You have the powers to do so.

If it was about drawing in foreign investment - well just reach out.

Looking ahead, Government is ready to work with every area to help create jobs and drive growth.

I know that many of you have started this work already and have designated Enterprise Areas and Growth Zones. I have already seen a number of chairmen of partnerships, ready, willing and able to do just that.  
   
This first year has been a year of setting goals and defining ambitions.

The next year has to be more and more about turning ambition into results.

In a year's time, let's see entrepreneurs leaving banks with cash in their pockets. Green industries drawing down seed funding. Local firms getting planning decisions in good time, every time.

And everyone, everywhere, should be ambitious about where they go from here.

I know that you're already thinking about what more you can do.

Some are focussing on strategic planning - joining forces to finance the new infrastructure, roads and rail that will lay the foundations for growth.

Some are focussing on attracting investment for the long term.

Others want to develop the new skills that will be needed for the hi-tech and green industries of the future.

In many cases, partnerships will get on and put those plans in train.

But there should be no doubt:

Whatever is in their power to do, they should go ahead and do it.

Don't wait for permission.

In other cases partnerships will need Government to do things differently if they are to achieve their ambitions.

They may want greater control over budgets.

Greater flexibility about regulation.

Whatever their request - Government is ready to listen.

There is no limit to what partnerships might want to propose but their own imagination and ambition.

Nothing is off the table. I believe Greg Clark said something similar this morning.

I cannot guarantee that Government will always give partnerships what they want.

But you have my word that we will give every reasonable proposal proper consideration and a timely answer.

And as we shape new policy, I want to make sure that we're giving local leaders headroom and flexibility to take more decisions.

In our proposals for repatriating business rates, we are leaving the door open for councils and partnerships to work together - they might want to share the benefits of growth, smooth out peaks and troughs between different areas.

And our proposal for a streamlined planning policy reaffirms that councils must play a key role in shaping the future of their communities - not just waiting for growth to happen, but seeking out opportunities for responsible, sustainable development.

On planning, by the way, if you have a view on our proposals - and it might not have escaped your attention that there's been considerable interest in our reforms - you have until October to comment.

Don't leave it to others to comment. It has been a remarkable journey - without shifting an apostrophe or changing a word, this has changed overnight from being seen as a NIMBY's charter to the spawn of the devil without even a dignified mid-point.

Let me be clear - planning is the single biggest drag anchor on growth and we must deliver reform.

In many senses, what happens next is in your hands.

It's up to local leaders to decide what they want to make of their new freedoms.

The extent to which they use them is a test of their readiness to lead.

Your expertise, your appetite for growth, and your ambition to create jobs and to draw investment, are what makes the difference.

I found the rapid way that local enterprise partnerships have grown has genuinely surprised me. We have talked for some time about working with businesses. Now we are going beyond consulting and giving business a seat at the table.

At such a critical time, you can play a key role in making a difference for your neighbours, friends, children, grandchildren. You have a rare opportunity here. Don't look over your shoulder - just get on with what you are doing.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,London,,,,15-Sep-2011,supporting-economic-growth-through-local-enterprise-partnerships-and-enterprise-zones,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

First, thank you to David and the Network for the work they've done in the past year.

It's great to be here.

We're here in Royal Mint Court.

But it's a pity the money isn't here.

Actually, the Cabinet went on a visit to the actual Mint in Wales where we watched them mint coins for the Olympics.

They told us that normally they would check our pockets for change in case we planned to walk off with any Olympics coins!

But since we were the Cabinet they'd let us off.

Well, if anyone would like a few Olympics coins I'm ready to cut a reasonable deal!

Now the health of the economy, just like the health of the body depends on good circulation. I know that Bob in his presentation this morning set out the scale of the challenge.

For our currency it must flow to every corner of the United Kingdom.

As that great Elizabethan Sir Francis Bacon once said:

> ""Money is like muck, not good except it be spread.""

That means giving local areas the means to prosper.

We used to be good at this in days gone by.

The industrial revolution was forged, not in the corridors of Whitehall, but the crucible of our local communities.

Arkwright's first cotton mill in Derbyshire.

Spinning and textiles in Lancashire.

Iron in Shropshire.

What a great time it must have been with those pioneers.

An age where competition between local areas sparked ideas and imagination.

Shaping and remaking our country into the world's workshop.

But over the past hundred years or so we've seen Big Government in revolt (or revolting Big Government).

The dead hand clawing back power and resource from any innovation that moved.

Government following after Government but the computer still saying no.

The vast barrier of bureaucracy blocking up the system.

So with local enterprise partnerships we've gone back to first principles.

Giving localities a real stake in the performance of their own economies.

Creating self-sustaining economies with local led growth.

Working hand in glove with the private sector.

Giving back not just political but economic power to local people.

You can see where local enterprise partnerships fit into the picture.

In a way, you're leading the charge.

So two years on from your creation what's happened?

From what I can see - plenty.

You've seized the initiative and demonstrated local leadership over the Growing Places Fund.

That's where we'd like the future to be.

The way these decisions used to be made was through civil servants and scoring systems.

Ministers made decisions at the end of the process.

Now we're saying there's a better way of doing it.

We're giving you the power to get on with the job.

To put money into local growth and local infrastructure.

And that's what's happening.

The Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership Board recently approved £11.5m for a range of projects that will bring a hospital, housing, offices and green spaces to the area.

Not to mention a new stage for Elstree Studios - which brought us _Star Wars_ and _Indiana Jones_.

In total we're talking about 4,000 new jobs and 2,000 new homes by the time these projects are completed.

Meanwhile, the South East partnership has already identified 10 projects with planning consent to receive £33m and create 28,000 jobs and 14,000 new homes.

And now, over in Lancashire, they've approved three schemes which are ready to start work immediately.

And as Justine set out earlier - you know how to get the best bang for your buck.

In layman's terms that means 1,550 new jobs, a further £95m investment just short of 600 new jobs.

I'd like to give a big hand to all those private sector lenders who've given their time to the enterprise cause.

Your efforts are paying off.

And what's so encouraging is the way that different areas are spurring each other on.

Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership decided to encourage 100 companies to recruit 100 new apprentices in 100 days.

But anything they can do Leeds can do better.

The Leeds City Region Local Enterprise Partnership is aiming to get 1,000 companies to sign up to its 5-3-1 initiative.

It brings skills, education, mentoring, work placements and apprenticeships to a local area.

And I'll bet there's someone here thinking a thousand? Only a thousand? I can do better than that.

And, speaking as a Bradford man, I'm sure there's even someone who can put one over on Leeds.

By all means do so.

I've no problem whatsoever with a bit of sibling rivalry.

Local people will be the winners.

But since we're talking rewards let's focus on the crown jewels.

I'm referring, of course, to our Enterprise Zones.

Nothing quite says we're open for business than these hot houses of growth.

When I last looked there were 24.

From Hull to Hereford, Sheffield to the Solent.

All with simplified planning rules, and 100 per cent relief for all new firms over five years and to be kitted out with super fast broadband.

And these tax breaks begin the moment a business moves onto the site.

We've a zone in the Humber that could bring in more than 20,000 new jobs.

There's one in Tees Valley too.

Helping us keep our place as a world leader in renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and digital sectors.

Not to mention supporting up to 1,200 jobs by 2015.

I could go on all day but now's maybe not the time to pat yourselves on the back.

We've a job to do.

This is just the beginning.

To go further faster we need to tear down the culture of delay in local government circles that's paralysed action and growth.

As I said last time I was here, I'm fed up with local organisations waiting for my permission to act.

Don't be shy.

Don't put your hand up.

Don't faff about.

Just get on with it.

What I've found particularly refreshing about our local enterprise partnerships is the way they're getting the public sector to just get on with it.

Take, for example, Local Development Orders.

They let local authorities grant automatic planning permission for certain developments such as new industrial buildings.

Removing the normal delay and costs of planning permission.

They give firms greater certainty.

Now I've no idea why only a handful were put in place in the seven years since they've been in place.

That's anyone's guess.

Never mind.

Our Enterprise Zones aren't backwards in coming forwards.

They're getting stuck in.

Two thirds of the Zones will have at least one of these orders in place by the summer.

Eighteen orders have already been agreed, eight more have got through the consultation, a further 40 are in the pipeline.

Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone has a nice collection of development orders on the mantelpiece.

Six at the last count.

And this hub of off shore wind farms, port logistics and engineering is putting its orders to good use.

Turning them into new buildings, extensions, roads, telecommunications and low carbon energy installations.

The other day I popped in to see one of the entrepreneurial companies who are benefiting from this.

SeaJacks build vessels for offshore wind farms in the North Sea.

No idea how they do it.

I'm just glad they've got the money to get on with it.

A few folk think that doing things locally loses out a bit in terms of global prestige.

I think that's stuff and nonsense.

They're helping us gain a slice of the global pie.

And it's not over egging it.

Look at global manufacturer X:Cel Superturn. It's rapidly expanding its operation into the Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone bringing £18 million with it.

Japanese logistics firm Vantec, a subsidiary of Nissan, recently became the first overseas company to invest £24 million in an Enterprise Zone - taking advantage of Sunderland's Enhanced Capital Allowances.

These examples I think prove a point.

That we need to give even more power to your elbow.

They're about reforming business rates.

Allowing local areas to keep the proceeds of the wealth they create instead of handing it back to central government.

We've published the National Planning Policy Framework.

Development will now get the green light unless the harm outweighs the economic benefits.

The framework is another example of our new approach.

We've taken 1,000 pages of planning regulation down to less than 50.

Given planning back to the population.

You've made the point about how difficult it can be to get things done.

Well, we're doing something about it.

Ensuring that local enterprise partnerships alongside local authorities can create decent developments.

Places where people can work and grow up.

But I am expecting to hear what's going well and what's getting in the way of you getting things done.

I understand today that you have shared stories of the good, bad and the ugly, for example: the good work that you have led to speed up planning locally.

Ursula (Ursula Lidbetter - Chair, Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership) - I would like to hear more about what you have done to get planners and developers to agree investment.

Denys (Denys Shortt - Chair, Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership) - I know that my officials - including Bob - worked with you and transport officials to unlock a key development.

Alex (Alex Pratt - Chair, Buckinghamshire Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership) - you have secured private sector resource to support the Buckinghamshire Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership. I would be interested in hearing what the local authorities are also doing to support you.

But we must go further and faster - the scale of the challenge is significant.

I heard today that because of local authority processes, one area took four months to procure a website.

It would have been cheaper and easier to have trained a pigeon!

Anything that takes four months to procure, tells you there is something wrong with the procurement process.

That it's not fit for purpose.

Generally these processes are put together by people who don't understand the problem.

Who are only interested in making sure nothing goes wrong.

It doesn't matter to them.

But don't be seduced.

You're here to name and shame.

Let me let you into a secret.

We took a risk when we set up the local enterprise partnerships.

It was against the normal way they do things from the centre.

And it's basically because we didn't want you to mimic or copy what had gone before.

We wanted you to bring that private sector vitality to the party.

To encourage local authorities to share.

To deliver the growth that makes a difference to our local communities.

I bet there are a few local organisations out there right now with their noses out of joint, uncomfortable with the way you're pushing the boundaries.

I'd like to give you a considered view.

Good.

You're clearly doing something right.

And if there's anyone who is refusing to play ball and help you to help your local communities let me know.

For instance, if there are local authorities out there that are refusing to pool their resources to support their partnership, I'll be expecting answers - pretty quickly.

So don't be shy.

If you see rules break them.

If there are obstacles - go through them.

Otherwise the dead hand of Government will come up from the grave and pull you all down.

So take liberties.

Tell us what you need to make progress.

We all share the determination to act on behalf of our local communities, our local heartlands.

It's that that will help the money flow and the economy grow to the benefit of all.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Royal Mint Court, London",,,,26-Apr-2012,supporting-economic-growth-through-local-enterprise-partnerships-and-enterprise-zones,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Early into the new coalition, we find ourselves facing tough choices around funding, which need to be balanced with the protection of front line services.

But a better, more ambitious future is possible. Because these challenges are not mere problems - they're a mandate for change - genuinely radical change.

What does this change involve? The title of this conference asks if it means new power for local government. Yes, it does (there's no question-mark needed at the end of that phrase!).

But it means deeper change than that. It's got to be about the things we need to do collectively to produce what we've called the Big Society. A strong society, where individuals, families and communities are more able to take on responsibility to improve their lives.

It will mean three things:

  * new powers transferred to but also beyond local government
  * new freedoms for local government to get on with serving its citizens; and
  * a new political culture, where we move away from the state - and especially government ministers - usurping the responsibility of families and local leaders. 

### What next

We want to hand more choice and more freedom back to local authorities, and the communities they represent. Activity should take place at most local level possible, to give people control and a real say in what happens in their area.

And you know better than anyone the current state of play on voter behaviour and satisfaction with services:

  * barely a third of people bothering to vote in local elections
  * fewer than half of people satisfied with their council
  * only 33 per cent of people think their local council provides value for money
  * and councils are less popular than dentists!

This has got to change. The balance of power between central and local government needs to be reset. It's time to build a new system around our trust in people and professionals, and to stress the importance of the democratic mandate.

One month in, we've already put a decent down-payment on that promise:

  * ending of CAA
  * abolition of Home Information Packs
  * handing back of powers to councils over garden grabbing and housing densities
  * signalled our intentions around the scrapping of undemocratic regional strategies, regional assemblies and bins taxes
  * started to de-ring-fence more grants to give more local discretion over funding - with more to come
  * abolition of the Standards Board for England, whilst ensuring that Councillors will remain answerable to their electorate
  * we have introduced a Bill to stop the restructuring of councils in Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk. This will save the taxpayer £40million in unnecessary restructuring costs.

This is just the start. We've said in the Coalition Agreement that we will ""promote a radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local government and community groups"". We want to make sure that we treat Local Government like grown-ups rather than insisting that a nanny state knows best.

And we mean it:

  * new incentives so local communities benefit directly from business and housing growth
  * a review of local government finance
  * freedom for councils to decide their own structures
  * building on the Sustainable Communities Act
  * directly elected mayors with additional powers for the biggest cities
  * we will work with local government to deliver a council tax freeze in 2011-12 while protecting vital local services
  * and, of course, a general power of competence.

So, as Eric Pickles said the other day, all this means that there has never been a better time to be involved in local government. Our government will ensure - is already ensuring - that you get the extra freedoms and extra powers you need.

Much of this will be done through our planned Localism Bill to devolve greater powers to councils and neighbourhoods and give local communities control over housing and planning decisions. It will help set the foundations for the Big Society by radically transforming the relationships between central government, local government, communities and individuals.

The changes that will at last mean that there will be clearer accountability to the people you serve.

But I want to end on the most important point of all. We've got to use this opportunity to usher in not just a shift of power but of culture.

We'll know we've been successful when it has become routine for local citizens - and for that matter the national media - to turn to locally-elected leaders for answers rather than the despatch box in Westminster. We want local deliverers to be much more accountable to the people they serve rather than focussing on Whitehall.

And that means decentralising from Whitehall through the town hall, starting with individuals, families, communities and voluntary groups.

Asking those hard questions about whether we can shift power more directly into people's hands before we assume the state has the answer to their problems.

Because in the end, it's not really a matter of the centre letting go or councils taking the lead.  It's not just a question of how much power can be shifted.

There may be sceptics who think that we're not serious or that this can't be done. We've already shown that we are deadly serious about localism. And we've proved how much can be done even in just a short time. With your help, there's a lot more to be done.

So, together, let's rewrite the rules.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,London,,,,22-Jun-2010,giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area,giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The coalition programme sets out this Government's commitment to ending the era of top-down Government and giving new powers to local authorities to work for their communities, accountable to local people rather than central Government. In support of this approach, today I am announcing changes to local area agreements (LAA) reward grant and the national indicator set. These changes, alongside our previous decision to end the comprehensive area assessment, mark the end of the old, top-down local performance framework. I am also announcing a less burdensome approach to the way local authorities provide data to central Government.

From today, the Government are putting local areas fully in control of their local area agreements. This enables local authorities and their partners to amend or drop any of the current 4,700 LAA targets without needing ministerial agreement. Where they choose to keep the targets, central Government will have no role in monitoring them. I will also not be requiring local authorities to prepare an LAA from April 2011, once the current agreements expire.

I will not be making any payments for performance reward grant for the current LAA targets. Deficit reduction and ensuring economic recovery are the most pressing issues facing Britain today, and of course local government has to take its share of the cuts. My aim is to give local authorities the flexibility they need to protect key services, by removing ring-fences around their money, scrapping comprehensive area assessments (CAA) and getting rid of unnecessary top-down targets and their related bureaucracy.

I am also announcing today the replacement of the national indicator set with a single, comprehensive list of all the data we expect local government to provide to central Government. While in the past, local authorities were required to report against a headline figure of around 200 national indicators, we know that in reality the number of reporting requirements was far higher. My aim is to make the data requirements we place on local government transparent and to review and reduce this for April 2011. I will involve local government in this review, to help us ensure the list contains only the minimum of central Government data needs. We will also keep the sector informed over the coming weeks about when individual data collections can cease, as we make the transition to the single list. We will also work with the sector to develop a process to review the list on an annual basis. Once the list is in place, my commitment to local government will be that if a data requirement is not on the list they will be under no obligation to collect and provide it.

In future, the emphasis needs to be on local authorities being democratically accountable to local people rather than to central bureaucratic systems. That is why I am encouraging local authorities wherever possible to make their performance data accessible to their citizens.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,13-Oct-2010,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Let me start by thanking Baroness Margaret Eaton for her forthright, constructive, tenacious leadership on behalf of local government over the past three years.

I welcome Sir Merrick Cockell to his new role. Merrick, everyone here will be familiar with your remarkable achievements as leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and I look forward to working with you in the months to come.

And let me say it is a privilege and an honour that Lady Bruce-Lockhart is here today, whose late husband was instrumental in making this organisation what it is today, and shaping the legacy that Merrick is now taking on.

A year ago, the Coalition Agreement - building on the manifestos of the two coalition partners - pledged a shift of power from Westminster to the people.

We promised new powers to councils, communities, neighbourhoods and individuals.

It's been a year now and there can be no doubt; that shift has begun.

We are dismantling the command and control apparatus of the Whitehall state.

Comprehensive Area Assessment is gone. In turn, the Audit Commission will follow.

The National Indicator Set has been scrapped. The new Single Data List will further scale back the proliferation of data demands and stealth targets by Whitehall and its quangos.

The Government Offices for the Regions have closed their doors. The Regional Strategies and a whole tier of regional bureaucracy are going too.

The discredited Standards Board regime is winding up. New rights to stop the gold-plating of the predetermination rules will strengthen freedom of speech for councillors.

We're scaling back the interfering Best Value regime. And we will bring a General Power of Competence into force. No more will councils need to fill out Whitehall paperwork in triplicate for permission.

We're phasing out the ring-fencing of local government grants.

And as the Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday, the Government is embracing genuine fiscal devolution - letting councils keep the business rates they collect. Tax Incremental Financing will boost local regeneration and local development across the country.

This is a decisive, fundamental and irreversible change in England's political geography, one of the world's most centralised states. We are taking power away from Whitehall and putting it back in the hands of councillors and councils.

This first year is only a start. There is much more to do and much more to bed in.

Many of the reforms will be delivered upon the Localism Bill receiving Royal Assent, which should receive Royal Assent at the end of this year. A Local Government Finance Bill will follow to deliver on local retention of business rates and Tax Incremental Financing Powers.

An end to councils having to come to Whitehall with a begging bowl. Instead, you will have greater autonomy to plan and control your finances.

I believe as well we can change the culture and confidence of local government. When I was a council leader, I found you could only get more money for my area by talking it down. Stressing our weaknesses, not our strengths.

Local retention of business rates, in conjunction with the New Homes Bonus and a reformed Community Infrastructure Levy, will mean that councils will get more money for looking forward, not back.

Exploiting opportunity and growth and unleashing a new wave of municipal activism.

Local councils' place is at the very centre of growth.

Confidence within local government is growing with time.

I appreciate the Government's radical agenda and pace has been a challenge to some of our friends among the local government officers.

When abolishing regional planning, I was asked - what central guidance is being put in its place? We're aren't. It's called localism.

And we've been quizzed - what will be put in place of Local Area Agreements or the Place Survey?...It's called localism.

But what about statutory duties?

We have sought your help in building a clearer list of the statutory duties that Whitehall places on local government.

To some in local government, these duties are a comfort blanket. A justification for opposing change. A scary thing to look at.

The review - of which we are publishing a summary of responses in parliament today - is the first time in modern history that government has counted these duties.

Not to undermine frontline services, but as a way of attacking the foundations of Whitehall centralism from within Whitehall.

A single list itself will help put a stop to the insidious accumulation of statutory duties dumped bit by bit on councils.

Amazingly, half of all the current legal duties imposed on local government since the 1840s were imposed since 1997.

The inclusion of a duty on that list is not and never an indication that the Government was considering its removal.

The trade union Unison suggested that drawing up this list was proof we intended to abolish food safety, animal welfare, child protection, even the requirement for councils to bury the dead.

And we have said unequivocally that we would and will not remove statutory duties that protect vital frontline services.

But let's be reasonable…

Will the sky fall in without the statutory duty to produce a petition scheme?

Does local government need a statutory ""duty to promote democracy"" when we have these things called local elections?

Is it really right that councils should have to seek permission of the Secretary of State before erecting a statue?

We want to strip away needless red tape to let councils get on with what matters.

At the same time as we set local government free, we want to strengthen the role of individual councillors.

Councillors are the beating heart of the Town Hall.

The champion and the advocates of the communities who elected them.

So if councillors want to return to the Committee system, let them. There is no one-size fits-all model for local government.

But we should wake up to the fact that in many councils, scrutiny isn't working.

In licensing and health, councillors will have a stronger say to stand up for the interests of their local communities.

And on chief executive salaries, if a council wants to appoint staff on six-figure salaries, let the decision be taken in the full light of a public vote of Full Council - and then let councillors justify the decision to the press and public.

Councillors and monitoring officers now have to grapple with the latest missive from the Information Commissioner.

Councillors are being told to pay £35 a year to register as a data controller. If you don't pay, you face the threat of court, a criminal conviction, and an unlimited fine.

Clearly, councillors should respect data protection rules.

But we will be working with the Ministry of Justice to find a common sense solution, such as allowing councillors to be covered by their corporate council registration.

Councillors shouldn't have to pay £140 over their term of office to be allowed to reply to their constituents' letters.

This is nothing less than a tax on volunteering.

As a former councillor myself, I recognise the skills, the talent and the ingenuity of councillors and officials - especially in challenging financial times.

[Political content removed]

The interest on the national debt costs more than is raised from council tax, stamp duty and inheritance tax combined.

Local government accounts for a quarter of all public spending. We can't pay off this deficit unless every part of the public sector does its bit.

As we watch the daily uncertainty of our European neighbours with smaller deficits than ours, be in no doubt the tough decisions that you took with your council's budget made a big contribution to our county's stability and to our country's low interest rates.

The cost of Local Government Pension to taxpayers has trebled since 1997, to £6 billion a year. That's equivalent to £300 per household.

Without reform, in years to come, that cost will soar even more as our population ages. It needs reform. But reforms should be fair to employees as well as taxpayers. I want to publicly acknowledge the great help the Local Government Association has given in focusing in on the qualities of a well funded scheme. I am utterly convinced that we can arrive at something that protects the rights of council taxpayers, protects pensioners and ensures people remain in the scheme.

Despite tough fiscal times, there is still money to spend.

But unlike the implicit suggestion given by the BBC television programme, 'The Street That Cut Everything', local councils have £53 billion to spend this year.

We've cut the strings attached to allow you to decide how best to spend it.

And it's been heartening - over the past year - to see many town halls are getting things right.

There are five things I'd like to draw to your attention.

First, good councils are getting the basics right.

Seeking to deliver the very best services to local residents.

Emptying the bins. Cleaning the streets.

From Hackney to Reading - seeking not just to protect, but to strengthen their ties with the local charity, community and voluntary groups.

Second, the best councils are making prudent savings - while protecting the front line.

The fact is that there is scope, in many, places to do things more intelligently.

Tackling fraud.

Improving procurement.

Sharing services with neighbours could both save cash, and bump up standards - yet still only three in ten councils are doing it.

Getting more for less. The best show it can be done.

Like Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Westminster, well under way with their plans to bring services together, reducing costs and improving service standards.

Third, the best councils are driving local growth - recognising that a strong local economy is the basis of a strong local community.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the work of Local Enterprise Partnerships.

Like the councils in the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership - working with banks to get quick and easy access to finance for start-up industries.

Fourth, the best councils are thinking for the long term.

Seeing this moment where reform is vital not as a quick fix, but a chance to consider profound reform of services.

Community Budgets exemplify this approach.

If we could only get in there early - and bring services together - to reach the one hundred and twenty thousand families across the country who account for more than their fair share of unemployment, truancy, drugs, crime… we could make a lasting difference in these people's lives. And the lives of their communities.

So I salute the councils seeking to do just that.

Like Hull, forging links between youth crime programmes and support to adult offenders so that, where a whole family has a problem, the whole family gets support - not piecemeal bits and bobs.

And fifth, the best councils are throwing open their doors - becoming more transparent, more accessible and more responsive to the local people they serve.

Not just because it's the right thing to do - but because there is no better way of preventing waste and duplication.

Trafford have gone further still, creating a free application for the iPhone to make it easier and more convenient for residents to access council services on the go.

And Redbridge developed the online budget consultation tool 'YouChoose' to consult citizens on budget decisions.

Local transparency and open data will change the way we work. It undermines the raison d'etre for Whitehall inspection. Robust local accountability gives the political space to justify more devolution and more power for local government.

These examples - just a selection of the wide spread of best practice across the country - are proof of the ingenuity in our town halls.

The determination of councillors to deliver a better deal for residents.

And the talent and hard work of officials - like all those who took part in the Local Government challenge.

Yet, in the wake of an unsustainable legacy of government borrowing and debt, all of our communities face challenging times.

And though all of our public services need to deliver better results on tight budgets.

This is not the time to wring our hands.

It is the time for everyone in local government to look forward and be ambitious.

Our communities are looking to you to be their champions.

Making change happen.

Championing growth.

Making services work.

Championing the communities themselves.

And making their hard-earned council tax go as far it possible can.

So whether this is your first Local Government Association conference or you've been here for a few years: you couldn't have picked a more exciting time to take up the mantle.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Birmingham International Conference Centre, Birmingham",,,,30-Jun-2011,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/1866151,Local Government Association annual fire conference 2011: the future of fire,"* * *

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

Thank you for inviting me to be here today. The Fire and Rescue Service is at the heart of ensuring public safety and is critical to the UK's resilience against the risks of major incidents. I believe we have a fire and rescue service we can be proud of.

The Services' vital roles encompass not only your historic function in fighting fires but also responding to road traffic collisions, terrorism, floods and other emergencies, your hugely important prevention and protection function, and proven effective partnering with other local agencies in tackling the wider needs of communities.

I mentioned flooding and it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to mention Exercise Watermark which is happening this week and I am sure many of you will be involved in some capacity as I myself am.

### The Role of the Fire and Rescue Service

But when we look across the piece we can be in no doubt that the work which fire and rescue services do to protect and prevent loss of life and property within our communities makes a real difference. In England, we have a strong record in fire prevention, a record that we can be justifiably proud of.

The latest fire statistics are very encouraging indeed. Fire deaths in the home in England have halved since the 1980s: around 210 people have died in accidental dwelling fires in England over each of the past few years (2006/07-2009/10, England).

Of course, one fire death will always be one too many, but this is a terrific achievement, especially when you consider that we have an ageing population which continues to grow, leaving increasing numbers of people vulnerable to risk from fire due to age and infirmity.

We want to build on these achievements and fire prevention and community safety will remain at the core of our policy objectives.

For example, we recognise the immense value a properly maintained smoke alarms adds to life safety and are pleased to have been able to continue to run the Fire Kills campaign, to underpin and support local Fire and Rescue Service initiatives.

The introduction of fire safer cigarettes across Europe is an important example of this. We fully support the European Commission's efforts in developing a safety standard and test method for reduced ignition cigarettes and referencing this to ensure that, from November 2011 all cigarettes placed on the European market are compliant with this standard.

We estimate that this will save - with almost immediate effect - between 25 and 64 lives per year in England alone, and of course, many more across the whole of the Union. We are therefore committed to continuing constructive work with the UK tobacco manufacturers to ensure the necessary arrangements are in place to guarantee compliance with the new standard with effect from November this year.

But we must recognise that Government cannot - nor should attempt - do it all. We do not have the insight or expertise to develop and implement tailored interventions based on the specific needs or aspirations of your local communities.

That is why we are keen to maintain our partnership approach with local Fire and Rescue Services, and others engaged in delivering public safety, who are in many cases, much better placed to make the links necessary to deliver locally sustainable safety outcomes.

I encourage you all, particularly in these challenging times, to maintain your community safety focus, working together, and where effective sharing resources with other local agencies, to identify and target those within your communities who are most at risk from preventable fires.

It is not just at home where our Fire and Rescue Services make such an impact either. We have also seen great resilience in responding to international catastrophes such as the recent devastating earthquake in New Zealand. In response to requests from the New Zealand Government a UK International Search and Rescue team, of 61 personnel, including 56 Fire and Rescue Services staff and 5 medical personnel, with a range of specialist search and rescue equipment travelled to Christchurch to work alongside New Zealand Engineers and Medical Staff to locate and recover victims.

And just recently the Chief Fire and Rescue Advisor travelled to Iraq to meet with the Interior Minister, senior officers and fire-fighters to discuss safety following the devastating fire at the Soma Hotel in Suleymaniya where 34 people lost their lives.

So, as we look to the future, it is important that we recognise the range and depth of work undertaken by Fire and Rescue Services. It is greatly valued, and an exemplar of what responsive, safety focused public services are all about.

### Coalition Government Vision

However times are changing. In my first speech as the Fire and Rescue Minister back in Harrogate in June 2010 I talked of the need to reset the relationship between central and local government. I make no apology for making the same point again here today. If anything I am now even more convinced of this, and to make this happen we need to all play our part.

Just the other week the Prime Minister spoke of the Big Society - rebuilding responsibility and giving people more control over their lives. But he also said that it doesn't just apply in areas like volunteering. It's as relevant when it comes to public services and the decentralisation of power to the lowest possible level.

Government will soon publish a White Paper setting out our approach to public service reform, putting in place principles that will signal the end of the top-down, take-what-you're-given model of public services, dismantling Big Government and building the Big Society in its place.

Our ambition is to drive the transfer of power away from Whitehall to people and communities creating the conditions which energise and empower individuals, communities and businesses to build successful neighbourhoods. Public service decentralised and determined by users.

One word - Localism. I know that you will have heard me speak on this before and I have no doubt you will hear me speak on it again!

Through the Localism Bill central government is already putting in place means to remove barriers and give communities greater rights and powers of intervention. For example measures giving communities a right to buy assets and to veto excessive council tax rises.

Local Government will have a general power of competence so they can act in the interests of their communities with confidence. Standalone Fire and Rescue authorities will get comparable powers allowing them to carry out any activity as long as it is connected with any of their functions as a Fire and Rescue Authority.

We are freeing Fire and Rescue Authorities from bureaucracy, and want to go further. We want to free them from a focus on accounting to central government for local performance and priorities. Free them so that they can build on the work in their communities, to create a new and stronger relationship of influence and accountability with citizens.

As we free up Fire and Rescue Authorities I think it also helpful to say a few words here on the Government's wider regulatory policy.

In these difficult times, an important part of the Government's strategy for financial growth is to support business by adopting a deregulatory policy.

Regulation is therefore a last resort. This Government will not add to the regulatory burden unless it can be demonstrated to be the only option for delivering our policy objectives. Even in these limited circumstances, the introduction of the 'one-in-one-out' rule means that before any new regulation is introduced, the costs must be fully justified through an impact assessment and an existing regulatory burden must be identified and removed so that the overall amount of regulation does not increase.

Furthermore on Monday we announced a comprehensive review of the statutory duties placed on local authorities by central government. This is a further step in the drive to remove centrally imposed prescription and burdens and free councils up to meet the needs of their communities.

### Economic Environment and Funding

As we look to the future I am aware that I have already frequently touched on the economic challenge which is the backdrop against which we are all working.

Let me quickly recap - the unprecedented public sector deficit means that all layers of government have difficult decisions to make. I know fire professionals understand the role they have to play in helping to reduce the deficit, building a stronger and safer society, and sustainable Fire and Rescue Service; and I recognise that you are also dealing with a range of issues around the future of pay and pensions.

However, the fire and rescue service has been given some protection in the recent settlement. Overall, single purpose Fire and Rescue Authorities will see a reduction in revenue spending power, taking into account grants from central government and council tax, of 2.2 per cent in 2011-12 and 0.5 per cent in 2012-13.

To achieve this level of savings, the Fire and Rescue Service will need to increase efficiency and deliver reform. I know many of you have already started planning. However, as I have said before, I do believe these savings should be achievable without affecting the quality and breadth of frontline services, through increased efficiency in areas such as:

  * flexible staffing arrangements
  * improved sickness management
  * pay restraint and recruitment freezes
  * shared services/back office functions
  * improved procurement
  * sharing Chief Officers and other senior staff
  * voluntary amalgamations between Fire and Rescue Authorities. (For which a practical guide is available on our Department website.)

I am pleased to see that these efficiency themes have helped shape your conference and I am sure there will be some innovative ideas being shared. However as you look to make the savings needed it will of course be for you individually to decide how to make savings locally. You need to continue putting in place plans, and acting on them, for both short and long term.

I have heard concerns that counties are facing higher reductions than single-service authorities and plan to pass reductions onto fire in years one and two. Of course this is a local decision for County councils to determine - but I want to assure you that I am aware and have acted upon this.

I wrote out to county council leaders on the 17 January, setting out the  Government's aim, which is for Fire and Rescue Services to be given the time to implement changes such that reductions in the quality of front-line services can be avoided.  Reductions in funding for Fire and Rescue Services have been less than those applied to local authorities in general. We would therefore hope this is reflected in County Council budgets when they are set.

Capital grant funding has increased from £45m in 2010/11 to £70m in 2011-12. We announced 2010-11 allocations alongside the local Government Settlement to enable you to plan for the next year. The increased capital grant recognises the need for fire and rescue authorities to maintain their investment in capital assets and the potential for making efficiency savings at a time when resource budgets are under greater pressure.

At a time of reducing capital funding it is even more important that this funding is targeted to the areas that will deliver greatest value for money. That's why we are currently considering a number of options for distributing future years' capital funding, and will consult on the best way to focus capital funding to drive efficiencies and reform. I hope that some good ideas have come out of this key conference. For example, I would be interested to hear how strategic asset management plans are being used to drive through service delivery changes. Now is the time for innovative plans.

The Local Government Resource Review will consider options to enable councils to retain their locally-raised business rates.  Such an approach will help set free many local councils from dependency on central funding and provide incentives, through the business rates system, for them to promote economic growth.

The Review, which will deliver proposals by July this year, will consider how we could manage the distributional impacts of any new arrangements, including how to fund councils, such as Fire and Rescue authorities, which do not collect business rates.

On future funding, I recognises the importance of, and am committed to doing all I can to provide a clear picture of the resources that will be available beyond 2012/13 as soon as possible, subject to the review, but that the lack of clarity that exists at the moment should not prevent you from preparing for lower levels of funding.

Challenging times of change provide us with the impetus to seek out new opportunities and be innovative in the way we deliver for our communities and neighbourhoods.

### Fire and Rescue Service Future Vision

Strong local leadership is needed going forward giving full and transparent accountability back to the communities you serve  The Government's role is to work in partnership with you to set strategic direction, but you will need to take ownership of your own agenda and drive change within your ranks.

When I was appointed as the Minister for the Fire and Rescue Service I seized the opportunity to invite the wider Fire and Rescue Sector to undertake the Fire Futures review.

My intention from the outset was that Fire Futures should signal a new way of working - enabling those at the front line and behind the scenes to help set the agenda and tell government what is important in delivering it. I have been impressed by the energy and commitment of the entire sector in rising to this challenge.

Fire Futures is providing a successful and timely wide ranging review of Fire and Rescue Services as they stand, the challenges and opportunities ahead, and has offered a broad spectrum of ideas and proposals for the future.

We will be formally responding to the Fire Future reports shortly but as part of this, as I have said we need to reset the relationship - what is already clear is that we in Government want to enable change and decentralisation; we don't intend to impose or manage new ways of working from the centre.

My expectation is therefore that the majority of the ideas coming through Fire Futures are for the wider sector to take forward as it sees fit - indeed some activities have already been picked and run with by the sector - such as the Fire Community Forum.

There needs to be fully accountable local services with local responsibility for decisions and performance ensuring appropriate funding and empower change to deliver reform. There needs to be a clear framework for local services and local resilience with clarity between roles in local and national resilience.

As the Department now responsible for developing, implementing and managing resilience below the national level and supporting the delivery of national resilience in England we will be putting in place a new approach reflecting the shift of priorities brought about by the Coalition Government.

But, Let me be clear, the safety and security of our citizens is of paramount importance to Government and central to this is the role of the Fire and Rescue Service in delivering National Resilience. The Governments key interest will be in ensuring that there are robust arrangements in place. We will use the Fire Future response as an opportunity to begin our dialogue together on national resilience next steps.

### Future of Control Room Services

Of course we cannot ignore the closure of the FiReControl project in talking about national resilience.  As you know, last summer I gave the strongest possible message to the main IT contractor EADS that they must deliver to time, cost and quality.

However, as the weeks passed, it became clear that they could not deliver the project requirements to an acceptable timeframe. And in December we decided that enough was enough. That is history. But it does leave a question of whether a potential resilience deficit remains.

This is one of the questions we are asking in the current consultation on the future of fire and rescue control services - to which I hope you will all take the opportunity to respond. Are the original objectives of improved resilience, efficiency and technology available to fire and rescue services still valid, and how might we achieve them now?

I have said clearly that we will not be imposing a solution on fire and rescue authorities. And feedback so far suggests that technology upgrades you have already made, together with plans you are developing, will go some way to meeting that deficit.

Many are talking of closer collaboration and even sharing services - an increasingly common route in the wider local government landscape to achieve better and more efficient delivery.

It is a challenge - but these are challenging times. I am confident that you will take the opportunity to build resilience, efficiency and technological advance by choice, from the solid foundation of your experience and expertise - from the bottom up, rather than central government imposing unwanted solutions from the top down.

### Conclusion

We are in a period of unprecedented change. This is a potentially huge moment - a defining moment - a moment of real opportunity. If we are all to rise to these challenges, we can surely make the most progress by finding the common ground, listening and learning from each other.

It's time to reset the relationship and as a trusted and highly effective provider of critical services, your contribution cannot be underestimated.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Can I start by congratulating Dame Margaret and Sir Jeremy on their elevation to the peerage. Both of them are magnificent ambassadors for local government.

![Eric Pickles speaking at the LGA Conference (Copyright: Duncan Nicol Robertson/LGA)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1633526.jpg)Do you know, public borrowing is more than double the total grant that councils get from Government each year?

That means far more than just trimming a few budgets away.

If we don't get it right, Britain will be an economic laughing stock.

Future generations will be paying for our mistakes for decades.

Now, I'm under absolutely no illusions about the difficult challenges in local government.

But none of us went into public service to smell the roses and bask in perpetual sunshine.

There is a choice.

We can either assume that because government has no money, public services have to get worse. And accept an age of enforced, unthinking, austerity.

Or we can say, hang on a minute.

Did all that big government, all those billions of pounds of unsustainable spending, actually get things done?

Or is there a better way?

We could take this forced opportunity to shake up the way Britain works.

We could replace big government with the Big Society.

And we can make localism a reality.

Not because it's an economic necessity. But because it's the best way to get things done.

To run services, to build a stronger economy and a stronger society.

We do not need to be less ambitious, or less radical, just because we have less money.

Instead we will put people back in charge of their lives.

Put businesses and councils back in charge of economic growth.

Put town halls back in charge of local affairs.

That's what localism means.

For the first time in decades, councillors have the chance to take real decisions.

To get things done.

To genuinely make a difference.

You won't be strangled by central government or smothered by regional bureaucracy any more.

It's time to put things right.

The previous government did talk a good game.

But their actions spoke louder than words.

In one year, my immediate predecessor, the former Secretary of State managed to publish more than 1200 publications.

Like the 74 page guidance on filling in the 'handypersons financial benefits' form?

I think if you need 74 pages of guidance to fill in a form, there's something fundamentally wrong with the form.

I've got to accept some blame too.

I must admit, while I've been Secretary of State, there have been twenty more publications.

So I want to apologise, here and now, for those. And the extra, unnecessary burdens they've put on you.

That's not what I'm about.

In the past fifty days instead of writing guidance, I've been shredding it.

Instead of creating legislation, I've been dumping it.

You've been a prisoner of regulation, chained to the radiator with red tape, for too long.

I want to liberate you.

Focus on what really matters. Making localism a way of life.

So by the time the localism bill is introduced into Parliament, localism is already a fact. How are we doing it?

By taking powers away from bureaucrats and quangos and from me.

And restoring powers to communities and elected officials.

And I can announce today, as I promised to a fringe meeting here two years ago, we're also abolishing the TLA. The three letter abbreviation.

We've already scrapped the IPC, the CAA, the RDAs.

We've put an end to the centrally imposed, unwanted garden grabbing which blights so many communities.

The HIPs which tied up the housing market.

Instead we've given you control of the money.

You are now in charge of something like £38 billion every year, no strings attached.

And put you back in charge of the decisions which matter.

How you get the job done - improving standards and saving money - is down to you and your voters.

I don't presume that I know more than you do about how your area should be run.

You and your voters, should decide how you organise yourselves. Whether you want a mayor, a cabinet or a return to the committee system, I don't mind. That's up to you.

Nor do I believe that targets build homes.

So while I've already written to you to set out my intentions, I'm pleased to confirm that before I left for Bournemouth today, I laid before Parliament a statement revoking Regional Strategies with immediate effect.

You can finally get on with planning without being held to ransom by top-down targets.

As the Chancellor said last week, as a government;

> ""we want to change the incentives in planning so there are direct economic benefits for local communities.""

And my statement today talks about 'direct and substantial benefit.'

So people can say yes to new homes.

And new local housing trusts, with backing from the community, will be able to develop new homes, shops, and businesses themselves.

Those housing incentives are the other side of the ending of the regional spatial strategies.

Ideally, I would have liked to announce them together.

But I inherited a number of pending appeals. Given that I was not elected to implement the previous government's failed policy, it was important to announce the change quickly.

If I just wait around, it's a bit like saying I'm going to abolish the death penalty, but then saying, everyone on death row must be executed so that we can have a clean slate.

The country has a housing shortage.

But it's time to concentrate on building homes, rather than dreaming up numbers.

I always felt those regional spatial strategies would have fitted in nicely with the old Soviet Union. And the 'Nikita Khrushchev' style of management.

Back in the USSR, if tractor production fell in the Ukraine, Mr Khruschev would do two things.

First, he would pick up the phone and shout at the tractor producers.

Second, he would increase the target.

As a result, we've ended up with more disputes and fewer homes.

No reason for people to want new housing anywhere near them.

But starting today, power will be handed back to councils and communities.

So they can make their own decisions on planning and housing issues.

These are the sorts of big choices that you need to make. Housing. Planning. Public services.

But you need the time to make them.

So what I want to do is help clear your desks of all the other things that get in your way.

Last week, the Deputy Prime Minister launched his campaign to promote 'Your Freedom'. As Nick said;

> ""For too long new laws and regulations have taken away people's freedoms, interfered in everyday life, and made it difficult for businesses to get by.""

And I agree with Nick.

So it's time to get rid of all the absurdities which are still on the statute book for no reason.

Like the law from 1919 which says that when councils want to buy new land for allotments, I'm supposed to sign it off.

After all my years in politics, I finally get to choose who gets to grow carrots and who doesn't.

But there's a problem.

As Mrs Pickles will tell you, I'm not a dab hand with the trowel.

So what skills am I supposed to bring to this job?

What searching questions can I ask the applicants. How big are your marrows?

And there's a lot more where that came from.

We've got three different sets of regulation governing tree protection.

Who knows how many trees have been felled to write these.

Surely one would do.

And as for the guidance on 'the duty to carry out an economic assessment.'

Do you really need twenty pages saying you should know what's going on in the local economy?

Today, I'm saying, it's time for a 'bonfire of the inanities'.

Laws are supposed to protect people. Not smother them.

I've got a list of the sorts of things I want to ditch.

But I also want to hear from you. What barmy rules and regulations make your lives a misery?

Where-ever you can find 'outmoded, outdated and obsolete secondary legislation', just let me know.

We can dump it on the scrap heap together.

In return, I want to make something very clear.

Localism means much more than a tug of war of political power between Whitehall and the Town Halls.

It's a fundamental shake up of the balance of power in this country.

So power goes right back to the people who elected us.

People must have a genuine voice. A reason to get involved. A sense of responsibility for their neighbourhood.

They aren't going to get that if the only discussion about localism is between you and me.

So the relationship between councils and residents should change as much as the relationship between central and local government.

It's quid pro quo.

Instead of reporting to me, on the things I say are important to me: you should report to voters on the things they say are important to them.

For example, we're going to scrap the cap on council tax.

But instead, there'll be local referendums so people can decide for themselves if their council tax is too high.

We've ditched the CAA.

Because instead of telling me how you are performing, you should be telling voters.

There has got to be a new era of transparency, accountability and openness.

Now a few years ago, when myself and Mrs Pickles came down to Bournemouth, it was raining, so we went to the cinema. And we saw this film: Jerry Maguire, with Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr.

And they had a phrase that stuck.

'Show me the money'.

That's what we need to do.

Show the public the money.

That's why we've been encouraging you to put your spending online.

It's not for my benefit. It's so we get the information out there which will let the public make up its own mind.

Like the Prime Minister has said, we need to 'rip off that cloak of secrecy and extend transparency as far and as wide as possible'.

So that people no longer think government has something to hide.

And it's not limited to spending.

Putting jobs on the web - in a format anyone can re-use or re-publish - not only shows local people where their money is going.

It means they can question whether those jobs are really needed at all.

We've just heard about that 'cheerleading development officer' for example.

And really, how many transformation officers and business development directors does one council need?

I saw a council this week that was advertising for a 'communications waste strategy officer'. Well, that's someone who spins for bins, isn't it?

Do you really want a spin doctor? Or do you want someone to empty those bins? Do you really want somebody to tell the public why it is necessary for their chicken tikka masala to stay rotting in their bin for a fortnight? Or to employ officers who will get rid of it once a week?

But there are bigger questions for councils about justifying how they work to their voters.

In the case of education, is it really necessary to have separate education or separate social services departments.

These sorts of mergers could actually make services work together, across boundaries, much more effectively.

And it will free councillors to be focusing on what's happening within neighbourhoods.

Neighbourhoods are going to be key: they are the building blocks of public services society.

Now, over the past few weeks, it's been clear that there are various things we can learn from the German nation.

And various phrases have entered our language.

Deutschland vier, Argentinien null.

I want to add another one.

Doppelspitze.

It's one they came up with when starting their local government reorganisation.

And a question which we didn't address in the move towards executive members.

Doppelspitze means 'identical authority'. Where you have Chief Executives and elected leaders responsible for the same thing. It's both expensive and pointless.

Couldn't chief execs bring more to the table by working across boundaries, rather than replicating what the leader should be doing?

But I know, if I'm going to ask you to be more transparent and careful with money, it's only right that I set the pace.

Especially when it comes to procurement. And given what I've told you about sofas and love pods, it's clear central government has got a long way to go.

Let me tell you a story. Two major Departments - which I'll leave to your imagination - went to market on the same day for new electricity contracts.

They didn't speak to each other first.

Instead of combining their purchasing power to drive prices down, suppliers played them off against each other. Prices actually went up.

It's no laughing matter when taxpayers' money is going down the drain.

So I'm going to put my own house in order now. I'm embarrassed to look you in the eye and ask you to put all spending over £500 online if my own department is only putting spending over £25,000 online.

So CLG and its agencies will be putting all spending over £500 online too.

I want to lead from the front. And it might cause me some embarrassment, but it's the right thing to do.

I'll also be shortly be publishing the plan to shake up my own Department.

Previously it worked to make town halls deliver for Whitehall.

Now we want to free you to deliver for the public.

We're not going to be micromanaging, second guessing, and interfering in your affairs any more.

We're going to get on and let you get on with it.

What I can tell you is that you can expect to see much more of the same.

The same momentum and pace of change.

The same bold and radical steps.

And it's not just from me. My cabinet colleagues and I speak with one voice on this issue.

So you'll shortly be hearing more about how we'll be taking forward localism in the health service, including the important role for councils.

And about involving the voluntary and community sector too.

Now I have found in my first few weeks that the LGA has been an extremely constructive partner.

And I want to thank you for the comprehensive offer which you have made to the coalition government.

On behalf of the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, I'm delighted to accept your offer to find a better way for us all to do business.

The coalition government has brought about a realignment of UK politics and a new stability.

That stability can be used by you and me. To change the power structure. To change the constitution.

So I don't mind whether you are a Conservative councillor, a Labour councillor, a Liberal Democrat councillor, or an Independent councillor.

I want you and me to work together, to ensure that by the time we meet next year, power has shifted to the local base.

Thank you very much.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,Bournemouth International Centre,,,,6-Jul-2010,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

**Introduction**

Parliament is literally and metaphorically a place of divisions. Left versus right. Front bench versus back bench. Government versus opposition.

But when it really comes down to it, there are just two kinds of MP: those who have been councillors and those who haven't.

The first category has many advantages over the second. But in my experience there is one big disadvantage. And that is the culture shock. How can I describe it? The weight of responsibility. The privilege of power. The sense of being at the very centre of things. And then you throw it all away by becoming an MP for the first time.

If you ever wondered why some MPs are so desperate to attain ministerial office, it's because they want to regain what they once had in local government: the ability to act and not just represent.

In my role as Minister of State for Decentralisation, I'm sometimes told that councillors aren't up to the responsibility of power.

My reply is look at the job they're doing already. The services they run. The decisions they make. Compare their record on public sector efficiency with that of central government. And, then, tell me who's up to the job.

**II: This time is different  
**   
Of course, local government is not without its problems.But the most important of these is not of your making. It is the difficulty of doing your job in one of the most centralised countries in the western world.

I'm pleased to say that this is about to change. This is a government genuinely committed to decentralisation. I do, of course, understand why you might want to put our commitment to the test.

Past experience will have taught you that Westminster politicians are localists in opposition and centralists in government.

So, why should this time be different?

Here are five reasons:

  * Firstly, David Cameron didn't make decentralisation a theme of his election campaign, but the theme - in the form of the Big Society. Previous Prime Ministers had other priorities.
  * Secondly, the Big Society forms the basis of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, with a common commitment to localism forming the tightest bond between the two parties.
  * Thirdly, in the substantial shape of Eric Pickles, localism has a true champion around the Cabinet table.
  * Fourthly, we're already getting on with the job. We've abolished the ill-considered HIPS regime. We're abolishing the undemocratic IPC, which would have made unilateral planning decisions about some of this country's most significant planning projects. We've tackled garden-grabbing on so-called brown field sites. We've de-ring-fenced over £1 billion of local government spending, bringing the unfenced total this year to £38bn. We've scrapped the heavy burden of CAA. We've put an end to wasteful local government restructuring into centralised unitary authorities. Not bad for our first 50 days.
  * Fifthly, as announced in the Queen's speech, we will shortly introduce the Decentralisation and Localism Bill. This will be a landmark piece of legislation. Indeed, I challenge anyone to find anything on the statute book that transfers more power from central to local government than is the case with this Bill.

For all of these reasons I can say with some confidence that this is the localist moment, the greatest opportunity for decentralisation in decades.  
  
**III: The virtue of necessity**

I should also mention the small matter of necessity. As a Treasury minister in the former government recently made clear, there is no money left.

What central government does have plenty of, though, is power - and it is power, rather than money, that will be the main currency of redistribution for a long time to come

Decentralisation is what governments should do to stop wasting money.

Because, make no mistake, centralised government is wasteful.

According to a study for the European Central Bank, highly decentralised countries like the US, Australia, Japan and Switzerland are twenty per cent more efficient than we are.

But why should this be? Doesn't centralisation allow for cost control? Economies of scale? Consolidation, benchmarking and all the rest of it?

That is the theory; but in practice it doesn't work.

Researchers such as Professor John Seddon of Cardiff University Business School have developed a convincing academic account of what has gone wrong.  
But, essentially, it boils down to the fact that public services are about people, not things.

When management systems lose sight of this key fact, they lose touch with the enormous complexity of human situations, and therefore control of the services that are supposed to improve the lives involved.

Moreover, centralisation means a loss of cohesion between the different services that impact on the lives of the same individuals. When control is local, services can be joined up at the frontline. But when control is central, the focus is on hierarchy, on the chains-of-command that pull those different services in different directions.

We also see a loss of local knowledge. Even when the centre seeks to join-up public services, it starts with what it knows, which is the chain of command. This distracts attention from where services actually need to come together, which is the end-user. Needless to say, it is impossible for the centre to keep tabs on so many personal situations. Unfortunately, in recent years, we have seen repeated attempts to achieve just that by means of one disastrous IT project after another.

Finally, there is a loss of incentive. While people's problems can only be solved locally, when there are any savings they are usually clawed back by an undeserving and ungrateful centre.

For obvious reasons, the economy is the biggest challenge facing us right now. But we can't restore order to our finances without reforming the public sector, and we can't reform the public sector without decentralising control.

Localism, therefore, is of central importance.

**IV: Breaking the chains**

So how do we get from the present situation to one where local cohesion, knowledge and incentive is restored to running our public services?

It won't be easy.

Decentralisation is not one policy agenda, but many.

As well as the public service agenda, there is the planning agenda, the direct democracy agenda and other vital matters like local taxation, regional government and the role of the voluntary sector.

Take planning. On Tuesday we announced an end to regional planning strategies and the return of planning power to local councils.

The new system will be clear and efficient, replacing those dreaded central targets - for houses that never got built - with common-sense local decision-making, based on what people actually want.

Accompanying this - and as part of our pledge to cut down on bureaucracy - we have introduced a new 'light-touch' question and answer briefing for councils who need to meet the planning challenge.

Here it is - not quite pocket size, but not far off.

Compare that to what we have here - over 3,000 pages of various RSS documentation covering the South East region under the old system.

Brought to Bournemouth at considerable effort - but at no extra expense you'll be glad to hear.

For the metrically minded, that's 30 grams of q and a replacing 13.5 kg of prescriptive regional planning instructions. Light touch indeed!

Today CLG has joined the Department for Education in announcing structural reform plans that put localism at the heart of our thinking.

Over the next 18 months we will deliver radical transparency and decentralising reforms through a step-by-step blueprint for handing over power to town halls.

These will help local communities to take over the reins and deliver localism in practice - and in ways that they decide make sense to them.

Quite simply, we are re-booting Whitehall. We are prising the micromanager's fingers off the levers of control.

And let's be clear that this is not to be confused with the conditionality of the previous regime.

We reject the culture of 'earned autonomy', which is obsessed with the fear that you might try to run before you can walk.

As if either were possible with the chains of central government wrapped around your ankles.

The idea that local government can move forward with all of that weighing you down is absurd.

That's why the first phase of our reform programme is about breaking your chains.

Our chosen tool for this work is the Decentralisation and Localism Bill.

Which will be introduced into Parliament during this very first session.

**V: Over to you**

In any case, we regard the Bill as a beginning - not an end.

Setting you free to better do the job you already do is not the limit of our ambition.

For all of the reasons I described earlier and many more besides, community-based delivery of public services is the cornerstone of public sector reform.

This will require a fundamental rethink of standard Whitehall practice.

In particular, savings that are made locally should be retained locally.

I look forward to many happy hours working with my Treasury colleagues on that one.

And also with colleagues in other departments, who have inherited systems of highly centralised control over various public services.

But that is precisely the point of my role as Minister for Decentralisation.

Those who regard it as a contradiction in terms are making a basic error.

Decentralisation isn't about changing the way that local government works, but the way that central government works.

My job is to arrange an orderly transition of power from the centre, but not to tell you what to do with it.

For instance, I'm sure you've had enough of ministers who think that the way to strengthen local government is to reorganise it.

You have nothing to fear on this front from Eric Pickles, who has promised to shoot the first civil servant who so much as mentions the reorganisation of local government in his presence.

Regional government is another symptom of the old mentality.

There is, of course, a space for democratic decision-making that is larger than the local, but smaller than the national.

It's just nothing like the model imposed upon us by the previous administration.

What, after all, can you say about a system that groups Kent with Oxfordshire and the Isle of Wight, but divides the highly strategic Thames Estuary between three different regions?

Far from redrawing the map, our plan is to put it under your control, to place the powers of regional government in your hands and to give upper tier authorities the freedom to form new partnerships that conform to real needs and identities.

This issue is emblematic of our overall approach to decentralisation - which is to enable, not prescribe.

I don't say this to curry favour, because I don't expect it to be universally popular.

Even within local government there are those who have grown accustomed to their limits. There is, for some, a certain comfort in being told what to do.

But there are others who refuse to wear their chains as a security blanket. I know they exist because I've met them, I've heard their ideas and felt their frustration with the status quo.

These will be the innovators.

But, as in any successful enterprise, there will be imitators too.

These are equally valuable because their role will be to see what works and replicate it, spreading best practice across the country.

The idea of reform diffusing from place to place without reference to central government might be disturbing to the old mentality, but not to me or to my colleagues.

My pledge to you is to do everything in my power to help you make it happen.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

### Introduction

I am delighted to be here today at what is now my third of these events.

I am honoured to have been able to hold the position of Fire and Rescue Minister for what is now nearly two years. It has given me time to get to know you and understand the challenges you face. I hope to continue this dialogue, particularly with local councillors, to hear about the issues you face.

Over the last year we have again seen fire and rescue authorities exemplifying all that we rightly value in a public service. We clearly saw just how much we depend on fire and rescue as a high-performing emergency service in the public disorder that we saw on our streets this summer.

### Fire prevention

Put simply, the work you do saves lives. Fire and rescue authorities have been hugely successful in ensuring that our communities are safer places less exposed to the destruction and devastation caused by fire.

I know many of you work with the Fire Kills Campaign and I am delighted today to be able to announce that the Fire Kills national campaign has been given approval to continue in 2012/13.

We believe this and your wider prevention work, is a vital strand in our in our national fire safety armory - not only regularly reminding the public, through powerful media messages aligned to the forthcoming clock change, of the need to ensure they have a working smoke alarm, but also developing partnerships and working in collaboration with a range of organisations to target safety messages on those who are most vulnerable to the risk of fire.

Increasingly, the success of the Fire Kills campaign relies on a close relationship, based on true partnership with fire and rescue authorities, who must take much of the credit for the continuing stability around accidental fire deaths in home.

The valuable contribution fire and rescue authorities have made by supporting the campaign at the local level and implementing a raft of prevention and other community fire safety activities to delivering the fire prevention agenda has real impact.

As we look to the future this isn't the time to slow down - injuries rose by nine per cent over the past year, clearly emphasising the need a high profile focus to remain on prevention activity.

### Resetting the relationship

We need to continue the step change in the way we all engage. I am of course talking of resetting the relationship which is the clear vision I have been talking about it since my first speech back to you in Harrogate in 2010 - I would hope that it is something that you all recognise by now.

This vision is at the very heart of the Coalition Government's ambition - putting power back where it belongs - in communities and the locally elected councillors who represent them.

Over the last year we have been making this a reality. The provisions for fire and rescue authorities within the Localism Act came into force 18 February 2012. This is a huge milestone.

Empowering fire and rescue authorities with greater freedoms and flexibilities is a good example of central Government stepping back and letting you get on with your job.

We have also seen milestones such as the Open Public Service White Paper and new guidance on data transparency.

My department has already begun to change the way it works with you and together we have made some great steps forward in our vision to reset our relationship.

For example, the announcement a couple of weeks ago on of funding for future control rooms services saw a localist approach in action, securing improvements in national resilience, rather than the flawed top-down regionalisation of the fire service.

And last autumn we undertook a pre-market engagement exercise to help inform our view and options in securing the future of the Fire Service College. Having considered responses to the pre-market engagement with the help of our partners, the option which is emerging as the most likely to meet our objective is to sell the college as a going concern to a private sector company who would continue to operate the college as a training centre.

With the college freed from the constraints of government ownership, a private sector owner can bring innovation and investment to the College, benefiting taxpayers, local residents, the Fire and Rescue Service and, ultimately, strengthening national resilience.

I hope to be able to confirm the final decision shortly but if the College is sold we shall, insist on a number of conditions on the proposed sale, including commitments not only that the college will be preserved as a national training college for the fire and rescue authorities, but also that it will continue to offer wider national resilience and emergency services training and exercises, that the wider emergency services will be involved in the overall setting of training governance and that government permission will be required to sell the site on for other uses.

I know that fire and rescue authorities do not want to lose the college so if the decision is to sell it as a going concern I do hope that you will continue to support the college in its new ventures. In short use it or lose it!

### National Framework

Continuing with the resetting the relationship theme there are a few issues I would like to pick up.

As you will be aware the consultation on the draft National Framework has just closed and taking an early view of some of the responses we have noted the request for more guidance and detail.

The best thing I can do to help you improve services is to set the framework and context and get out of the way and let you get on with your job. I will not second guess you with central government guidance unless absolutely necessary. This is role for you as local leaders, supported by your national leadership bodies.

You know that I am keen that there are robust scrutiny arrangements in place. Many of you in fire and rescue authorities will already arrangements in place that meet the requirement in the draft Framework.

I do not consider it appropriate for proper scrutiny of decision making on public safety and how public funds are used to be treated as an extravagance that gets in the way of the day job - it is a core function of any public service to act in a transparent way.

Some of you have asked for more information on assurance statements. I see these as a proportionate requirement for an important public service with no specific inspectorate.

I am keen not to duplicate existing arrangements with these statements; and have asked my officials to work with the Local Government Association and the Chief Fire Officers Association to deliver a light touch approach to delivering such statements.

I am also aware that there has been some concern that the draft Framework doesn't highlight, as strongly as it has previously, achievements on fire prevention.

I'm absolutely sure no one doubts the significant contribution and impact the fire and rescue authorities have on protecting communities, especially those most vulnerable to fire.

The truth is local fire and rescue authorities are delivering their statutory duties to promote fire safety through innovative partnership approaches and engaging local communities. I am confident that these measures are saving lives and I support them. It is not central government's role to meddle in this good practice by adding additional requirements or window dressing platitudes through the National Framework.

What we will say is that you need to engage your communities - give them a real understanding of the risks being faced and the full range of what you are doing so they can better understand why you make the decisions you do.

We all know there are some increasingly tough decisions to be made on how best to allocate prevention, protection and operational resources locally to effectively mitigate both existing and potential risks. And that this needs to be done in a way that meets community aspirations in an open and consultative way.

By giving communities a voice, you give them a choice;

  * choice to make their views known on whether their priorities are the same as yours;
  * choice to come up with new ideas on service provision; and,
  * choice to challenge you on these issues.

National resilience remains a priority for government, and we will continue to retain strategic responsibility for ensuring that we are a nation resilient to significant risks. But we can only do this together, through true partnership, working across all local and national responders.

That is why I think we need a Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board, to bring key partners together to consider national resilience issues. Of course, government will continue to set the strategic direction, but our approach to national resilience must be based on and drawn from local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.

We can only prepare effectively if we have an approach to resilience, based on the local expertise and knowledge that is held by fire and rescue authorities. This is because every major emergency originates as a local emergency.

The involvement and leadership of all fire and rescue authorities is needed to ensure that the necessary capability is in place to keep communities safe. This means being able to plan effectively for all incidents and emergencies, irrespective of whether such emergencies are of a local, cross-border or national nature.

Communities rightly expect their local fire and rescue authorities to play their part in keeping the country safe, and I am pleased to see that a number of you embrace this approach to national resilience.

But not every one holds this view, and some query the Framework's expression of your Civil Contingency Act duties. I want to be clear that the draft Framework does _not_ set out any new roles and responsibilities in relation to national resilience for fire and rescue authorities. The draft Framework simply sets them out clearly and succinctly. The existing National Framework, Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, the Emergencies Order 2007 and the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 all set out requirements in relation to national resilience.

We have stated in the draft Framework that if it is seen that there is a need for building new national resilience capabilities, the case for who should provide the capability and how it should be funded will be considered carefully in line with the new burdens doctrine. All of this should ensure that our overall national resilience capability remains strong, and, with your leadership and commitment, we can continue to ensure that we are collectively working to ensure the safety of our citizens.

### Funding

I am of course mindful of the financial backdrop to all this change. We have taken tough decisions necessary to get public spending under control. No-one in this room is under any illusions about the wider economic challenges we face today.

But every bit of the public sector needs to play its part to cut the deficit inherited from the last administration. Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given some funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made without impacting on the quality and breadth of services offered to communities.

Funding reductions to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general and while spending decisions will be decided locally by individual fire and rescue authorities, there are many good examples that show that savings can be made without affecting the quality and breadth of front line services.

Further funding reductions are on their way for the whole of the public sector, including fire and rescue authorities. I've received representations from a number of you, and know that many of you are making great strives in efficiency. Thankfully fatalities are at an all time low and, thanks to innovation in industry, government action and the efforts of fire and rescue authorities, risks are falling.

If ever there was a time for strong local leadership, it's now. Fire and rescue authorities need to look closely at their own service configuration and recognise that we are all delivering services in a new environment.

In making such decisions fire and rescue authorities use integrated risk management planning to identify and assess local need and then put plans in place to mitigate risks to communities. For each authority, their integrated risk management plan will take account of their overall budget and resource to make strategic and operational decisions on the siting of fire stations, the staffing and equipping of such stations, and hours of operation of each station.

Fire and rescue authorities already have a strong record of delivering efficiencies and have developed a number of methods through which they could achieve the savings. A couple of examples…

The South East Fire Improvement Partnership is a collaborative procurement partnership providing work-wear uniforms for nine fire and rescue authorities involved in the partnership [Buckinghamshire; East Sussex; Hampshire, Isle of Wight; Kent; Oxfordshire; Royal Berkshire; Surrey and West Sussex]. I understand that initial savings are of over £500,000 with further efficiencies predicted over the whole life of the contract. This contract is now being rolled out to other fire and rescue authorities.

I know that many of you are being imaginative on staffing arrangements. Steve, if I may highlight Manchester's initiative to make savings , as just one example. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority are moving to a four shift annualised system where firefighters operate a much more flexible duty system by attending work outside of normal hours of duty to cover shortfalls, allowing for reductions in the size of the workforce overall. Further savings are being made by fire risk based availability of fire engines and the banking of firefighters hours to cover shortfalls during busier times. These changes in cover have been made against a backdrop of reductions in incidents driven by fire prevention work in communities.

In a different type of example I'd like to highlight Lee Howell's work in Devon & Somerset. They have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Falck EMS in June 2011 to develop ways of working together. Falck is a company providing emergency, training and assistance services, including fire fighting, fire training and fire consultancy services.

And I am sure there are many more examples from across fire and rescue authorities that you can all look at to adapt to local circumstances, to help you meet the challenges ahead.

### Capital Grant Funding

I am pleased today to announce the opening of the bidding process for capital grant funding for all fire and rescue authorities for 2013-15 which will support further improvements and efficiencies.

Last year we consulted on options for the distribution of capital grant funding, and on our proposal that fire capital grant funding be distributed based on a combination of:

  * an efficiency fund, administered via a bidding process; and
  * a pro rata distribution using the current distribution method.

You will be able to find the guidance, timelines and related documents on our website by later today and we hope to have concluded the bidding process and made announcements on outcomes by the autumn this year.

### Pensions

Lastly I wanted to just briefly touch upon the issue of pensions which I understandably know is of real importance to your workforce. As you will be aware the Heads of agreement was reached on the 9th of February for a new pension scheme.

The new scheme remains a very good scheme, affording protection for those closest to retirement. Detailed discussions are ongoing with unions and the Local Government Association on behalf of the employers and local employers have a key role in engaging with their workforces over what the reform means for them.

I remain optimistic that reform can be delivered through agreement.

### Conclusion

I can appreciate that the last year has been a period of much change and the pace has been rapid. Your drive and your expertise are essential to meeting these changes.

In this important year, when we can look forward with pride and anticipation to this summer's Olympic and Paralympic Games and the key roles during the Torch Relay and both Games the Fire and Rescue Service will be playing, and when our communities will be at the proudest, it seems right that we are continuing to restore focus back where it belongs, in our communities and with those elected members who serve them. It is the right thing to do.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

Thanks Gary.

I've been Housing Minister for over a year now. That's quite an achievement - I shadowed four different Ministers when in opposition.

I am very pleased to be in the position and I look forward to continuing in it.  I think you need time covering housing to grasp the important and complex issues that it embraces.

I am proud to be starting my second year.

However, as I am Minister for Housing and Local Government I wanted to take some time at the beginning of my speech to stress the importance of the Councillor's role.

### Councillors role

I can clearly remember a lead councillor for planning introducing somebody in the room to the Head of Planning at his Council as ""the boss"".

Obviously this was a joke (I think), but as with so many jokes, it revealed a hidden truth.

As elected members it is too easy to surrender power to the bureaucrat.

Some of you in the room may have been newly elected in May. You may already be experiencing frustrations. Being told you can't do this. You mustn't do that. And certainly shouldn't say the other thing.

But remember why you chose to stand for election in the first place. You want to represent people. If we were in America I'd say you've stepped up to the plate. But I'd prefer to say you've put on your pads and made your way to the crease.

But what happens then - for too long central Government has bamboozled you with googlies. Directive after directive has flowed out of Whitehall. They then tied your legs together with red tape while telling you to get on with the job. And told you how much money you could spend on what bat. It all seemed to be designed to make it impossible for you to decide for yourselves what to do for your communities.

But it's YOU as someone who is accountable to the people who elected YOU - not me, not a Whitehall civil servant and not your local officers - who are in charge.

So we're changing the rules.

### Localism

The Localism Bill, when it is passed, will fundamentally shift the balance of power in this country. It is part of on an ambitious programme of reform to put you back in the driving seat. We are giving the powers the State has taken, back to the people.

We will reform the planning system so local people can decide what happens in their neighbourhoods. We will tear up the restrictive regulations that stop you from doing what is in the best interest of the people you represent.

And we will give you the power to run your own council housing finance.

Whitehall will no longer decide what happens in the Town Hall.

That's your job.

### Housing policy

The Government has now been in power for just over a year and it's been a busy time.

I was anxious to change things in housing particularly quickly. And we have.

We ripped up the Regional Targets because they didn't work and foreshadowed the biggest slump in house building since the 1920s.

Instead of targets people need to see the benefit of building the new homes that the country needs.

The New Homes Bonus is already in place.

You will have already received the first cash bonus based on how many homes were built last year.  
   
And you will now be spending it.

I would urge you to work with communities so they can get their hands on more cash next year. You need to be leading the debate with communities about the benefits of growth.

Obviously it's been a difficult year for budgeting. We had to address a massive public deficit by cutting public expenditure.

Things could have only got worse if the coalition Government hadn't agreed a programme to cut the deficit.

And things won't get much easier until the economy starts growing faster and that's why getting the house building industry building homes again is essential.

I'd urge you to think about how you can work with  
developers to get Britain building again.

Yesterday I announced that we are making it easier for people to reclaim the land the public owns.

And to use it for the public benefit.

The public sector owns previously developed land more than twice the size of Leicester. 

If we push hard we can unlock land to deliver up to 100,000 homes and support thousands of jobs.

I am driving through the process to get that land put forward.

The Community Right To Reclaim Land sits alongside the Community Right To Build.

We are giving people more power to shape where they live and we are giving you new freedoms to help them.

We will get rid of one thousand pages of planning law and six thousand pages of planning guidance and replace it all with one simple and short statement - with a rather long name!

The National Planning Policy Framework,

This Framework will replace all the existing Planning Policy Statements and Planning Policy Guidance Notes.

All those PPSs and PPGs that kept lawyers so busy and gave many of you a constant headache.

We will also be giving more flexibility to local housing authorities to decide who goes on the housing waiting list and how that list is managed.

More flexibility on the types of tenancies that those of you with housing stock can grant.

And tenancy strategies will enable you as local housing authorities to set broad objectives for your local area.

I think it's right that you, as local leaders, provide transparency so that everyone knows the broad objectives of tenancy policies of all providers of social housing in your area.

But remember it will be you, not central Government, who will be able to decide what sort of tenancy is right for your new tenants.

You will be able to manage your own waiting list and housing stock in the best interests of the local community.

And if you have transferred ownership of the council's stock you will need to work in partnership with developers and local housing associations to provide the homes local people need.

The Affordable Rent model gives providers freedom to set rents at up to 80 per cent of local market rents and to grant flexible tenancies.

This new tenancy, together with new flexibilities on the use of existing assets, gives you freedom to generate additional financial capacity to support new supply.

And the repeal of the Housing Revenue Account system and the introduction of self-financing will mean that councils can run their housing stock from their rental income. 

This is a complex subject - it has taken many years to get to this point.

And yes, some councils will have to make a single payment to central Government whilst others will receive a payment.

But the reform will increase the money all councils have to spend on services - by an average of 14 per cent.

Tenants will benefit from this increased funding and local control so spending is determined by local priorities.

It will also create a more efficient system - by ending the process of taking the money into Whitehall before paying it back out.

Councils will keep all rental income from their tenants and will have to set out how the local rental income is being used to maintain the stock.

This will enable tenants to scrutinise the services offered by their landlords and hold them to account.

Of course, some have been arguing for years that you should also have control over receipts from Council House sales.

I understand your frustrations here, but difficult decisions had to be made in the Spending Review and this was one of them.

But we have made sure that the self-financing settlement continues to be viable by reducing the debt councils will have to take on.

We've allocated £862 million to cover the loss of rental income from projected sales. And councils will continue to be able to keep 25 per cent of receipts from Right to Buy sales.

### Deregulation

But I'm sure there may be other things we can do to give you more control.

Last Autumn I invited Local Authority Heads of Housing to an event in Westminster. We ceremoniously dumped reams of regulations into a recycling cart.

It was a good start.

I've also asked housebuilders to let me know what regulatory burdens we could lift from their backs so they could build more homes. I've got their list - we're working our way through it and have made a good start in getting rid of burdens.

Today I want to ask you what more I can do to help.

I will continue to work with Gary and his colleagues to make sure that the Localism Bill really does devolve power to you.

On my first day in the job I got rid of Home Information Packs.  I would like to hear about other pieces of red tape that are tying you down.

I want to free you to do your job.

### Conclusion

For I am full of admiration for you - as Councillors you have volunteered to take on a leading role in your community.

You do it largely unpaid.

Indeed often all you receive in recompense is criticism.

Sometimes it must seem a thankless up hill struggle.

But you can be real community heroes - the vanguard of the Big Society - working hard to do good in your communities. I am hugely impressed by the work that you do and I want to give you more powers to do even more good.

But here's some advice - don't surrender that power to your officials.

After all it's you who will be held accountable at the ballot box - not them.

The Government has got so far so quickly because we knew what we wanted to do and didn't take ""No"" for an answer.

Or even the more subtle ""Yes, Minister!"" when they really mean no. Remember it's your role to lead your officials - not the other way round.

For, when the time comes, it's YOU who will have to answer to the electorate.

So be brave, be heroic, and stand up for your community. Get in the driving seat and provide the homes your communities need.

If you listen to the people and translate their views into reality they'll thank you for it at the ballot box.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2054462,Local government finance: December 2011,"* * *

Later today, I am introducing legislation which will take forward proposals designed to encourage local economic growth, reduce the financial deficit, we have inherited from the last Administration, promote welfare reform and drive decentralisation of control over local government finance.

The Local Government Finance Bill will take forward key proposals which were considered as part of the Local Government Resource Review and announced in the Spending Review 2010. The local government finance system that we inherited from the last Administration is one of the most complex and centralised in the world. These reforms will address this, and increase transparency over the local finance system.  

The Local Government Finance Bill will take forward our commitment to introduce a local business rates retention scheme which will enable local authorities to retain a proportion of the business rates generated in their area.

Today, I have published the Government Response to the consultation on Business Rates Retention which sought views over the summer on how a rate retention scheme would operate. The response puts forward a strong scheme that I believe will provide a strong financial incentive for local authorities to grow their local economies with the necessary safeguards to ensure authorities with high need and low tax bases are still able to meet the needs of their areas. These reforms will also provide local authorities with the framework to implement Tax Increment Financing. Businesses will see no difference in the way they pay business rates or they way that they are set. Local charities, voluntary groups and small businesses will continue to be eligible for the same reliefs.

These reforms will boost local firms and local jobs as councils are given more autonomy over their own financial circumstances, and rewarded for building stronger relationships with business to strengthen the local economy. They have the potential to increase the aggregate income from business rates, compared to the status quo, due to greater enterprise and economic growth.

The Bill will also enable local authorities in England to set up local schemes of support for council tax, replacing council tax benefit. This will give local authorities the flexibility to design schemes which reflect local priorities, giving them a greater financial stake in the economic future of their area and enabling them to deliver a saving of 10 per cent on the current council tax benefit expenditure bill. This saving is an important contribution to Government's vital deficit reduction programme.

The new system will be a fairer one, where tax payers can be more confident that the spiralling benefits bill is controlled and where work pays . Councils will be much better placed to attract new business and industry, better placed to help their residents get off welfare and reap the benefits of work instead. They will directly benefit from improving the prosperity of the local area that will in turn drive down the costs of offering support with council tax.

I have today published the Government's response to the recent consultation on localising support for council tax, setting out the Government's policy and how we plan to support local authorities in implementing schemes in their areas.

Local authorities will have much greater freedom to administer rebates in a way that best meets local needs and best supports local people whilst safeguards will be put in place to protect pensioners from any reduction in the support that is on offer as a result of the introduction of this reform.

Subject to consultation, the Bill will propose changes to council tax rules to provide further flexibility on the council tax local authorities can charge on empty properties, and other small changes aimed at modernising the system. By treating everyone equally and fairly and removing the special tax breaks for empty homes and second homes, councils have the potential to cut £20 a year off families' council tax bills.

I intend to continue to work closely with local authorities, representative groups and other key parties in the design of the framework to be set out in secondary legislation, and welcome the excellent contribution I know they will make to the ongoing development and implementation of these proposals.

These proposals on council tax stand alongside the Government's two year council tax freeze, the cancellation of a council tax revaluation, the abolition of new bin taxes on family homes and new rights for local residents to veto excessive council tax rises.

These reforms also complement a wide package of financial measures that the Government is pursuing to support local authorities and local economies. These measures include over £430 million of funding under New Homes Bonus, up to £1 billion in Community Infrastructure Levy, access to the £2.4 billion Regional Growth Fund and £500 million Growing Places Fund through Local Enterprise Partnerships.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,19-Dec-2011,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

I would like to make a statement on the work of the Local Government Resource Review.

The current dependency of councils on central grant allocations makes planning difficult, weakens accountability, and stifles local innovation. In the future, I am keen to move to a radically different system of funding and support for councils that is built on strong incentives, is driven by local decision-making and breaks this dependency.

I have therefore set up a review of local government resources that will consider how we can recast the distribution of business rates and Formula Grant to deliver a more effective income stream for councils. The focus will be to free up as many local authorities as possible from dependency on central government funding, as well as develop better incentives for local authorities to promote economic growth in their areas and to benefit financially from that growth. The first phase of the Review will deliver proposals for reform by July 2011.

The Review will consider the way in which local authorities are funded, with a view to giving local authorities greater financial autonomy and strengthening the incentives to support growth in the private sector and regeneration of local economies.

It will look at ways to reduce the reliance of local government on central government funding, increase local accountability and ensure that the benefits of economic growth are reflected in the resources authorities have.

The review will include consideration of changes to the business rates system, and focus in particular on:

  1. the optimum model for incentivising local authorities to promote growth by retaining business rates, whilst ensuring that all authorities have adequate resources to meet the needs of their communities and to deliver the commitments set out in the Spending Review;
  2. the extent to which these proposals can set local authorities free from dependency on central funding;
  3. considering how to fund authorities where locally raised funding would be insufficient to meet budget requirements and control council tax levels, as well as councils who do not collect business rates, such as upper tier authorities, recognising that some parts of the country are currently more dependent on government funding;
  4. reviewing the scope for greater transparency and localisation of the equalisation process;
  5. the position of councils whose business rate yield would be significantly higher than their current spending;
  6. how to ensure appropriate protections are in place for business, within a framework of devolving power to the lowest level possible;
  7. how to deliver Tax Increment Financing proposals against a context of greater retention of business rate revenues;
  8. how various aspects of the business rate system, including business rate revaluation and reliefs, should be treated;
  9. examining the scope for further financial freedoms for local authorities, while standing up for and protecting the interests of local taxpayers; and
  10. the wider implications of rates retention for related policies, including the work of the Commission on the Funding of Care and Support and the Government's other incentive schemes (the New Homes Bonus and the commitment to allow communities to keep the business rates for renewable energy projects).

The Review will take account of the responses made to the questions in _Local growth: Realising every place's potential_. It will also conduct extensive engagement with interested parties, including businesses of all sizes, to ensure that all views and perspectives are taken into account. In developing the proposals, the Government is clear that businesses should not be subject to locally imposed increases in the burden of taxation that they do not support.

Following the announcement at the Spending Review and through introduction of the Welfare Reform Bill that Government will localise Council Tax Benefit, the Review will also consider the design of the new scheme (to be launched in 2013-14) and what flexibilities local authorities should have to help keep overall council tax levels down.

The first phase of Review will conclude by July 2011, followed by the necessary steps to implement the concluded reforms.

The second phase of the Local Government Resource Review will commence in April 2011 and will focus on community budgets. It will be taken forward in parallel with the continued roll out of these Budgets. Detailed terms of reference will be published shortly.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,17-Mar-2011,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/finance201113,Local government finance 2011 to 2013,"* * *

With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement on finance for English local authorities for 2011 to 2013.

The spending review set out how the Government would tackle the catastrophic levels of public debt by delivering necessary reductions in public spending to accelerate deficit reduction and put the public finances back on a sustainable footing. This has involved difficult, but essential and responsible, decisions. Every part of the public sector needs to do its bit to help to reduce the highest deficit in the UK's peacetime history and the rapidly rising national debt that this Government have inherited.

Last year, the Government borrowed one pound in every four they spent. That threatened our economic credibility. In contrast, our plans to eliminate the current structural deficit over five years have won the backing of the International Monetary Fund, kept our credit rating steady and held interest rates down. The Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast confirms we are taking the right steps. Its message is that Britain's recovery is on track.

I have sought to achieve a fair and sustainable settlement for local government by listening to what the local government community has asked for. It will be a progressive settlement that is fair between different parts of the country. First, we have focused on the most vulnerable communities with significant social challenges. These are often the areas that are most reliant on Government grant, so equal grant reductions would leave the poorest places worst off. We have insulated them by giving more weight to the levels of need within different areas and less weight to per capita distributions. We have also grouped councils into four bands, reflecting their dependence on central Government. More dependent places will therefore see proportionally lower falls than more self-sufficient places.

Secondly, we have listened to concerns about the front-loading of the reductions. The Local Government Association asked me to focus on local government total spending, including not just grants but income from council tax and NHS funding to support social care and benefit health. It said that reductions in spending should be limited to 8 per cent. As far as possible, I have given the LGA what it asked for. I have made sure that no authority will face more than an 8.9 per cent reduction in spending power in either 2011-12 or 2012-13. In fact, the average reduction in spending power for 2011-12 is 4.4 per cent. To fund this, I have transferred an extra £30 million of my Department's budget to local government for 2011-12. I have also provided a grant of £85 million for 2011-12 and £14 million for 2012-13 to fund councils who would otherwise have seen sharper falls.

The spending review also announced that the Government will protect the public from excessive council tax rises. We have set aside £650 million so every council can freeze council tax next year without hitting local services. We will provide councils that freeze council tax with the equivalent of a 2.5 per cent increase in funding instead. That will provide real help to hard-working families and people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners. The Government also want to ensure that council tax payers are protected against authorities that reject the offer and impose excessive council tax rises. We will introduce powers for residents to veto excessive council tax increases through a local referendum. In the meantime, the Government will take capping action against councils that propose excessive rises.

When the House debates the final local government finance report next year, I will set out the capping principles. I will also publish shortly details of the figures that will be used to compare authorities' budgets between years, should capping be necessary. The previous Government had planned to cap the police authorities of Greater Manchester and Nottinghamshire after they set excessive increases in 2010-11. Subject to challenge, we will ensure that, should they decide not to freeze the council tax, neither can impose an increase of over 2.5 per cent in 2011-12.

This settlement also supports the Government's commitment to adult social care, providing councils with sufficient resources to protect people's access to care and to deliver improved quality of outcome. That includes £150 million of NHS funding in 2011-12 to support social care services, promoting integrated working between primary care trusts and local authorities and benefiting the health system. The settlement directs more formula grant to authorities that deliver social care.

Despite all the actions we have taken, I recognise that local government still faces significant challenges. The vast majority of councils have been making sensible plans to address them. I support that and I am restoring real power to councils, ensuring that Whitehall interference, red tape and the burdens of inspection and regulations are gone. The Localism Bill, published today, will deliver a new democratic settlement to local councils, overturning decades of central Government control.

For too long, councils have been barred from using their initiative and creativity to improve services. The limited ""power of well-being"" acted as an obstacle to cost savings, such as mutual insurance companies. Today's Bill will fundamentally change councils' freedom to act in the interest of their local communities through a new general power of competence. That will give councils the legal reassurance and confidence they need to innovate, drive down costs and deliver more effective services. I am also giving councils greater control over their budgets.

With very few exceptions, we have ended grant ring-fencing so that councils can decide for themselves how their money is spent. We will also allow them to borrow against future business rates receipts. Councils now have the freedom and responsibility to concentrate on what residents want: protecting front-line services. To support them, I have set aside £200 million to help councils to modernise and reduce back-office costs.

Councils can protect front-line services by sharing services and back-office functions, improving procurement to get more for less, bringing increasing senior pay under control and using transparency to cut waste. Proactive councils are already taking the opportunity radically to rethink and transform their services. There are also substantial incentives available for councils to invest in long-term projects, which include the new homes bonus and £1.4 billion of regional growth funds over three years-a fund that goes well beyond the working neighbourhoods fund. There will now be a statutory consultation on the settlement for 2011-12 and I look forward to hearing representations from councils.

Finally, this is a transitional settlement, using an inherited system. That is why I have set out details only for the next two years to strike a balance between the need to help councils plan and the need to reform the system. This system, based on redistributing business rates, makes councils heavily reliant on handouts from central Government-some depend on us for up to 75 per cent of their spending power. It is part of the trend that has led to some areas of the country becoming completely dependent on the public sector. It makes planning difficult, weakens local accountability and stifles local innovation. There is no incentive for councils to invest in their local economy as they will see most of the proceeds disappear.

That is why I have set up a review of business rates with the intention that, in future, local government will be able to keep more of what it collects. Ultimately, the councils that invest and support the local economy will be able better to use the finances themselves. The local government resource review will begin in the new year. I commend the statement to the House.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,oral-statement,13-Dec-2010,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/localgovernmentsavings,Local government savings,"* * *

The Government has made clear that deficit reduction is its most urgent priority. On Monday, 24 May, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Chief Secretary to the Treasury therefore announced that the Government would save over £6 billion from spending during this financial year. Included in that savings package were £1.166 billion reductions in grants to local government. I have today placed in the Library of the House information on the revenue and capital grants which will be reduced.

The Government is clear that deficit reduction, and continuing to ensure economic recovery, is the most pressing issue facing Britain. This will restore confidence in the economy and support the recovery. Advice from the Treasury and Bank of England is that it is better to start to make the reductions in the current financial year. Not to do so will simply delay the need for savings in future years, thereby compounding the impact on public services, including those delivered by local authorities, in the future. It is fair that local authorities make a contribution to the savings to enable Government to take immediate action to tackle the UK's unprecedented deficit in this financial year.

It is time for a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to individuals and their communities. We want to end the era of top-down government by providing a radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local authorities.

So we will reduce the performance management burden on local government through abolishing the Comprehensive Area Assessment and reducing ring-fencing of central government grants, freeing up resources to concentrate on local priorities and the delivery of essential frontline services. We are committed to a full review of local government finance, to giving councils a general power of competence, and to working with local authorities to freeze council tax in England for at least one year as outlined in the Coalition Agreement and seek to freeze it for a further year, in partnership with local authorities. All of this will help to create the shift of power from the centre to local people that we are determined to deliver.

I am absolutely clear about the importance of the services which local government provides. So we have been determined to ensure local authorities can shield their key frontline services.

The Government has looked at whether it is possible to focus the reductions on grants which have not yet been committed through grant determinations or other statutory restrictions. This has been possible to some extent. Some of the reductions occur in grants where there are underspends, where the money has yet to be allocated or where a grant determination has not yet been made. However, because of the scale of the contribution from local government, it has not been possible to achieve the necessary levels of reduction without reducing some allocations included in grant determinations. Local Government along with the rest of society is being asked to play its part in helping to reduce the deficit. Where we have reduced revenue grants, no local authority will face a reduction of more than 2 per cent. This compares to the cut in running costs for my Department and its quangos of 10 per cent in 2010/11.

We have ensured that councils have the flexibility to take decisions locally on how to deliver the savings needed. I am pleased that we have been able to keep Formula Grant at the level approved by Parliament of £29 billion. We have also announced further removal from ringfencing of central government revenue and capital grants. This gives councils extra flexibility to make decisions about where savings are found, although this is subject to the usual rules which ensure that capital funding is used on capital expenditure. A list of grants which have been removed from ringfencing is included in the information made available in the House.

There are good reasons for the changes we have made. For example, we believe that the Housing and Planning Delivery Grant has proved to be an ineffective and excessively complex incentive. The coalition agreement set out that we will provide incentives for local authorities to deliver sustainable development, including for new homes and businesses.

The Government believes that there is significant scope for local authorities to find efficiencies in the way in which they deliver services. We believe there are further opportunities for an increased role for joint working between local authorities and between different types of public authorities across local areas. Our focus on providing councils with the flexibility to manage budgets effectively will ensure that councils can deliver those services which local people wish to see.

I recognise that making savings in-year will be challenging for local authorities, as it will be for other parts of the public sector. The information which my Department is today sending to every local authority provides the detail councils need to make the necessary decisions as quickly as possible on how they will deliver the necessary changes. I have also made available in the Library of the House, a copy of the information which we have sent to each local authority which sets out the revised allocations.

I know that councils want this information as a matter of urgency and we have worked hard to deliver this. The Government therefore wishes to provide as much clarity and flexibility to local authorities and other public bodies as quickly as possible so that they can best handle the changes proposed without an impact on key frontline services.

I am satisfied that we have adopted a fair approach to making the necessary reductions in the different grants and funding streams. We are therefore simply asking councils to check quickly to make sure that there are no errors in the calculation of the reductions.

The detailed spending decisions we are outlining today show a clear determination to help tackle the immense public deficit the new Government has inherited.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

There is no greater responsibility, no higher priority for this Government than to get the nation back on track towards renewed, long-term, sustainable growth.

Growth puts people in jobs, keeps families in homes, makes our towns and cities great places to live.

Getting public spending under control has been vital and non-negotiable.

We've strained every sinew to do it in a way that protects the most vulnerable.

Today is Blue Monday - officially the most depressing day of the year, as people look ahead to months of chilly weather and paying back their Christmas bills.

This year, it will be tough for many people - facing pay freezes at work, be it in the public or private sector, as well as a rising cost of living.

This is why it's essential in February and March, as town hall budgets are set, that councils sign up to the council tax freeze.

It's practical help every councillor can offer to their ward constituents. A vote against the council tax freeze is a vote for punishing tax-rises. Local taxpayers will remember that decision next time they cast their vote at the ballot box.

Councillors have a moral duty to sign up to keep down the cost of living - anything less is a kick in the teeth to hard-working, decent taxpayers.

But cutting the deficit is only the first step.

We want to give investors confidence to invest.

Make it easy for entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to market.

Make Britain one of the best places in Europe, if not the world, to start and grow and business.

Now in the past, supporting growth might have been seen as a job for the Treasury and Business Department.

But we simply don't have that luxury today.

This is a job for every part of Government.

Including my Department.

I am determined that the Department for Communities and Local Government should be at the forefront of creating the right conditions for local economies to thrive.

Not least because localism and growth are two sides of the same coin.

### Localism and Growth

You can't engineer, can't manufacture growth through nationally-dictated plans and blueprints.

However well-meaning, however expertly devised, Regional Development Agencies simply didn't deliver.

Even in the five years to 2008, before the crunch really bit, the number of private sector jobs fell in Birmingham, in Nottingham, in Sheffield, Bradford, Croydon and Leicester.

Instead of trying to impose growth from Whitehall, we want to encourage and celebrate local leadership, ingenuity, and enterprise.

Instead of the public sector going solo, we want to get councils and entrepreneurs working together.

So we're creating the conditions for local leadership.

Local Enterprise Partnerships put civic leaders and local entrepreneurs in the driving seat as never before.

Partnerships now host two dozen Enterprise Zones - with tax breaks and simple planning rules to attract new firms.

Partnerships have advised firms bidding for the two point four billion pounds available under Regional Growth Fund - helping safeguard jobs everywhere from steelyards in Redcar, to biotechnology start-ups in Plymouth.

And now we're reforming business rates, so that councils see a direct benefit to their own finances from boosting the local economy…

…and this will give every council every possible reason to work with businesses and entrepreneurs.

But perhaps the policy that best encapsulates the new approach is the Growing Places Fund.

Half a billion quid is up for grabs for local leaders to support enterprise, encourage businesses, create the conditions for local growth.

What have we asked Local Enterprise Partnerships to do to get their hands on it?

Not complete a form the size of a telephone directory…

Not report every five minutes on every step along the way…

But set out they want to do with the cash, and what they aim to deliver, in terms as simple as we could possibly make them.

It's a process that is based on our trust in local leaders to deliver.

This means making tough decisions and putting the cash where it can make the biggest difference - not where it's most expedient, or will appease the most people.

Get this right, vindicate our trust, and this could be the shape of things to come.

Get it wrong, and well - we're back to the strings and guidelines, the gentle breath of the overseer tickling the hairs on the back of your neck.

### Over to You

So the spotlight falls on you.

To a great extent, what happens in your area next is in your hands.

We've binned the guidance, the strictures, the blueprints.

As local leaders - whether in business or the Town Hall - for the first time in decades - you've got a clear run.

Your communities are looking to you to lead. To shape the future of your local economies.

Now after a little over a year of Local Enterprise Partnerships, there has been good progress.

Coventry and Warwickshire have worked with local banks to unlock finance for start-ups.

Tees Valley Unlimited are working with the UK's Trade and Investment service to draw in foreign investment.

Places with Enterprise Zones, from Harlow to Hull, are getting on with the necessary to make them a success.

Manchester, for example, have unveiled their detailed plans for Airport City, with the potential to create twenty thousand new jobs, and dozens of firms are already keen to move in.

So on the one hand there's a huge amount going on.

But on the other there's absolutely no room for complacency - especially when we can all feel the chill winds blowing from the Continent.

So use today to galvanise your approach.

Some people have said, ""we'd love to do our bit but we'd really like some more instruction.""

It's a play: Waiting for Guidance.

But the best aren't hanging around.

Look at the West of England.

They've not only secured an Enterprise Zone...

They're also setting up ""Enterprise Areas"" too, with similar, straightforward planning rules, the better to attract new firms.

They didn't wait to be told. They thought, ""what can we do?"" and they did it.

Some have said, ""there's money coming in but it's going to our neighbours, or the upper tier, or the lower tier.""

Well then - cut a deal.

If you're going to make the most of localism, you can't waste time bickering.

The best will join forces.

Some will consider pooling their business rate incomes under the new system…

…sharing the risks and rewards, and helping everyone plan ahead.

If you're not quite there yet - if you know in your heart of hearts that's more you could be doing…

Really use today.

Look at your contemporaries in the room.

Learn from each other.

Challenge each other.

If there are people here you don't know yet - get stuck in.

Who knows if that stranger isn't the person who can make the links between your universities and business, between your exporters and new markets, between your entrepreneurs and lenders. 

Above all, there is no point clinging to the old levers and approaches.

The world has changed.

Nobody's going to try and force a solution on you.

Nobody's going to stop you pursuing your own.

Be creative, be ambitious. Do what it takes to create the conditions for your economy to grow.

### What it Means

I want to end by thinking about what's at stake here.

Not too far from my constituency is the Ford plant at Dagenham.

As British engineering faltered towards the end of the last century, it became a symbol of decline.

Of glories past.

The kind of place that motorists snatch in glimpses as they hurtle past on the A13.

Now of course there are still challenges for British automotive industry.

But believe me, it's on the way back.

In the year to last October…despite the tough conditions…despite the uncertainty in the markets…this country increased exports of vehicles by nearly twenty per cent.

Who'd have dreamt that ten years ago.

Dagenham, meanwhile, now produces a million engines each year, and employs four thousand people.

Creating the conditions for growth is about turning places like Dagenham from symbols of decline, to symbols of hope.

It's about making space for new industries that give places a sense of purpose.

And about giving the people who look to you a reason to feel proud.

It goes back to why you're here today.

I doubt very much that anyone gets into public affairs purely for the love of a beautiful spreadsheet, a snappy minute or a well-chaired committee.

We do it because we want to make change happen.

Today, you've got a golden opportunity to be the people who create growth, support jobs, underpin the prosperity and quality of life of the communities you work in.

It's up to you to make the most of it.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London",,,,16-Jan-2012,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

It's a privilege to be here today and to follow in the illustrious footsteps of those who have given this lecture in the past.

The spirit of the CPRE is people's sense of connection to the place where they live. By and large people live where they do by choice, and they love where they live. They understand local life. They want to make their homes and neighbourhoods better places, not for the short term, but in a way that benefits people for years to come.

This same insight is at the heart of many of the reforms that this Government is making. What we would call localism shapes our approach to a whole range of different areas of policy. In a sense, your timing today is impeccable. I have just come from the House of Commons, and will be going back there very shortly to continue discussion with my parliamentary colleagues about the Localism Bill.

This is a landmark piece of legislation. It marks a break with a tradition that has endured for many years, and through different political administrations, where central government has passed new laws principally in order to draw more powers to itself. It did this with the best of intentions - thinking that taking power centrally - distilling a vision of 'best practice' and promulgating it more widely - is the most effective way to solve social problems, promote local growth and make public services perform better.

But there's a growing consensus in many different places that we've reached the point of diminishing returns of this approach. There's a growing acceptance of the importance of another tradition - of giving people a voice, letting them express their passion for an area, and granting free rein to their enthusiasm to do things for their community. And there's a new acknowledgement that too great a measure of central control can actually be corrosive, dispiriting the people who most want to play their part in improving local life.

With the Localism Bill, we're turning things around. Instead of hoarding power, we're giving it away. The Bill will cut red tape, introduce new rights for communities, and give local councils a degree of discretion unparalleled in the modern age. It will put real influence in the hands of local people. It will help them do things their way; make public services do what they want; shape the future of their neighbourhood as they want to see it. In a parliamentary session with many measures designed to put power back where it belongs, the Localism Bill is the single most radical measure, the keystone in the arch.

Among its major reforms, the Bill introduces profound changes to Britain's planning system - the area which has always been CPRE's priority.

An excess of central command and prescription has contributed to three major flaws with the system as it stands.

First, we built fewer new homes last year than in any year since the 1920s, bar the Second World War. At the same time, the rate of household formation is increasing. More people are choosing to live in smaller households. There is a great aspiration among young people to establish themselves independently, yet the age of first time buyers continues to rise. And waiting lists for social housing have grown significantly over recent years.

The second flaw is the impact on business. Businesses, domestic and overseas, often cite the current planning system as a barrier to growth and an impediment to inward investment in this country. We have a system that is slow to deliver development, and that can only be navigated with the help of costly specialist and legal advice. This is acting as a brake on the country's economic success.

The third flaw is the level of antagonism and heat in the system, which seems to have risen inexorably over recent years. It follows from a situation where people feel that they have little choice and little opportunity to influence planning decisions in a positive manner. When it has seemed to them to be the only avenue to express themselves, perhaps it is understandable that some people have felt inclined simply to say ""no."" This has left us in a disastrous situation. In some places, the assumption has taken root that any new building will be damaging, and that all development is bad. In some places there seems to be a culture of resistance to the very idea of development.

This goes against all our traditions. Our built environment has been a source of incalculable pleasure and benefit for generations. This city's great buildings, bridges and towers attract millions of visitors each year from the world over. In rural areas, the interplay of natural beauty and human stewardship has made this country's landscapes the envy of the world. I want us to be able to be proud of our built environment.

Let me be explicit: I am pro-growth and pro-development. Not any old growth - not slapdash, not gimcrack, not jerry-building. Not growth without care for the areas of peace and beauty that people love and value most. That's why we made the commitment in the Coalition Agreement to protect the Green Belt. And that's why we intend to introduce a new designation whereby local people can protect the green areas that are most important to local life. I intend to set out to parliament our proposals for how that new designation might work very soon.

But I am in favour of, and want to see more of, properly planned, properly managed, locally-supported growth - well sited, well designed; meeting the right environmental standards; and in tune with what local people want. Our proposals are designed not to hamper development, but to unlock and encourage the right kind of development.

Faced with the shortcomings in the current system, there is a choice. You can tinker with the details - smooth an edge here, iron out an inefficiency there. Or you can reflect on the underlying causes of the difficulties, and take fundamental action to address them.

The Bill addresses two principal causes of the shortcomings with the current planning system. The first is to do with power. In recent years, the planning system has, in my view, come to rely far too strongly on elements of central prescription. Take Regional Spatial Strategies, with their housing targets. Perhaps it's a basic human characteristic, or perhaps it's a national trait, but people do not like being told what to do. They kick back. The result of housing targets has been not to get more homes built, but to create a stand-off between the people promoting the numbers from a regional office and the people on the ground who have to live with the consequences.

Conversely, cooperation and close involvement with local communities helps make sure that the right kind of development goes ahead: development that is sensitive to local people's needs and concerns, and their desire to protect what makes their home special.  The principle of working closely with local people is embraced by environmental groups and developers alike. At Committee, Adrian Penfold of British Land said this:

> ""The best situations are where we work with local authorities and communities to get around the feelings of imposition, and developments happen.""

A second cause of the problems in the current system is the fact that too often, local communities do not see the benefits of growth. New development is not accompanied by the vitally needed investment in infrastructure - in schools, transport, hospitals, parks and other amenities - to reflect new demands. It should come as no surprise that communities are reluctant to see new building in their area when they have no sense of ownership and feel they bear the brunt of the costs without proper recognition or support.

The Bill addresses both of these root causes. It gets rid of Regional Spatial Strategies and their housing targets, and I think there's increasingly widespread support for this. It introduces a requirement on developers planning large projects to consult local people before they make a planning application, as the best already do, so that communities can have a say at an early stage while plans are still fluid; meaningful input, rather than ""take it or leave it."" And the Bill introduces - in the form of neighbourhood planning - a radical new means for people to take control, at a more local level than ever before, of the look and feel of the places where they live. All of these measures are intended to give people genuine choices and the opportunity to make decisions for themselves.

The Bill also introduces reform to ensure that local people feel the benefits of local development. In consultation on the New Homes Bonus, we're proposing that local authorities who take responsibility for encouraging development should be appropriately recognised, with six years of matched council tax for each new home. We estimate that this might be worth, on average, around £10,000 per new home. In the Bill itself, we're also proposing reform of the community infrastructure levy, so that a meaningful proportion of the cash raised from a charge on new development is passed directly to the very local community - that, is the people who live next door or down the road for the new estate or offices.

These are real reasons to say ""yes"" to development. But they must be seen in the context of a planned system.

I have the greatest respect for planning as a profession. We want to restore the place of planning as a unique form of service for the community and a noble calling. Too often, today, planning officers are caught in the crossfire between regional targets and local opposition. I want them to have the space and opportunity to get on with what called them to the profession in the first place - the chance to work with communities, to think for the long term, to create distinctive places.

Planning is also about creating the right conditions for economic success - because well-designed places represent a far better use of money, public and private. People are more likely to want to live in and invest in well-designed places than poorly-designed ones.

And planning is, at heart, a civilised enterprise. With the extraordinary natural and historic heritage around us, with our desire to grow, and with our commitment to taking responsibility for our impact on the environment, it's vital to have means of mediating between different needs and imperatives that is organised and transparent and fair.

So I want to say thank you to CPRE. We wouldn't have the planning system as we know it today without the CPRE decades of advocacy, firing up the grass roots, and encouraging and challenging political leaders.

The 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, whose broad principles still inform great elements of the current and future system, owes a tremendous debt to the Campaign's way of thinking. Decades later, you helped swing the debate to ""put plans first"" through the 1990 Act. And after 85 years, you continue to be an essential voice in debate. I'm greatly encouraged that in many instances your concerns and the Government's coincide.

With ""Planning for People"", back in 1999, you galvanised the debate about how best to involve communities in planning, putting them ""at the heart of decisions which affect their quality of life"" - the essence of the Big Society a good decade before that phrase was coined. In 2006, you argued that it was time to end the unnecessary, meddlesome and ugly intrusion of clutter in our streets and countryside - our Secretary of State and the Transport Secretary could not agree more, and last summer signalled their desire for a return to straightforward, clear signage, and no more of it than is needed.

Today, I welcome the constructive role that the CPRE are playing in debate about the Bill. Shaun [Spiers, CPRE Chief Executive] was kind enough to give evidence at the Committee the other week, and it was encouraging to hear him say that the Campaign ""overwhelmingly support""  the Bill as a whole. Not without qualification, and not without a desire to test the detail of proposals, of course.

Shaun raised, for example, the third party right of appeal. This was an idea floated in consultation documents by both political parties currently in government before the last election. We have looked at it long and hard as we have pulled this Bill together, and come to the conclusion that we want, in essence, to be more ambitious.

The thrust of our proposals is to put decisions first. To get to an approach that is much more consensual and less acrimonious. To push for plans that are properly and comprehensively thought through, with the active involvement and participation of local people. We want a system that is genuinely about thinking for the long term about an area's future needs, and not ""development control"" - saying ""yes"" or ""no"" individual applications piecemeal.

Now, given that is where we want to get to, it seems paradoxical to give communities the right to challenge development that is consistent with the plans that they themselves have debated and agreed on. It would be to assume we would fail, and to plan for that failure.

But this measure is the exception rather than the rule - in as much as with most of the rest of the Bill, the differences between us are, by and large, more about detail than about principle.

We both agree that planning enforcement rules need to be tightened up, so that when communities make decisions about what should happen in their area, they can be confident that those decisions will be respected, and that it will be much easier for communities to enforce their choices with greater muscularity.

Or take the importance of sustainable development. We both agree that it is vital to require development to be sustainable - setting the bar in such a way that allows for growth, but that demands growth be properly managed, consistent with plans, and compliant with environmental standards. This idea will be at the heart of the National Planning Policy Framework.

The topic I want to say a little more about today is neighbourhood plans. I welcome very much the support that CPRE have given to the principle of putting power in the hands of local people, and giving them the opportunity to have a say over the look and feel of the places where they live.

Neighbourhood planning will be a very powerful tool. If local people's decisions are confirmed by a simple majority in a local referendum, then the local authority will be required to respect them and give them effect.

Our proposals have much in common with many of the points raised in your charter for planning reform, and in your joint work with Civic Voice from last November.

You called for an important role for parishes: in many places, we envisage that parishes will be best placed to lead the local debate.

You said that neighbourhood plans should be relevant everywhere: we think that they are just as applicable to urban areas as to rural ones, and in cities local people will be able to make common cause through a neighbourhood forum.

But you also raised a number of questions about how, exactly, these proposals would work. And, if you'll allow me, I would like to give some reassurance.

You asked - how will local groups be able to access support and advice to produce high-quality, workable plans? There are two parts to our answer on this. The first is that we start from the assumption that if you give people their head, and the space to make their own decisions, they are more than capable of being imaginative, rational, careful and kind. An assumption that people can't cope for themselves is at the root of centralism and a surefire starting point for designing a system that will imprison, not liberate, initiative and enthusiasm.

But we also recognise that planning can call for complex technical assessments and specialist skills. Local authorities will be under a duty to provide support to communities who want to do neighbourhood planning. As this would represent a new burden on authorities, at a time of constrained budgets, we would be providing appropriate support. We also know that some communities will want to call on independent advice, including on how you get people enthused, reach different parts of the community, or express complex ideas simply. We have invited charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups to bid for a share of funding, worth £3m a year for the next two years - so that that independent advice will be there when it's needed.

You asked - where do neighbourhood plans fit in with other plans? Neighbourhood plans pass unprecedented influence and power to a very local level. Let's be clear, though, that they are not an entirely blank slate. The legislation makes clear that we expect neighbourhood plans to be consistent with strategic elements of local plan, including the need for economic development. (And by the way this makes it even more important for local authorities who have been dragging their heels in producing their own plans to get a move on.) Put plainly: if there's a pressing need for more houses in the wider local area, neighbourhood planning isn't a means for a particular parish to refuse any development altogether. If there is a piece of nationally important infrastructure due to be sited in the area, as decided by democratically accountable Ministers, then neighbourhood plans are not a means to block it.

But within these parameters, there is very wide discretion about what plans can do and say - the level of detail they can go into, and how comprehensive local people choose to make them. For example - they can, if they wish, give permission for more development than is envisaged under the local authority's plan. In some rural areas, for example, we know that communities may be keen to smooth the way for discrete and clearly defined small amounts of increased housing. And I think they are more likely to do this when they have the reassurance of proper recognition and support.

The third question you ask is - how can we make the process of neighbourhood planning as open, democratic and jargon-free as possible? I start like you from the conviction that, wherever possible, public bodies should speak plainly. It behoves a Government committed to putting power in people's hands to explain in clear terms how they can get involved.

It boggles the mind that we have a set of planning guidance, policy, circulars and statements longer than the Complete Works of Shakespeare. As we review and improve that policy and guidance - with the aim of producing a single, shorter document setting out the Government's priorities for the planning system - we will want to make it clearer and more straightforward too.

So, too, with neighbourhood planning, I am absolutely clear that it must be implemented in a way that makes it easy for people to get involved. I agree with the Campaign that in due course it will be vital to have an explanation of neighbourhood planning that is written in very simple, plain English. But what's clear is that there are many places and people who are already keen to get on and do it, and this hugely encouraging. Given CPRE's understanding of the grass roots, your skills at mobilising people, and your long track record of talking sense on planning, I believe this can represent a significant opportunity for you.

I began by saying the Localism Bill is the keystone of our legislative proposals to put power in local people's hands. Neighbourhood planning is a flagship measure in that Bill. Your members' expertise and experience could help enthuse, inform and inspire local communities about the new opportunities that will be opening up for them. I very much hope that we will be able to continue to work together in the months to come.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,,,,,10-Feb-2011,improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

There's nothing milk and honey about localism. There's nothing easy about it - there's no guidance manual. That isn't really the point. Localism won't deliver homogenous, bland, uniform public services. This is about pushing power outwards, downwards as far as possible. And all the possibilities that arise from local communities seizing power themselves. And taking on the responsibilities and the consequences of getting things right and getting them wrong. So localism is red in tooth and claw.

> ""My message is it's time to wake up. Because if you don't localism will have moved on without you.""

For the past decade or so everybody's been singing in favour of localism. No one could get enough of the grassroots and how could you be against the grassroots? But in reality Secretary of States handed out their gold stars to councils doing a really good job at jumping through bureaucratic hoops. And wrote encouraging notes to the ones that were getting better at meeting central targets. We moved from local government making democratically accountable decisions - to local management of services.

Now the Government is putting councils back into the driving seat. So they can go their own way. This seems to alarm people enormously. The most terrifying phrase that is thrown against the localism agenda is 'postcode lottery'. There's an idea that if public services are different in one part of the country that this is inherently evil. This rather spurious argument seems to go that if differences arise by chance - that's okay. But if a Councils makes a decision to do things differently - then that's not fair.

Well I don't think rigid uniformity equalled fairness. And if local areas want to prioritise different services because that's what suits their local area's needs, then that's a good idea. We should become comfortable with the truth - that Cornwall is different from Canterbury, and Reading from Redcar - and Norfolk from just about anywhere else in the universe. So I'm happy for them all to drive off in different directions.

My role, the role of central government is to remove any obstacles and create the right conditions for local decision making. Our Localism Bill - currently in the House of Lords - will give councils the legal confidence to act in their residents' best interests rather than relying on specific powers. Councils will get a 'general power of competence' - legal shorthand for cutting central government's leash.

We'll also cut red tape. Put an end to thousands of Whitehall targets, to monitoring and inspection. And we're handing over control of the purse strings and ending ringfencing. Community Budgets are the start of councils and local areas getting a single pot of funding from Government, to spend as they see fit. But I have to say one thing that struck me on Community Budgets. At first I thought it was about putting money together. But it's about power. It's actually about one agency accepting and agreeing with another.

Retention of business rates will give councils a direct stake in the local economy. Councils will get the powers and incentives to do what local voters want them to do.

But I still hear arguments that we can't afford to do localism now. It's true the country's credit cards are maxed out. And as with a credit card bill, the longer you leave to pay it off, the worse it gets. But that's why we can't afford not to do localism now. When times are tight, people deciding where the money is spent should be people who know and understand their communities - not me.

Councils' revenue spending will still be nearly £53bn this year. And councils have a choice. They can panic - and salami slice services. Or they use their new freedoms to ask big questions about how services are run. And if they offer the best possible value to the taxpayer. Most councils have taken the second option.

Take the £50bn procurement spend across local government. We've put out research by industry experts Opera Solutions today - that backs up estimates made by local government itself - showing councils could save 10 to 20 per cent in procurement spending. That's £10billion a year. Opera tested their theory across three adjoining councils just looking at spending on energy, mobile phone and legal services. By taking the best price for the same goods and using consolidated spending these councils could shave a collective £1.4m off their bills - a 10 per cent reduction.

This isn't a criticism of local councils - corporate bodies face exactly the same problems. My department is not immune to that. But attitudes need to be more commercial.

The top three tips that come out of this research are:

  1. compare your spending with your neighbours
  2. join forces and bulk buy
  3. and shop around so you get the best deal

Things every council can do.

The Local Government Group's own productivity programme is also supporting councils to do things differently starting with quick wins like e-auctions and recovering duplicated payments. To longer-term change such as better asset management and building better business relationships with suppliers. The best public bodies don't assume they have to do things the way they always have. Deliver the same old services in the same way.

It's disappointing recent data  has revealed that only 29 per cent of local councils currently share back office operations such as finance and Human Resources. We can do better than that. And councils are showing the way across the country.

In Sussex, Adur are one of the first councils to set up a partnership working scheme with neighbouring Worthing by sharing management services and a single Chief Executive. Four years on, they have extended this to nearly all their services including bin collections, financial services, legal, planning, parks, IT. With an annual spending power of just over £10m - Adur have already made over £2m in savings and anticipate ongoing annual savings of £1.5m.

Bury Council have taken the initiative on fraud after realising that nearly 70 per cent of blue badges they issued belonged to persons who were deceased. They drew up new procedures to cut down on any fraudulent abuse and save at least £4,000 a year. With the National Fraud Authority recently revealing that councils could save £2bn a year improving their prevention, detection and recovery of fraud - every step like this is important.

Cornwall Council made sure that out of the £170m savings they identified within a week of the Comprehensive Spending Review, that £9 out of every £10 came from efficiency savings. Including streamlining their waste collection contracts from six to one council wide contract - saving £3m.

And you don't need to have a unitary council - which have been expensive and time consuming to create - in order to share services. Do we for example need over 350 different business rate collection departments across England, when the policy is generally just to collect the bills on time?

It's important that there remains democratic accountability, and services are responsive to the ballot box. But I am certain that if councils improved their procurement and joint working on waste services, councils could afford to offer more frequent and regular rubbish collections.

Adur, Bury, Cornwall - that's an ABC of can do councils protecting the services their communities value with creative thinking. And last week I was in South Tyneside where I saw the great relationship they have with BT. I want to encourage more of this kind of thing. It leaves me in no doubt that local communities have the talent and initiative, to harness the new powers coming their way.

And if people are still concerned that all this untrammelled freedom is going to leave councils answering to no one - let me reassure them. I'm not removing accountability. But instead of being accountable to me, councils are accountable to their residents - their electorate. Transparency is at the heart of this - letting residents see for themselves where their tax money is going. All councils bar one are publishing their spending data over £500. The best remedy for discovering and stamping out fraud, waste and duplication. We are also working with local authorities to improve the way the data is published to make it more accessible and usable. Anyone who thinks asking councils to do this isn't localism is missing the point.

Localism won't work if councils just take all the power off central government - power needs to go as far out as possible. Something, which I say with a lot of respect, the recent Select Committee report didn't seem to comprehend. Local people have got to be able to hold their local bodies to account and make sure their needs are being represented. Which is why the Localism Bill isn't just about council freedoms. Residents will get to decide for themselves what their area looks like. Community groups will get new rights to save or take over treasured local assets like shops, pubs and post offices. And people will be able to hold local referendums on issues that matter to them.

As this landmark Bill makes its way through Parliament, to anyone who is still complaining that it's too centralist or not centralist enough - because I still hear complaints there isn't enough guidance and direction. My message is it's time to wake up. Because if you don't localism will have moved on without you. Powers will have passed to local communities and they'll be using them. They'll be demanding action from their council too.

So it's an exciting time to be in local government if you went in because you wanted to listen to people's needs and act on them. If you just wanted to follow directions and get a pat on the back if you put the right tick in the right box, well that time is gone. This is a time of big challenges and big opportunities. It's not a time for sleepwalkers. Localism is happening and if you want to grasp it - the sky is the limit. This is a real opportunity to be responsible to local needs, that's why you got involved and that's an honourable thing to do.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"KPMG, 15 Canada Square",,,,15-Jun-2011,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area,giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

I am today introducing the Localism Bill to Parliament. The legislation will set the foundations for the big society by radically transforming the relationships between central government, local government, communities and individuals. The provisions will devolve greater power and freedoms to councils and neighbourhoods, establish powerful new rights for communities, revolutionise the planning system, and give communities much more control over housing decisions.

The Bill will expand councils' freedom to act in the interest of their local communities through a new general power of competence. This long-awaited new power will mean that rather than needing to rely on specific powers, councils will have the legal reassurance and confidence to innovate and drive down costs to deliver more efficient services.

Powers for councils will be accompanied by greater powers for local people to hold their local authorities to account and to shape their local area. There will be a new right to challenge to take over services; a new right to bid to buy assets of community value such as libraries, public houses and shops; and a new right to veto excessive council tax rises through a referendum.

The Bill also contains significant reform of the planning system. It will replace the Infrastructure Planning Commission with an efficient and democratically accountable system for major infrastructure. It will enable regional planning to be swept away and, in its place, neighbourhood plans will become the new building blocks of the planning system with communities having the power to grant planning permission if a majority of electors are in favour.

The Bill will return decision-making powers on housing to local councils, giving them much greater control over allocation and tenure of social housing and the flexibility to use their social housing stock to the maximum effect and reduce waiting lists. It will enable a new national home swap scheme that will make it easier for social tenants to relocate. The housing revenue account subsidy system will be replaced with a more transparent system that serves local communities. The Tenant Services Authority will be abolished but its vital economic regulation functions will be preserved.

The Bill will create powerful incentives for economic growth by allowing local authorities to grant discretionary business rate discounts. Its provisions will also make small business tax breaks easier to take advantage of and give affected businesses a greater say in rate supplements.

Finally, the Bill will take forward a new settlement for London which will devolve significant power to the Greater London authority and London boroughs and streamline the plethora of agencies in London's public sector landscape.

Taken together, the measures in the Bill will give local government the freedom and powers to deliver the key front-line services people rely on and make important savings.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,13-Dec-2010,,,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr Eric Pickles):

On 6 July 2010, the Coalition Government revoked all regional strategies under section 79(6) of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009. This action was challenged in the High Court by developer Cala Homes, and the decision today concluded that Section 79 powers could not be used to revoke all Regional Strategies in their entirety.

Whilst respecting the court's decision this ruling changes very little. Later this month, the Coalition Government will be introducing the Localism Bill to Parliament, which will sweep away the last Government's controversial regional strategies. It is clear that top-down targets do not build homes - they have just led to the lowest peacetime house building rates since 1924, and have fuelled resentment in the planning process that has slowed everything down.

On 27 May 2010, the Government wrote to local planning authorities and to the Planning Inspectorate informing them of the Coalition Government's intention to rapidly abolish regional strategies and setting out its expectation that the letter should be taken into account as a material planning consideration in any decisions they were currently taking. That advice still stands.

Today, the Government's Chief Planner has written to all local planning authorities and the Planning Inspectorate confirming that they should have regard to this material consideration in any decisions they are currently taking.

Moreover, to illustrate the clear policy direction of the Coalition Government, the proposed clause of the Localism Bill that will enact our commitment to abolish regional strategies is being placed in the Library. The Bill is expected to begin its passage through Parliament before Christmas.

We are determined to return decision-making powers in housing and planning to local authorities and the communities they serve, alongside powerful incentives so that people see the benefits of building. We will very shortly provide more details about one of the most important such incentives - the New Homes Bonus Scheme, which will come into effect from April. This means that new homes delivered now will be rewarded under the scheme.

The Coalition Government remains firmly resolved to scrap the last Government's imposition of confusing and bureaucratic red tape. This was a clear commitment made in the Coalition Agreement and in the general election manifestoes of both Coalition parties. We intend to deliver on it.

Minister for Housing and Local Government (The Rt Hon Grant Shapps):

Following the Spending Review, I am today announcing further details of the new 'Affordable Rent' model to be offered by Private Registered Providers of Social Housing (hereafter referred to as housing associations) from April 2011.

We must make far better use of existing social housing - ensuring that we target support where it is needed most. The Government published a policy paper, _Local decisions: a fairer future for social housing_ on 22 November 2010. The Localism Bill will take forward radical reforms, including flexible tenancies and changes to the way social housing is allocated. The Government has given a clear commitment to ensure that the existing tenancies and rents of secure and assured tenants of social landlords are protected and respected in these reforms.

The Bill will contain a wide-ranging package of reforms that will devolve greater power and freedoms to councils and neighbourhoods, establish powerful new rights for communities, revolutionise the planning system, and give communities control over housing decisions.

Given the huge pressures on public finances we must also ensure that we get more for the money we invest in new social homes. Alongside the Bill, the introduction of Affordable Rent will represent a significant first step towards giving social landlords much greater freedom to respond to local housing need.

The Homes and Communities Agency will publish a full framework document early next year that will form the basis for bids from providers who are interested in offering Affordable Rent.

### Overview

Affordable Rent is designed to:

  * maximise the delivery of new social housing by making the best possible use of constrained public subsidy and the existing social housing stock
  * provide an offer which is more diverse for the range of people accessing social housing, providing alternatives to traditional social rent

Affordable Rent falls within the definition of social housing in section 68 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (and, in particular, the definition of low cost rental accommodation in section 69 of that Act). Affordable Rent properties will therefore be subject to regulation by the Tenant Services Authority - and its Homes and Communities Agency successor - where they are provided by a Registered Provider.

Affordable Rent will offer housing associations the flexibility to convert vacant social rent properties to Affordable Rent at re-let, at a rent level of up to 80 per cent of market rent. Housing associations will be able to convert vacant properties to Affordable Rent where they have reached an investment agreement with the Home and Communities Agency about how additional rental income will be reinvested in the supply of new affordable housing.

The Homes and Communities Agency has a capital budget of almost £4.5bn over the Spending Review period to fund affordable housing supply, of which around £2bn will support the delivery of new Affordable Rent homes (the total also includes £2.3bn to meet existing commitments). While grant funding will primarily target Affordable Rent, there may be some scope for delivery of Low Cost Home Ownership as part of the agreements, where this is appropriate for local circumstances and helps to promote the overall supply of affordable homes. Ministers intend to make the payment of grant funding conditional on transparency.

Agreements could also involve approval in principle for future asset management plans that include social housing disposals, subject to the need for statutory consent and consultation with the relevant local authorities. The Tenant Services Authority will need to be engaged in the process to ensure that providers can continue to meet its regulatory standards, including on viability.

### Allocation

We envisage that Affordable Rent properties will be allocated in the same way that social rent properties are now. The existing regulatory obligation on associations to co-operate with local authorities' strategic housing function on the allocation of social rent properties will also apply to Affordable Rent. Similarly we envisage that existing lettings arrangements operated by local authorities and housing associations will continue to apply and that Affordable Rent properties will - where appropriate - be made available through choice-based lettings.

The statutory and regulatory framework for allocations provides scope for local flexibility. Local authorities and associations may wish to exercise this discretion in relation to Affordable Rent in order to meet local needs and priorities in the most effective way possible (for example, through the adoption of appropriate local lettings policies).

### Rent

Affordable Rent properties will not be subject to the rent restructuring policy that applies to social rented housing. This policy was originally outlined by the previous government in March 2001 (in the _Guide to Social Rent Reforms_) and implemented by the then Housing Corporation (via the _Rent Influencing Regime Guidance_ published by the Corporation in October 2001). The previous government's direction to the Tenant Services Authority issued in November 2009 required the regulator to set a standard on rent that reflected the same policy.

In particular, the direction required the Tenant Services Authority, when setting a standard on rents, to have regard to the Social Rent Guidance. The direction defined the term 'Social Rent Guidance' as the _Guide to Social Rent Reforms_ published in March 2001 ""_and any guidance issued by the Department, or its successors, in relation to that document_."" This statement should be treated as guidance issued in relation to the March 2001 document. The direction also obliged the Tenant Services Authority to set a rent standard with a view to achieving, so far as possible, the target rent policy set out in the Rent Influencing Regime Guidance.

This statement clarifies that Affordable Rent properties are not covered by the Government's rent restructuring policy. Note that a property is only considered to be 'Affordable Rent' for these purposes where it is linked to an agreement with the Homes and Communities Agency on investment.

Housing associations will be able to let an Affordable Rent property (whether a converted void or new build) at _up to_ 80 per cent of market rent for an equivalent property for that size and location. The association's calculation of the market rent would need to be based on a residential lettings estimate for a property of the appropriate size, condition and area. Valuations should be in accordance with a RICS recognised method.

The maximum annual rent increase on an Affordable Rent property will be RPI + 0.5 per cent. However associations will be required to rebase the rent on each occasion that a new tenancy agreement is issued (or renewed) for an Affordable Rent property. This requirement, which _overrides_ the RPI + 0.5 per cent limit, is designed to ensure that the rent set at the beginning of each new tenancy is no higher than 80 per cent of the market rent.

### Tenure

The Government has already published radical proposals to give greater flexibility to both local authority and housing association landlords over the types of tenure they can offer to social housing tenants1. In particular, the Government believes that it is no longer right to require that every social tenancy should be for life - regardless of the household's particular circumstances. The aim is to create a more flexible system so that scarce public resource can be focused on those who need it most.

The Affordable Rent model is the first step towards delivering these wider reforms. Housing associations will be able to offer Affordable Rent on fixed term tenancies, but they will also retain the option to offer lifetime tenancies should they wish to do so. We would expect associations to use this additional flexibility to ensure that help and support are focused on those who need it most when they need it most, and to build strong and cohesive communities. They will need to meet the existing regulatory requirement to publish clear and accessible policies which outline their approach to tenancy management.

The Government is currently consulting on its wider tenure reform proposals for social housing, including on the rights and protections that should be available to tenants as part of these changes. These proposals include a minimum fixed term of two years for all general needs social tenancies, the Right to Acquire for tenants with a fixed term tenancy of two years or more (subject to the existing conditions and exceptions) and changes to succession rights2. Some of the proposals will require primary legislation and we intend to deliver these through the Localism Bill. The final proposals, once implemented (either by legislation or regulation), will apply to fixed term tenancies that are subsequently issued for both Affordable Rent and traditional social rent.

However we envisage that the first Affordable Rent properties will be let during 2011-12, before the wider tenure reform proposals are due to come on stream. We have therefore considered which of the proposed conditions should be attached to the Affordable Rent model from the start. It should be noted that the proposals that require primary legislation (e.g. on the Right to Acquire) cannot be brought forward in this way.

We wish to apply the following (non-statutory) conditions to the Affordable Rent model:

(a) a minimum fixed term of two years for Affordable Rent tenancies; and

(b) where a landlord decides, in line with its published policy, not to reissue an Affordable Rent tenancy at the end of the fixed term, the landlord should provide advice and assistance to help the tenant find suitable alternative accommodation. Landlords and tenants may wish to consider a range of 'end of tenancy' options depending on the needs of the household concerned. This could include selling the property to the tenant via conversion to shared ownership (subject to consent).

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I'm going to avoid all the obvious jokes about Guy Fawkes night.

No corny remarks about blowing up parliament or references to a bonfire of the quangos.

I'll just stick to my little sparkler of a speech.

But I do just want to make one point before I start.

I was delighted to hear yesterday that the FBU had called off its strike which would have covered Bonfire Night and Diwali. I am glad that common sense has prevailed.

I think that a lot of people here today will have had grave reservations about the proposed strike. I hope the unions and employers can resolve this dispute in a more constructive way, without resorting to industrial action.

Let me get back to the main event.

There's no denying the recent financial settlement was tough for councils. And you all knew it would be.

But though councils have less money - you also have far more power.

More influence. More choices. More opportunities. More freedom than you've had in decade. In truth more power than for a quarter of a century.

So make no mistake.

Even if the coffers were overflowing.

We'd still be doing this.

We'd still be passing power out - to local councils and to local communities.

Because it's big government as well as big spending that got us into this financial mess.

And if you want to run better public services.

If you want to have a dynamic economy.

If you want to have strong local communities.

Then you don't control everything from on high.

You need to put power back where it belongs.

You give councils control of the purse strings and let them make the decisions.

You stop tying councillors up with red tape and regulation and let them get on with it.

You give people a genuine reason to get involved in their community - in the knowledge that they can actually make a difference.

That's what this settlement was about - power and influence as well as the raw figures.

It's about making local communities stronger.

We've had more than a decade of central government pulling the strings. Look where it got us.

It's time to give local government a try.

And London is showing how it's done.

You get Redbridge - more open, more honest, more transparent - really getting the community involved in difficult choices.

You get Camden and Islington - looking at saving the public thousands of pounds by sharing a chief executive and senior management.

You get Hammersmith and Fulham, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea - demonstrating the future of local public services.

London councils are taking the lead.

Showing the future of local government.

And I believe that all of you can rise to this challenge.

All of you can innovate, save money - and give your residents a better deal.

Because the shackles of central government have been removed.

For the first time in living memory, you can genuinely make a difference to the lives of your residents.

Now that you don't have the targets, the forms and the inspections to worry about.

You can get on with worrying about what your residents want.

And there are lots of areas where you will be in a stronger position by working together.  
Take pensions.

London boroughs control 33 pension funds worth something like £19 billion pounds.

Some councils are already working together to better manage their funds.

And something like £60 million could be saved if all pension funds were being run at the standard of the best.

Isn't it about London councils look seriously at safeguarding their employees pensions through partnerships?

But there's no reason why shared services should stop in the back office.

What we're seeing in West London is three councils at the cutting edge of innovation.

Not just sharing HR, finance and buildings but looking at adult social care and children's services too.

Of course, there's been a lot of rubbish talked about 'mergers' and 'super-councils'.

Nobody sensible is suggesting that's on the table at all.

No-one's saying that Kensington and Chelsea is going to be hoovered up, or that Islington is going to be taken-over.

Local identity, local accountability, local sovereignty is still paramount.

In fact, residents shouldn't notice the difference at all - except that they should get better, more consistent local services.

A massive power shift is going on here. Localism is no longer a dirty word - it's the only show in town.

After being the prisoner of central government for decade, this is now your time to shine and bask in the sun.

And I know some people find it hard to believe.

But this is real. This is happening.

I haven't secretly got a hundred targets up my sleeve which I'll produce if you don't do exactly as I want.

I'm letting you get on with it.

And if you don't deliver, it won't be me turning up to darken your doorstep.

It will be your voters.

We've got a new balance of power now.

It means a new relationship between you and your residents.

Instead of turning to me asking 'what should we do, Secretary of State?' 'am I doing this right?' - you need to be asking them that question.

But you can only do that if you are genuinely open and transparent.

If you are prepared to be challenged and held to account.

But if you are confident in your decisions, if you believe in what you are doing, there's no reason why you should need to hide behind closed doors.

Fifteen London councils have already put their spending online - so why can't the others? What have you got you got to hide?

This new balance of power also means a new relationship between you and me.

I have spent a long time in local government. I trust you. I support you. And I want to be able to discuss the really difficult issues openly and honestly.

One of those is housing benefit - and what that will mean in London.

It's raising a lot of questions and speculation. But let's remember what we're really talking about.

Fairness.

Is it fair that people's taxes are being used to give other people 30, 40, 50 grand a year for housing benefit?

Is it fair that there hard working families living in your wards who can only dream of the homes enjoyed by some people living on benefits?

Is it surprising that this causes a lot of resentment?

It is time to live in the real world.

Housing benefit has gone up by £5 billion just in the last five years - up by 50 per cent in the last ten years.

It's not only unfair - it's completely unaffordable.

And we've got to be able to talk about this without the debate being hijacked by outlandish claims which only serve to whip up public hysteria.

There's no doubt that there are tough times ahead. Difficult choices to make.

But you know and I know that we can't make sensible, fair decisions, if we resort to myths and hysteria instead of the facts.

We need a discussion, not a media feeding frenzy.

You've got all these new powers, all this new influence.

Voters will want you to use them responsibly and sensibly.

London has a world-wide reputation for creativity, for innovation, for dynamism.

This great capital city needs councils who will live up to that reputation.

And I'm looking forward to seeing what you do.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London",,,,6-Nov-2010,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The Public Bodies Review (20 October 2010) concluded that the functions of the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation (LTGDC) should be transferred to the relevant local authority or other London bodies. I am today announcing the first stage of that localisation. From 1 April 2011, LTGDC's planning functions in the London Riverside area will be returned to the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Havering, and for part of Newham. This important first step towards complete localisation will be effected by the _London Thames Gateway Development Corporation (Planning Functions) (Amendment) Order 2011_ which I am laying before Parliament today. The order reflects the coalition commitment to cutting the costs of quangos and increasing accountability, and also chimes with our approach to the Thames Gateway generally, where we have decentralised strategic oversight to local political leaders.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/1824475,Making neighbourhood planning work,"* * *

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Planning is more than a job: it is a vocation. It helps people articulate their aspirations and ambitions for the place where they live. It promotes local prosperity, safeguards the environment, and expresses the unique character that makes different places special. This is a unique and incredibly valuable form of public service.

So it's a tragedy that over-centralisation has led many people today to see the planning system in a poor light. Regional strategies and housing targets have succeeded not in boosting development but in generating antagonism. Bureaucratic procedures have put unnecessary hurdles in the way of local authorities preparing plans. Too many planning officers spend their time looking at individual applications on a case-by-case basis, rather than thinking creatively and imaginatively about local people's long-term needs. In some senses, in fact, frontline professionals have been the first victims - bearing the brunt of local people's resentment at a system that does not always feel like it is on their side.

The Government is committed to profound reform. The Localism Bill, currently before parliament, will scrap regional targets, do away with unnecessary bureaucracy, and allow people at a very local level to exercise more power than ever before.

Instead of imposing on people, we want to give them the opportunity to make their own choices through neighbourhood planning. Through the community infrastructure levy and the new homes bonus, we will ensure that that those neighbourhoods which choose to grow feel the benefits of that decision. Our aim is to give people real choice, real influence, and real reasons to say ""yes"" to development.

I want at this point to say thank you because the Planning Officers Society has already done much to inform our proposals. Your constructive input - including your paper at the end of October - has been very helpful as we've finessed and refined our plans. Many of the points that you made then - about the importance of local plans, about the crucial role of parishes, the need for leadership in planning authorities - are reflected in our proposals.

But I also know that as planners care more than anyone that these proposals should translate successfully into practice: and that you will wish to test, rightly so, exactly how neighbourhood planning will work. Of course that's what today is all about, your chance to question the Chief Planner Steve Quartermain and the Department's brightest and best planning minds about the detail. I want to address some of the key questions of principle upfront.

First, will people really want to get involved? The principle of involving and consulting people has been written into planning guidance since the 1960s. Authorities have, at times, struggled to get people involved in a positive way. And the stereotype goes that planning is the preserve of the sharp-elbowed middle classes. Now from my experience as a councillor I don't think that's accurate or fair. But I accept that authorities may see the same familiar faces commenting on numerous issues, while others decline to take part.

Neighbourhood planning is perfectly conceived to encourage greater involvement and from a wider range of people. The question of what happens to the village green, or the estate down the road, will feel far more direct and meaningful to most members of the public than the abstractions and high-level objectives of regional strategies.

What's more, this is an opportunity not to be ""consulted then ignored,"" but to wield real power. Valid neighbourhood development plans, confirmed by a simple majority of the neighbourhood in a local referendum, must be brought into force by local authorities.

And the proof is in the pudding: there's a pent-up desire to get on and do it, with a number of neighbourhood keen to lead the way.

The second question is, who will decide which local groups and bodies can do neighbourhood planning? One councillor described this to me as the ""brass band"" problem. In a town with two brass bands, which should represent local people in the county fair?

In the context of neighbourhood planning - what happens when two different groups in one geographic area claim to be the best representative of local opinion, and want to become the neighbourhood forum?

It will be up to the local authority to decide between competing proposals. They may not be able to please all of the people, all of the time. And in the past it has been very convenient to be able to say, truthfully, ""my hands are tied"" and to pass hot potatoes up to Whitehall. But as central government makes room for much greater discretion to a local level, we expect local authorities to show leadership.

Third, what does this mean for the local authority plan? Throughout all the proposed changes, the importance of high-quality, well-designed local plans is a constant. If anything, they will matter more.

With the abolition of regional strategies, local plans will show where and how different authorities intend to make common cause on strategic planning issues.

And they will set the wider context for neighbourhood plans. It is important for people to have the opportunity to express their ambitions for their very local area, but it's also important that those ambitions are consistent with the needs and ambitions of the residents of the wider area.

So those authorities who have complete or well-developed plans should continue to use them, and those who do not should look to make swift progress as a matter of urgency.

The fourth question is, what does neighbourhood planning mean for our elected members?

It's an often-repeated claim that that passing power to local people undermines locally elected representatives. But it is based on a basic misunderstanding of local democracy.

Neighbourhood forums, local activists' groups, residents' forums and the like don't stop councillors doing their job. In as much as they make the area more prosperous and vibrant, they help councillors.

In a similar way, neighbourhood planning is an opportunity for locally elected representatives. They will be able to work with local people, to help them express themselves, to lead and inform the debate in the best interests of the local area. Councillors should not feel left out, they should get stuck in.

Fifth, and crucially, where are the resources coming from? Local authorities, like the rest of the public sector, are facing tight budgets. Against this backdrop, we recognise that neighbourhood planning - adapting to a new system, and meeting the duty to provide technical support and assistance to communities - is a new demand that needs to be properly resourced.

Central government will be providing support local authorities to make neighbourhood planning a real success story. In parallel, we will be inviting organisations including voluntary groups and social enterprises, to make bids on a fund to support local communities in the neighbourhood planning process.

But it's not just about the money. And this brings me to my final point today - which is a challenge to you and your colleagues.

I believe there are huge opportunities for planners in the Localism Bill: freedom from regional imposition, greater scope to draw up plans without undue interference from inspectors, and the chance to forge a new relationship with local communities. This is a great time to be in the profession.

But making the most of this moment is going to require not just doing different things, but doing things differently. Your role is fundamental to delivering the Big Society and localism - enabling, supporting, mediating, collaborating, explaining options, finding solutions. Being a visionary.

This militates in favour of innovation, collaboration, passing down power. It means finding new approaches to working with communities, local business, residents, schools, service providers and young people. And it also means ""letting go"" of some traditional ways of working.

So I'm keen to work with the planning and development profession over the next few months - to understand the good things that you are already doing, and hear your successes - to make sure that we get not just the right mechanisms, but the right culture too, to put planning where it belongs - in the public's trust and esteem and at the heart of the Big Society.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,"One Great George Street, London",,,,24-Jan-2011,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

This Government inherited a toxic financial legacy. Record public deficit - with unsustainable spending.

We're spending £43bn a year just to repay interest on the national debt. 1

Meanwhile - as Stuart says - the total income of all the country's voluntary and community groups put together is £35bn. 2

In other words - there's more money going out of the exchequer, simply to stay still on our national debt, as there is coming in to your coffers.

You don't have to be an economist to see that this is unsustainable, and in layman's terms pure lunacy.

We have to do what's responsible. Do what's right. And get public spending under control.

We've taken the tough decisions needed to put the economy on a sound footing.

We've set spending limits for central government.

In the local government settlement, we've done the same for councils.

Now everyone in government - in Whitehall, and the town hall - has had to decide how to respond.

Some have chosen to recognise the immensely important role of the voluntary and community sector.

To value the work you do.

In many cases, voluntary and community groups are transforming the way public services are delivered.

Bringing levels of expertise and care. Imagination and innovation, that rival the very best of the public or private sector.

And in doing so, they offer outstanding value for taxpayers' money.

That's why we've sought, as far possible, to protect our funding to voluntary groups. To safeguard our support for those helping the homeless. And providing care to vulnerable adults.

The best councils have long valued a good relationship with voluntary organisations.

They know that voluntary groups play an invaluable and irreplaceable role within thousands of communities.

They know that your advice and innovation can help shape services.

They know that - instead of annual grant handouts and annual bidding rounds - it makes sense to put you at the heart of service delivery day in, day out. Harnessing your experience and expertise for the benefit of local people.

To give you a say in how services are designed. And, in more and more cases, to hand over the running of those services to you. Giving you a more stable and predictable income.

And these councils know that inflicting disproportionate cuts to the voluntary sector would be incredibly short-sighted.

Thurrock have pledged to continue funding the voluntary sector at the same rate as last year. As have Wolverhampton.

Wiltshire have said that they need flourishing voluntary sector organisations today more than ever before: and that 'to weaken the sector by withdrawing support would be a big mistake'.

Reading are actually increasing the money they give to voluntary groups. And changing the way it's distributed so it's more transparent, consistent, and focused on what the town needs.

And Tendring - tiny Tendring, out on the Essex coast - is completely transforming the way they work with the voluntary sector.

Instead of £50,000 shared between a handful of groups, they are offering half a million which any group with ideas and initiative can bid for. A tenfold increase.

These councils know what they are doing. They didn't wait to be told. They didn't ask for instructions. They just got on with the job.

And if all these councils - North and South, urban and rural, district, metropolitan and unitary; some of them highly dependent on government grants - can do it - there's no reason why others cannot.

But what you and I know is that some councils aren't on the same page as these reforming councils.

They don't seem to get it.

And that is a grave concern to the Government.

I think the way that a council works with the voluntary sector through this testing time is a key test of whether they are really ready for independent, responsible leadership.

I've made it very clear they must resist any temptation to pull up the drawbridge and pass on disproportionate cuts.

And unless they've squeezed out every bit of waste.

Unless they are really sharing back offices.

Unless they've clamped down on senior pay.

Then there's no excuse and no hiding place.

Let me be crystal clear. We have reasonable expectations of how Local Authorities will conduct themselves.

First, it is reasonable to expect that councils will not pass on disproportionate cuts to local voluntary and community groups. That they will not inflict bigger reductions to your budgets than they take on themselves.

Second, any sensible council has known for many months that we were facing tough times - so it is reasonable to expect that they will have been talking to voluntary and community groups at a very early stage about how services need to change.

Third, it is reasonable to expect that they will have given three months' notice or more when they think they need to end or alter a grant, or other support.

And it is reasonable to expect that they use this three months to give local groups a chance to make their case and suggest alternative ways of redesigning or reshaping the service.

So if councils are being high-handed - I'll consider giving our reasonable expectations statutory force.

Because in order to make a success of localism -

In order to enable our towns and neighbourhoods to thrive -

I want to make sure that voluntary and charitable groups have got the confidence, the clout and the power to make their mark.

Whoever you are, whatever you've got to give, we're going to make it easier for you to give it.

That's why we're introducing a whole series of new rights through the localism bill.

The right to challenge the way local services are run - such as children's centres, social care, or even transport.

The community right to buy - with time to come up with a business plan, and find the cash, to run resources like leisure centres and libraries.

The right - through neighbourhood planning - to have a meaningful say over what your hometown will look and feel like in the future.

You know the neighbourhood, you know what people want, you know what's going to work.

The fact is that public services have been run on the Gospel according to the Government for too long. It's stifled innovation and stopped us getting the best results.

So whether parents want to run a new school, residents want to take over the community centre - or big voluntary groups want to run whole public services.

We're not just grudgingly allowing it - we're positively encouraging it.

We are also ushering in a new era of transparency.

Every council should be opening its books.

I want everyone to be able to see how much their council spends on the voluntary sector through grants and payments under contract.

And if you aren't happy with the funding decisions your council is making - let them know.

Ultimately, they are accountable to you.

Finally, we're making it easier for people to play a bigger role in their community.

There's a long and proud tradition in this country of volunteering. As you well know many millions of people make a huge contribution to national life and their local community by sharing their time and expertise.

But there are others who have a great deal to give but find barriers in their way. Red tape. A lack of clear opportunities to do their bit.

Whether they've always been put off by the endless CRB paperwork.

Whether they are teenagers who want to get new opportunities in the National Citizen Service.

Whether they want to become one of our 5,000 organisers.

There's a place in the Big Society for that.

You know, people say it's easier to start a gang than a youth group.

Because the government doesn't regulate gangs.

It doesn't come up with an endless list of rules and requirements.

Hurdles and hoops.

Paperwork and boxes to tick and forms to fill in.

It's no wonder that people get frustrated and give up before they've even begun.

But we can't afford to let the enthusiasm of volunteers, the goodwill of communities, and the successes of the voluntary sector go to waste any more.

So whether your group is made up of a handful of volunteers and a tiny budget who just needs a foot in the door to make a huge difference to your community.

Whether you're a bigger group providing vital local services who wants to expand and improve what you offer.

Or whether you are a multi-million pound organisation with radical ambitions to take over national public services.

Then you are an essential part of the Big Society.

We need to work together to maximise your contribution. And make the most of your potential.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

_Political content has been removed._

When I was a Shadow Minister I heard your calls for Government to stop imposing additional costs on the building industry.

They were consistent, loud and clear.

I'm still hearing them now we're in Government.

So I wanted to take up the NHBC's kind invitation to come and tell you what I'm going to do to answer those calls.

### Addressing the Public Deficit

I know some of you were at the Housing Market Intelligence Conference last month.

There I set out what I thought a better market would look like.

I said that we need to reduce the public deficit, provide powerful incentives to build new homes, streamline planning, and remove a whole raft of regulations.

These steps would put in place the conditions to get the market moving again.

But the first priority had to be acting swiftly to cut the public deficit.

I know that many had become used to feeding of a level of unsustainable public expenditure - but I am afraid it could not last.

No business could survive with the level of debt the Government was carrying and we had to address it as our first priority.

You only have to look to Ireland to see what unsustainable debt can do to a country's economy - and a housebuilding industry.

### The Market

The previous housing and planning policy was also having a dangerous impact on the market.

Neighbourhoods had little incentive to support growth.

Unattainable targets pitted communities against the very idea of building new homes.

The planning system worked in no one's interests.

The additional regulatory costs you were forced to bear were in danger of undermining your businesses.

And when the recession came the market stopped working.

Last year fewer homes were built than in any peacetime year since 1924 and we all know that this year isn't looking any better.

So we have to act quickly to get the market working again - and the New Homes Bonus will provide powerful incentives.

And I would urge you all to respond to that consultation.

But we also need to streamline the planning system and this is on its way too.

Look out for the Localism Bill.

Now we need to get busy lifting the burden of unnecessary regulation and stultifying standards - which holds back the building industry.

The Spending Review committed the Government to reduce the total burden of regulation on house-builders by March 2015. It's a pledge.

That means action - not words.

So I wanted to come here today to set how we will act to rip up the red tape that restricts your business.

### Building Regulations

We are determined to get Building Regs right by reviewing their content with you.

You told us about the changes you think need to be made.

And the feedback we've had so far tells us that, whilst Building Regs might not be perfect, there is no need for a major revamp.

I agree - Building Regs are the bedrock. They are the right mechanism to set national minimum standards, and should remain to make sure buildings are safe, and sustainable.

If something ain't broke don't fix it - we get that.

My colleague, Andrew Stunell will announce the results of the review soon. There are opportunities for deregulation, as well as key areas for review and possible change in 2013.

### New Local Standards Framework

But as you well know, Building Regs are only part of a plethora of additional standards and codes.

And they come with a range of bureaucratic assessment regimes dictated by central Government, various quangos, agencies and advisory bodies. They're sometimes even in conflict with each other.

So today I want to kick off a process for working out how I can help you by further deregulating and de-cluttering.  
To make things simple and less of a burden on your business.

I want to introduce the new idea of a ""local standards framework"" - an idea that will simplify and unify all of the standards.

The principle is that a framework will be a defined menu of technically robust costed standards from which local authorities or neighbourhoods would choose - if they want to set additional standards in their local area.

The ""framework"" will help people make the right choices at the local level.

I can almost hear you thinking - so what's going to be in the framework?

But I'm afraid I can't tell you that - for one simple reason.

I don't know!

Why?

Because that will be up to you to work out.

### Developing the Local Standards Framework

I want the Local Standards Framework to be developed by you - the broad church represented in this room today.

I don't think central Government should determine what the standards specify.

In the spirit of decentralisation I want to ask you to help sort out the mess and to take a leading role in the development of the 'local standards framework'.

You are the people who know most about the impact of regulations and codes. So who better to ask to help deliver a better system?

I am certain you will stress the need to make sure any options proposed don't impose unrealistic burdens.

Burdens that could lead to fewer homes getting built.

If it's going to work the Framework will need to be developed, owned and maintained by those who will use it so we will want to involve local government as well.

The NHBC have offered to help and I am grateful for that and I think others in the industry should also get involved.

Government will play our role in helping - so I'm asking my officials to help you develop the idea and later, to make the Framework bite I think it should be part of planning policy, to make it happen.

### Ripping Up Red Tape

Now I can hear you muttering - that is all well and good but we need action now.

Well, this Government is trying to do what it says:

We said we'd cut the public deficit - we are.

We said we'd cull the quangos - we have.

We said we'd get rid of HIPs - we did.

And I can announce today that the HCA will not implement the new standards they have been working on.

For the meantime the HCA will continue to use existing standards.

This will save an average increase in build costs of £8,000 per unit.

In the long run, the standards that apply to private and public housing should be exactly the same. My ambition is to harmonise standards at the earliest opportunity - I just don't understand why all homes shouldn't be the same great standard.

I am also removing all centrally-imposed standards for houses built on surplus central government land.

Right - so that's a start made in ripping up the red tape.

### Conclusion

Now it's over to you to propose some more.

Yesterday I encouraged council leaders to seek out and destroy red tape that held them back - now I want you to do the same.

So, today, I've sent out a call for action - asking for your help in identifying other bits of red tape that I can rip up.

Obviously we've just been through a review of Building Regulations, so there is no need to repeat your views on those.

But any red tape that impacts on development viability (be it national, local, voluntary, site-specific, or a general business requirement) is fair game.

I am asking you to send me your list by the end of December.

As with your proper Christmas lists, the more specific you can be the better.

But I'm sorry that Santa won't be able to sort out anything on the lists of regulations by Christmas Eve.

There won't be enough time to get the elves to work.

But I'm making an early new year's resolution that I'll spend next year ripping up regulation - why not join me?",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London",,,,25-Nov-2010,making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively,,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

### Introduction

Thank you, Matthew. When I came last year I made sure we had lots of time for questions and I found it really useful - so I am going to do the same again today.

I think it is important that politicians do more listening, and less talking.

When I was in opposition I listened to young families who can't afford to buy their own home.

I met tenants who wanted to move, but can't.

I heard from people who wanted to work but can't afford to because of one hell of a crazy benefit system that rewards people for staying at home and punishes them for working.

I was lobbied by estate agents and house builders who said they were tied down by pointless bureaucratic red tape.

I spoke to Housing Associations who didn't want to jump through hoops any longer, just to pass pointless tick box inspections.

I also heard some great ideas about how things could change from people like you. People who are providing great homes in great neighbourhoods.

I know it can be tough and over the last few years things definitely got tougher and it ain't going to get easier anytime soon.

So we need to face these challenging times together.

### Public expenditure - CSR

I know you are waiting for the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

I can't give any detail, but its no secret that there will be cuts to the housing budget.

I know that over recent years you have got used to Ministers coming to conferences like this and promising to spend x million on y new schemes to reach z target.

But this Government was elected to cut public expenditure to address the deficit and housing must take its share of the burden.

If we don't there is a real threat to the economic future of this country and everyone will suffer.

To put it starkly: if interest rates go through the roof we will see more people losing the roof over their heads.

If inflation soars we all pay more for less but it is the most vulnerable who will suffer most.

So we must cut the deficit but, I think we can also protect frontline services.

### Public scrutiny and efficiency in social housing

So first we all need to scrutinise what we are doing and why?

This Government is putting its own house in order, - we are opening ourselves up to public scrutiny like never before.

This transparency is vital to driving down costs.

So we're publishing all expenditure over £500 on our departments' website.

It is just the start.

I think that anyone who receives public money - whether they are in central Government or Local Authorities… Be they charities or industrial and provident societies… or quangos or Arms Length Bodies - We all need to do the same and embrace a new spirit of openness.

If you receive the public's money it is time to open up your books, so that the public can see how their cash is being spent. Not just once a year in a stuffy and unread annual report, but in real-time.

And yes, they want to know how many people think that their job is tougher than being Prime Minister.

And I want to know how it can be justified to pay enormous salaries which are ultimately being paid for either through the hard work and toil of taxpayers… or worse, from the rents of tenants who maybe the people in society least able to afford your salary.

Of course the public also want to know you are providing a great service with their money.

Social landlords have a tremendous track record of levering in massive private investment to build homes and to support community development - a record I know that you are rightly proud of.

Without you there would be an even bigger shortage of new homes. But with public subsidy reducing, you will need to find another model.

Other ways of doing more for less.

Of course many of you are well down the track at squeezing the efficiency and value from shrinking resources.

I welcome recent reports that have set out ideas to reform social housing finance.

Over the last few decades large amounts of the public's money has been invested in social housing. And for me that goes to the heart of the matter.

How can we get the most out of past, present and future public investment?

Are there opportunities for efficiencies that you can exploit?

Is there scope to sell some assets and re-invest the money in more homes?

How much further can you go by looking for efficiencies and savings?

One thing is for sure - whether we like it or not - there will be no return to the way it was because boom and bust in housing cannot be allowed to happen again.

### TSA regulation

I want to turn to Housing Regulation…

We do need effective economic regulation to make sure we get the maximum punch from the taxpayer's pound.

Investors must have confidence that businesses are properly run.

I have made it clear that our review of the Tenant's Services Authority will deliver this outcome.

I've also made no secret of my view that we don't need a separate multi-million pound national Quango, which spent £40 million pounds in its first year, just to work out that tenants would like their repairs done quickly!

I know we can reduce bureaucracy, achieve value for money and save scarce resources by scaling back the regulatory burden and decentralising power.

Tenants must be able to scrutinise their landlords' performance, and hold them to account.

But inspections are of limited value - if all they amount to is little more than a box ticking exercise.

Put it this way… When it comes to the point where social landlords have actually employed consultants to run mock inspection exercises… in order to learn how to get their boxes ticked… you know something has gone wrong.

Of course tenants know from their own experience when things are going wrong.

So I think we need more tenant led scrutiny. I believe that problems between tenants and landlords are best sorted out at the local level rather than through complex inspection regimes and overregulation.

If tenants are unhappy with the service they get, it should be dealt with quickly by their landlord.

If it isn't fixed, they should be able to go to a tenant panel, their councillors or MP.

If they don't get any joy, then the complaint could be referred to an ombudsman.

It should be as simple as that - a local solution to a local problem.

I will be sharing my conclusions from the review of TSA shortly, and you won't be surprised to learn that the outcome will absolutely reflect the coalition government's commitment to localism.

### Community Right to Build

We are committed to devolving power to the people.

Letting people have control over decisions that affect them.

The Localism Bill which will be introduced later this year will pass an unprecedented amount of power to locals.

Out with top down controls, and in with incentives through the powerful New Homes Bonus - working with the grain of what communities want rather than what Whitehall dictates.

Making sure that a slimmed down Homes and Communities Agency are the people you turn to when you want to get things done or if you like jargon - an enabling agent for change.

I want the Agency to hand more of its power and control away to local communities.

I am not simply referring to the possible transfer of its London functions to the Mayor.

I want all communities to have more of a say in what happens.

I know that The National Housing Federation and Matthew Taylor have been calling for rural housing to be more affordable.

That is precisely what the Community Right to Build will do.

Subject to legislation, we will give rural communities the right to build the housing and community buildings that they know are needed.

As long as there is overwhelming support in their community.

And on the subject of overwhelming support, I have listened to a broad range of views, including representations from the National Housing Federation…

And so today I can announce that I have concluded that rather than requiring 90 per cent of residents to vote in favour of a Community Right to Build project…

We will instead be introducing the scheme with a threshold of 75 per cent local backing in a referendum.

This will allow communities to bring forward the development they want, while still ensuring they are supported by the overwhelming majority of the local community.

### Conclusion

But the Community Right to Build is just one issue that has got people talking.

Indeed I suspect there will be a whole range of things you want to raise with me now.

I am pleased that you've got Iain Duncan-Smith along tomorrow to talk about welfare reform and helping people into work.

I suspect that Housing Benefit reform is something you will want to discuss with me too.

I know many of you are anxious to join the debate about security of tenure.

Some of you will have questions about how the New Homes Bonus will work.

Or maybe you want to discuss our plans to give every single social tenant the right to move.

But what I most want to discuss with you is how we can work together to get both our houses in order… so that we may build more homes and provide a truly five star service for present and future tenants.

So what can I do to help you achieve more with less of the public's money?

That's a starter question for you. Now it's your turn.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2115446,National Planning Policy Framework,"* * *

Mr Speaker I would like to make a statement about planning policy.

I am delighted today to be publishing the National Planning Policy Framework and our response to the Communities and Local Government Select Committee Report of the 21 December 2011.

Our reforms to planning policy have 3 fundamental objectives:

  * To put unprecedented power in the hands of communities to shape the places in which they live;
  * To better support growth to give the next generation the chance that our generation has had to have a decent home, and to allow the jobs to be created on which our prosperity depends; and
  * To ensure that the places we cherish - our countryside, towns and cities - are bequeathed to the next generation in a better condition than they are now.

To achieve these objectives reform is sorely needed.

A decade of Regional Spatial Strategies, top-down targets and national planning policy guidance that has swelled beyond reason to over 1000 pages across 44 documents, has led to communities seeing planning as something done to them, rather than _by_ them.

And as the planning system has become more complex, it has ground ever slower. In 2004 Parliament required every council to have a plan - eight years on, only around a half have been able to adopt one.

During the last decade - starting long before the financial crisis - we built fewer homes than in any peacetime decade for 100 years.

The average age of the first-time buyer is approaching 40, and rising rents mean that families have to spend more and more on housing, and less and less on themselves and their children.

We can't allow this to go on. To do so would be to deny our responsibility to young families - to tell them that the property-owning democracy was for our generation but not for yours.

Not all of this is down to sclerosis in the planning system, but some is. The Chambers of Commerce have said that the planning system has become;

> ""too complicated, too costly, too uncertain. It discourages investment, creates mistrust and holds back our recovery.""

And it's not as if what has made it through has made up in quality what it lacks in quantity.

Too much development in recent years has been mediocre, insensitive and has detracted from the character of the areas in which we live and work.

Too many of our habitats have been degraded and nature driven out.

The effect has been that much of the public have come to assume that any particular change to our built environment will be negative - that it will tend to impair beauty, damage the environment and make our lives worse.

What a disastrous state of affairs in a country which is home to some of the most talented designers, and the best architects and craftsmen in the world, and which has over the years constructed villages and cities and buildings - like the one we meet in - that people cross the world to see.

Our reforms to the planning system take on each of these challenges:

  * They enshrine the local plan - produced by local people - as the keystone of the planning system;
  * They make planning much simpler and more accessible, reducing over a thousand pages of often impenetrable jargon into around 50 pages of clearly written guidance;
  * They establish a presumption in favour of sustainable development that means that development is not held up unless to approve it would be against our collective interest;
  * The Framework guarantees robust protections for our natural and historic environment, and goes further by requiring net improvements to put right some of the neglect that has been visited on us;
  * It raises the bar on design standards so that we have the most exacting requirement for design that the English planning system has ever contained.

Mr Speaker, I have always regarded reforming the planning system as a serious responsibility.

From the start I made it clear that Parliament should be central to the development of the policy, we have had three full debates in this House and in the House of Lords - and I asked the Communities and Local Government Select Committee to consider the draft National Planning Policy Framework and to give me its considered advice.

I put on record my thanks to the chairman and members of that Committee and to Environmental Audit Committee for the seriousness and thoughtfulness that they brought to the task.

I am pleased to tell colleagues that of the Committee's 35 recommendations, I have been able to accept 30 in whole or in part.

In particular the final framework:

  * Makes it clear that the local plan is, as the Committee put it, the keystone of the planning edifice
  * Is crystal clear that sustainable development embraces social and environmental as well as economic objectives and does so in a balanced way;
  * Refers explicitly to the five principles of the UK Sustainable Development Strategy;
  * Goes further than ever before and is clear that councils should look for net improvements on all dimensions of sustainability;
  * Makes explicit that the presumption in favour of sustainable development works through, not against, local plans;
  * Makes it clear that relevant policies - such as those protecting the Green Belt, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, National Parks and other areas - cannot be overridden by the presumption;
  * Recognises the intrinsic value and beauty of the countryside (whether specifically designated or not);
  * Makes explicit what was always implicit: that councils' policies must encourage brownfield sites to be brought back into use;
  * Underlines the importance of town centres, while recognising that businesses in rural communities should be free to expand;
  * Takes a localist approach to creating a buffer of housing supply over and above 5 years, and in the use of windfall sites;
  * Allows councils to protect back gardens - those precious urban oases
  * Ensures that playing fields continue to benefit from that same protection that they do currently;

The final framework has been strengthened by the contributions of everyone who has taken the trouble to submit their views and I am very grateful for them.

It has always been my intention that councils who have done the right thing and either adopted, or have made good progress towards adopting local plans, will not be disadvantaged by the change to new policy.

Accordingly, I have introduced transitional arrangements suggested by, and agreed with, the Local Government Association. They accord weight to plans according to how advanced they are. However, I have gone further in two respects. I have allowed 12 months from today for existing plans to be adjusted to be in complete conformity with the new framework, and made clear that weight can be given to emerging plans.

Finally, Mr Speaker, this House has a particular role to play in safeguarding the interests of our successors. Having shaped the development of the new framework, I will ensure that Parliament supervises the implementation of the policies starting with a debate on the floor of the House soon after we return.

Mr Speaker, the purpose of planning is to help make the way we live our lives tomorrow better than it is today.

This National Planning Policy Framework will help build the homes the next generation needs.

It supports growth to allow employers to create the jobs our constituents need.

It protects what we hold dear in our matchless countryside and in the fabric of our history.

It does so by taking power away from remote bodies and putting it firmly into the hands of the people of England.

I warmly commend it to the House.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

### Introduction

Having recently been through an election I would have thought a lot of you would be fed up with listening to politicians.

Instead I think I should be listening to you.

So, I am only going to take about ten minutes of your time and then I'd like to take this opportunity to hear what this audience of experts has to say.

I am sorry I missed the session before lunch - I would have liked to have heard the combined wisdom of Nick Raynsford, Pam Alexander and Lord Heseltine.

I am sure it was entertaining.

And I am sure there are lots of lessons to learn.

There certainly need to be.

Because despite the previous Government's stated aim of tackling poverty, sometimes that wasn't the obvious outcome.

  * Today poverty has become increasingly concentrated in urban areas.
  * People are finding it increasingly difficult to escape the poverty trap.
  * And 50 per cent of those in social housing don't have a job further entrenching poverty.

### Commitment to regeneration

These poverty hot spots lead to over-stretched public services, higher levels of crime, and poor education and health outcomes for too many people.

If regeneration was invented for anything, it was to help these communities.

Yet many of same neighbourhoods that struggle today were struggling 30 years ago.

We cannot allow this to continue.

Frankly, we can't afford for it to continue.

The five Olympic boroughs have pledged that within 20 years, the communities who host the 2012 Games will have the same social and economic chances as their neighbours.

Not all deprived communities have an opportunity of the scale of the Olympics. But they all have opportunity. It's embedded in their untapped potential.

We need every part of Britain to play its role in turning around our economy. To seize opportunities: to fulfil their potential so as a nation we can fulfil ours.

As the Prime Minister said, 'All of us, across Britain, sharing in our prosperity.'

The Coalition Government has pledged to tackle the causes of poverty and inequality.

To protect the most vulnerable in society.

Let me be clear - the Coalition Government is absolutely committed to regeneration.

But we have to take a different approach if we're going to get a different result.

### Localism and Big Society

The mistaken belief that if something is broken, only the Government can fix it, is just plain wrong.

It's wrong for two reasons:

It doesn't work and …

It wastes money

The deprived communities in Lancashire I've visited several times, experience very different challenges to those of the poorest London boroughs.

And those challenges are best understood locally.

And the same applies when you look at Liverpool and Manchester. Sheffield and Leeds. You will know how people are proud of their differences and that is because they are different.

One size does not fit all.

People know best about how to change where they live.

Yes times are hard. Yes we need to cut the deficit.

But we won't walk away from places where the market has simply failed. The people who lives are affected know things have to change in their area.

But we will make sure that people have a real say in making the necessary changes.

And sometimes demolition may be the answer - especially if a house has no foundations!

Sometimes the answer will be retrofitting.

Sometimes it will be flats. Sometimes it will be new business areas.

Local people know best.

For too long too much regeneration has been done TO local people, rather than BY local people.

And that is why we are devolving power to neighbourhoods and street level to develop the right plans to drive their areas forward.

The Government is committed to this unprecedented and fundamental devolution of power.

That is why we will ensure that Government and Councillors are held to account by communities for how their money is spent. The power of democracy will ensure that millions of pounds of public cash is spent more wisely and more openly.

We are scrapping regional planning, allowing communities and local councils much greater control and power over their own destiny.

And we are removing the regional tier of Government and abolishing the Regional Development Agencies.

Regional Spatial Strategies.

And top-down housing targets.

Instead, through Local Enterprise Partnerships, we are placing responsibility for economic development with the people who really understand the challenges and opportunities their area faces.

So they can chart their own economic future.

These reforms together with a new general power of competence for local authorities will make it easier for local councils to lead the regeneration their communities desire.

### Community

But it's not just about central Government stepping back into the shadows.

We have to create the right conditions to enable local communities to step forward into the limelight.

To enable communities to take the lead we have to give them the right incentives, tools and information.

The Community Organisers and Community First programmes will encourage more social and community action, encouraging people to work together to improve their quality of life.

### Regional Regional Growth Fund

Despite the need to address the deficit, this Government recognises that we will need to support the most vulnerable places through this transition.

That is why we have set up the new £1 billion Regional Growth Fund.

It will play a central role in rebalancing the economy in those regions most reliant on public sector spending, by increasing private sector employment and growth.

### Conclusion

Regeneration can help us make the best of our assets and our people.

It can help areas adapt to new roles, and improve the distribution of wealth and opportunity.

It can restore social justice, and reduce community tensions.

And as the country adapts to a smaller state, regeneration can play a vital role for communities, by fostering a sense of solidarity and hope.

Lord Heseltine will confirm that the most important thing is getting people working together to tackle problems for themselves. I agree.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

Good morning and thank you to Jenny (Edwards - CEO of Homeless Link) for that kind introduction.

What a fabulous venue. Arlington House has achieved iconic status in the world of homelessness.

At one time the biggest hostel in Europe it has been mentioned by George Orwell, Alan Bennett and Madness. I'm in good if varied company.

Just look at it today. Transformed. Part of the pathway for Camden to help get rough sleepers off the streets, into training and jobs and onto independent living.

I am on record as saying that my proudest achievement so far was setting up the Conservative Homelessness Foundation.

But I want to trump that now I am Minister for Housing.

I want to end rough sleeping and I think, with your help, it is possible.

Surely the mark of a civilised society cannot be having people living on our streets.

I know that many of you have been fighting to right this wrong for far longer than me.

I know that most of you are from local authorities and you have all done an incredible job tackling statutory homelessness.

Quite frankly you have achieved far more than me.

And now I want to give you more power to use that experience, commitment and good sense to finally help everybody off the streets.

### Rough Sleeper Count

But first we need to know how many people are actually sleeping rough. One of the first things I did as Minister for Housing was call for a review of the way we count rough sleepers.

Like me, I know that many of you have been frustrated that previous rough sleeping figures did not tell the whole story.

Actually as it turned out it didn't even tell half the story.

No one seriously believed that we had only 440 rough sleepers on the streets of England.

So I acted quickly and made sure we got a clearer national picture. The snapshot figure is not 440, but 1247.

In future counts will be more accurate and estimates as real as possible.

Each individual has a reason to sleep rough.

Most of the time these reasons are complex.

For some the path may start with a breakdown in a relationship, losing a job, abuse of alcohol or drugs.

For some it's mental health issues.

For some it's a terrible mixture of all of these and more.

And we still see too many ex-offenders in the latest figures and migrants from Eastern Europe sleeping rough.

Yes, outreach teams are doing a fantastic job bringing people in off the streets, but the number of people flowing on to the streets remains too high.

### Cross Government Working Group

We need to make sure that Government policy, whether it be helping people to find a job, claim benefits or come out of the army or prison, is coordinated.

And we must act to remove bureaucratic burdens wherever they are identified.

That is why I have set up the new Government has set up a cross-Government Ministerial Working Group on homelessness.

Eight departments' Ministers are on this Working Group.

Last week the Group heard from Jenny Edwards, Leslie Morphy of Crisis and from Ric Blakeway, who chairs the Mayor's London delivery Board on rough sleeping.

It is really important that Ministers hear about the problems that homeless people face. You and I know this stuff but for many of my colleagues it's a real eye-opener.

I want them to know how important it is that people at risk of rough sleeping get the help they need before it's too late.

## Ex-offenders

For me it was an important priority to focus colleagues' attention on the needs of people leaving prison.

As I identified in the report I wrote in opposition, 'Prison Break', too many prisoners are released with nowhere to go.

32 per cent of those sleeping rough last year had spent time in prison.

Stable accommodation reduces re-offending and so called 'bed and breakfast crime' where ex-prisoners re-offend simply to get a roof over their heads.

It is clear that the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Ministry Of Justice need to work together to address this, so I've discussed this with Crispin Blunt, Minister for Prisons.

As a result I'm working with Crisis on a project to help more people at risk of homelessness - including prisoners on release - find a room in the private rented sector.

We have also agreed action to ensure prisoners receive appropriate housing advice to prevent homelessness.

These are significant steps forward and will help more people move out of prison into a home rather than on to the streets.

And I am pleased to be able to report this real and practical outcome of setting up the ministerial working group.

### Conclusion

We will need all the practical good sense outcomes we can muster for the challenging times ahead.

Tomorrow the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review will be made public - and I am able to exclusively reveal the outcome today.

Yes, it's going to be tough - really tough.

Yes, we will all have to do a lot more with less.

Central government will increasingly focus on what only it can do: removing bureaucracy and making sure national policies across Whitehall join up - like the support we will offer to people leaving prison.

We have to make sure we count fewer people who are forced to sleep rough the night they are released from prison.

Yes, we must help the people we count sleeping rough tonight, off the street tomorrow.

We must also make sure we don't have to count them again in two weeks time.

Well, actually - as we all know the best thing to do is never have to count them in the first place - to keep them off the streets.

Because, to be honest, counting is not enough.

It[s only a means to an end.

The end of rough sleeping.

That's a big aspiration but one I reckon we can achieve together.

Thank you.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"Arlington House, Camden, London",,,,19-Oct-2010,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,providing-housing-support-for-older-and-vulnerable-people,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

### Faith and social action: a long tradition

Standing here, you can almost hear the echoes.

Five minutes across the road is Oxford House.

One hundred and twenty years ago, it was home to young men preparing for the clergy.

They would come to see life in what was then one of the toughest parts of the capital.

They would help working families: educate the young, and care for the old; confront the misery caused by poverty and alcohol.

It was more than a preparation for the ministry.

It was an expression of their sense of responsibility for their fellow man - their duty to be what Matthew calls ""the salt of the earth and the light of the world.""

In the hundred years since, the communities who live round here have changed immeasurably.

At the end of the nineteenth century Jewish communities made the East End their home, to be replaced more recently by new arrivals from Bangladesh.

The building at 59 Brick Lane stands as a monument to these changes.

First a church, then a synagogue, it is now the Brick Lane Mosque.

But I say I can hear the echoes, because the work we are celebrating today is the next chapter in the same centuries-old and proud and unbroken tradition of people of faith giving back to local communities.

Enriching their neighbourhood.

Improving the lives of those around them through practical action.

Historians look at Oxford House and Toynbee House and the rest and talk about ""class consciousness"" and ""social engagement"", but for me it is really all about something very human: compassion.

That value of compassion is at the heart of every faith.

I have never come across a temple, mosque, synagogue, gurdwara or any other place of worship that looked wholly within: that did not care about the welfare of every one of its neighbours, no matter if they had a different faith, or none.

### Making sure it's easy for faith groups to play their part.

So what this Government wants to do, what I want to do, is to recognise the vital role that faith groups play in local communities.

Not to muscle in. Not to replicate.

But to give you room to do what you do best.

There's that old British problem.

Volunteers come ready to give something back and we take that care and commitment and squeeze it right out of you.

We put you on a committee.

We make you an expert - in paperwork.

Of course we need regulation to protect the vulnerable.

To make sure everyone is treated fairly.

But if too much bureaucracy means that volunteers decide the game isn't worth the candle, then it's utterly self-defeating.

So we want to make it easy.

Protect people, but without getting in the way.

Regulation has to be proportionate.

These are the principles behind such reforms as the changes we're making to the criminal checks system.

At the same time, we want public bodies of all kinds to have the confidence to work with you.

Most councils get it.

They provide grants or contract faith-inspired groups to provide services.

And those faith groups do the job well, and professionally, without proselytising.

In other places, I've heard that councils are more tentative.

In some places there's an idea that faith makes you a bit ""weird.""

But where you are the people who have the best contacts, the best reach into different communities, it's a tragedy if we miss out on your potential.

This was in my mind when we revised what's called our ""best value"" guidance.

That guidance says that councils must work with local community groups and charities as a matter of course - and that naturally includes faith-based ones.

I'm particularly proud about the length of the revised guidance.

It's long… a whole page long.

No-one can hide in the small print.

Plain and simple, there's no excuse for councils not talking to you.

### Near Neighbours

Now today, this Government is determined to reduce the deficit, because it's the only responsible thing to do.

Budgets might be tight; They would be a darn sight tighter in the future if we didn't act now.

In getting public spending under control, we have sought to protect funding for the most vulnerable, such as the ""Supporting People"" programme.

We have changed the way grants are paid to local councils so that those places who rely most on central grants are cushioned most.

And we see the value of the work that faith groups do - and recognise that a little support now can make a big difference not just in this financial year, but for many years to come.

So I see the five million pounds we are putting in the ""Near Neighbours"" programme over the next three years as an investment in the future. 

That fund has three vital jobs to do.

It's going to provide grants of up to five thousand pounds to grass roots groups.

Already the fund is supporting projects in Birmingham and Bradford, Leicester and Newham - from parenting classes to healthy eating.

These projects bring people of different faiths and backgrounds together. Helping them get to know each other.

In fact, when different communities live side by side, faith - far from being the cause of division - can be what bridges the gaps.

And I love that the grants are run through a nimble system.

The form is designed to be simple and administrators try to turn applications around in two weeks or less.

In some cases they've been doing it in less than one.

Cracking stuff.

The fund is going to support links between clergy of different faiths - covering the basic cost of imams and vicars meeting, talking, and sharing their experiences.

This is going to help faith leaders new to the role to get to grips with the very practical side of ministry, from bookkeeping, to child protection laws.

And the fund will help support a new generation of leaders and young activists.

The people who want to make a difference in their community through practical help - get graffiti cleaned up, gardens planted, and tasks done as humble but necessary and full of compassion as helping old folk do the weekly shop.

These young people deserve attention and support - and I hope that the Near Neighbours fund will at least go some way towards giving them that.

### Conclusion

Finally, let me say thank you to the Church Urban Fund, the Christian Muslim Forum, the board who are providing oversight for the programme, and all the other organisations and individuals who have helped us get this far.

Our local communities are stronger - and as a nation we are stronger - when faith groups feel able and confident not only to speak about, but to take action about, the challenges society faces.

With your help, faith groups can grasp that role with new confidence and new energy.

I look forward to it, and wish you the very best in your efforts.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,London,,,,14-Nov-2011,bringing-people-together-in-strong-united-communities,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/articles/newsroom/neighbourhoodplanning,Neighbourhood planning is an opportunity for councillors,"* * *

As readers of the MJ will well know, this country's planning system has grown increasingly acrimonious in recent years. Centralised decision-making has pitched developers against communities, councils against residents. Elected members, much like planning officers, have been caught in the crossfire, hemmed in on the one side by regional strategies and top down housing targets, and, on the other, by local communities who feel put upon and alienated from the process.

Through the Localism Bill, the Government is proposing profound reform. Perhaps the single most radical proposal is neighbourhood planning. In the future, instead of being told what will happen to the cities, towns and villages they love, local communities themselves will have new opportunities to shape local development. They will be able to define, together, where new homes and businesses should go, and what they should look like.

Far from holding up much-needed development, neighbourhood planning will help unlock it. When communities have the chance to shape plans themselves, and to feel the benefits of local growth - through the new homes bonus, community infrastructure levy, and (in the longer term) an end to the instant spiriting away of business rates to Whitehall - they will have real reasons to welcome development, rather than resist it.

Although the formal provisions of neighbourhood planning will not kick in until after the Bill has received Royal Assent, communities and councils are already keen to get on with showing just how putting power in the hands of local people can work. To date, 90 different communities are trialling neighbourhood planning, in a mix of cities, urban and rural areas.

Places such as Breckland, Gateshead and Torbay are receiving £20,000 of support from government each. We have a total of £5m of support available, and will be inviting a further round of bids very soon. The more places take part, and the greater the diversity of different areas, the more lessons there will be to draw when the formal legal provisions take effect.

The introduction of neighbourhood planning spells big changes for elected members. Some felt the original drafting of the Localism Bill might exclude them from the process. That was not my intention - quite the contrary - and at report stage we brought forward amendments, ensuring that councillors can play their legitimate and important role in the debate about their neighbourhood's future.

This is an opportunity for councillors to get out of the crossfire and approach planning in a much more positive way: to work closely with local communities, helping them articulate their ambitions for the place where they live, and making sure that the powers-that-be deliver the result that they want. This is, after all, what the job is all about. So I very much hope that elected members and planning officers will match communities' enthusiasm, and embrace a better way of doing planning.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2041969,New Homes Bonus: December 2011,"* * *

Today, I am pleased to announce the delivery of 159,000 more homes over the last year, and £431 million of government funding to local authorities.

The New Homes Bonus is a powerful, simple and transparent incentive for housing growth. It is a key part of the housing growth focus of our national housing strategy, which we published on 21 November 2011. Commenced in April 2011, the Bonus is based on the council tax of additional homes and those brought back into use, with an additional amount for affordable homes, for the following six years. It ensures that those local authorities which promote and welcome growth can share in its economic benefits, and build the communities in which people want to live and work.

The Bonus will be paid in respect of 159,000 homes from October 2010 to October 2011 including 137,000 extra homes and 22,000 long-term empty properties brought back into use. The allocations also include the first affordable homes enhancement, which totals £21 million in respect of 61,000 new affordable homes.

This means we will pay councils £431 million of provisional New Homes Bonus for local authorities in England. This includes the second instalment of £199 million in respect of year 1 and £232 million for housing growth in year 2.

We are committed to ensuring that the Bonus remains a flexible, non-ringfenced fund, for local communities to spend as they see fit - from reinvesting it in housing or infrastructure, support local services or local facilities, or using the funds to keep council tax down. Local authorities are best placed to understand the barriers to growth in their areas, the needs of their local communities and lead a mature debate about the benefits that growth can bring. There are already good examples of local authorities using the Bonus in a variety of ways. For example Wychavon are returning up to 40% to the community where growth is taking place. Liverpool are reinvesting in a commitment to deliver 2,000 new homes. The Vale of White Horse are investing in business growth by making the car parks free in the three local market towns of Abingdon, Wantage and Faringdon.

The New Homes Bonus is a key part of our ambition, set out in the Local Growth White Paper, to create a fairer and more balanced economy through encouraging growth. It will sit alongside the Government's proposals to allow local authorities to benefit from economic growth by the local retention of business rates. Our reformed Community Infrastructure Levy allows local authorities to ensure development contributes to the infrastructure needed to support growth and will give people a real say in spending to deal with the impacts of growth on their neighbourhoods.

On top of these provisional allocations, we will address any loss of New Homes Bonus in areas affected by last summer's riots through riot recovery funds  
Local authorities will have until 30 December 2011 to make representations on their provisional allocations. The Department has written to local authorities with details for making representations on their authority's provisional allocations and I have also written to all Members of Parliament in England.

A full list of the provisional allocations is being placed in the Library of the House.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/newhomesbonus,New Homes Bonus: 17 February 2011,"* * *

Today, I am announcing the final design of the New Homes Bonus. The New Homes Bonus will fulfil the Government's Coalition Agreement commitment to provide local authorities with real incentives to deliver housing growth.

This is a key part of our ambition, set out in the Local Growth white paper, to create a fairer and more balanced economy through encouraging growth. The role of local areas in this rebalancing of growth is crucial - localities are best placed to understand drivers and barriers to local growth and should lead their own development to release their economic potential. In so doing they should be able to benefit directly from the development they bring forward.

On the 12 November I wrote to English MPs and local authority leaders announcing a consultation on implementation of this commitment through the proposals for the New Homes Bonus. The consultation closed on 24 December. We received some 470 responses from local authorities, representative groups, MPs and individuals. The responses gave widespread support to the principles of the scheme and the broad scheme design. After considering all responses I am announcing the final scheme design and implementation.

The New Homes Bonus is designed to address the disincentive within the local government finance system for local areas to welcome growth. Until now, increased housing in communities has meant increased strain on public services and reduced amenities. The New Homes Bonus will remove this disincentive by providing local authorities with the means to mitigate the strain the increased population causes. In addition, in doing so the New Homes Bonus should help engender a more positive attitude to growth, and create an environment in which new housing is more readily accepted.

The New Homes Bonus scheme will be a powerful, simple and transparent incentive. Commencing in April 2011, the Bonus will match fund the additional council tax potential from increases in effective housing stock, with an additional amount for affordable homes, for the following 6 years. It will ensure that the economic benefits of housing growth are more visible to the local authorities and communities where growth takes place.

But Housing growth is not just about new units. It is also about best use of existing stock. For this reason, we have designed New Homes Bonus to measure increases in effective stock - the change in total number of homes and change in empty homes. Empty homes contribute to blight, are a local eyesore and can be a source of local opposition to new homes. But they can also play an important role in increasing available housing - data suggests the average number of long term privately owned empty homes over the past five years is around 300,000. Of these between 100,000 and 130,000 are in areas of strong housing demand.

The balance between market and affordable homes is crucial - therefore the Bonus will provide an additional £350 for each affordable home for the following six years. This means that the bonus available for an affordable home will be up to 36 per cent more than for a similar market home.

The New Homes Bonus will be unring-fenced. This flexible funding will allow the benefits of housing growth to be returned to those communities affected by growth in a way which best meets local need. Local authorities will need to lead the debate with their communities to determine local spending priorities.

The Department for Communities and Local Government has set aside almost £1bn over the Spending Review period for the scheme, including some £200m in 2011-12 or year 1. From year 2, funding beyond these levels will come from Formula Grant.

These radical reforms, demonstrate our commitment to seeing a major upswing in housing to meet Britain's housing need and seeing more homes that people want in the places that people want them. We also want to see greater housing market stability, where house price rises are more in line with earnings growth. However, we will not impose this through top down targets which attempt to dictate where growth happens, but too often produce little but hostility.

They will be complemented by reforms to the Community Infrastructure Levy, which will incentivise growth by providing authorities with a powerful new tool to secure contributions from development to deliver the infrastructure that communities need to make that growth acceptable and sustainable. The Local Government Resource Review will consider how business growth can be incentivised. This framework will encourage local authorities and communities to increase their ambitions for housing and economic growth, and to take the lead in managing the way in which villages, towns and cities develop.

The New Homes Bonus also sits alongside the existing framework for making planning decisions. Responsibility will remain with local authorities to work within this framework to continue to ensure that development is suitable and sustainable by meeting local needs and national planning policy.

Today, I am announcing the final allocations for local authorities in England for the New Homes Bonus Year 1 funding. This announcement follows my written statement of 17 February about the final design of the New Homes Bonus. The New Homes Bonus will fulfil the Government's Coalition Agreement commitment to provide local authorities with real incentives to deliver housing growth.

Local authorities had until 10 March to make data representations on their provisional grant allocations. We received 27 representations of which 16 were revisions to the 2009 and 2010 Council Tax Base statistics, three were banding corrections between 2009 and 2010 and eight were about other matters. The 2010 Council Tax Base statistics were released as official statistics on 31 March and we have used the official statistics to calculate the final allocations. We have worked closely with authorities to resolve other data issues.

New Homes Bonus is a key part of our ambition, set out in the Local Growth White Paper, to create a fairer and more balanced economy through encouraging growth. The role of local areas in this rebalancing of growth is crucial - they are best placed to understand the drivers of, and barriers to, local growth and should lead their own development to release their economic potential.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

No Second Night Out - that's some ambition.

But if Boris promises it can be done in London why shouldn't we achieve it across the country.

London has the biggest numbers of rough sleepers.

So if he can make no second night out apply there then surely we can make it apply everywhere.

When I say ""we"" I really mean you.

You are the ones who will do the hard work.

People who have chosen to care about people who don't have a home.

Homeless Link brings together people who care and whatever you call it - the voluntary sector, the first sector or the charity sector - I think you are an important expression of the Big Society.

You don't walk by on the other side of the street.

Instead you devote your lives to helping people off the streets.

You have a track record to be proud of but you also know there is more to do.

The only problem was that we didn't really know what the scale of the problem really was.

The Rough Sleeping Count was more of a Rough Sleeping Rough Guess.

That's why I was prepared to take the bad publicity for rising numbers of rough sleepers by fixing the false stats - the new numbers merely reflected a reality.

Now the Rough Sleeping Count really does count.

We have a better idea of the scale of the problem.

And because we know that every individual we count is homeless for different reasons we set up the Ministerial Working Group on Homelessness.

For the first time Ministers get round the table and work out how to deal with homelessness.

Whether its substance abuse, mental illness, or leaving prison (or a chaotic mix) that puts people on the street I can talk to colleagues from across Government to help.

The Ministerial Working Group has heard from a range of experts, including Jenny, and we listened carefully.

The No Second Night Out pledge came out of our discussions.

That was the first commitment made in the plan published by the Ministerial Working Group on Homelessness.

Of course many cities already have excellent homelessness services in place, and have been highly successful at reducing levels of rough sleeping.

Local authorities will need to build on these to adopt a gold standard approach to rough sleeping services that meet the No Second Night Out principles.

We all know there is more to do.

Anyone can make a pledge but we now need to work together to achieve it.

That's why we have maintained Homelessness Grant at this year's level, investing £400m over the next four years.

In addition we are providing £20m administered by Homeless Link to the voluntary sector. This new funding will be available to help deliver NSNO.

I'm also able to announce today that I have secured an additional £5m for the Homelessness Change Programme resulting in total funding of £42.5m.

Under the Homelessness Change Programme the HCA has agreed 37 projects across the country that will get funding to help improve hostels for rough sleepers.

There are a variety of projects and providers and I am confident that the new programme is going to make a difference to those who have been homeless with nearly 1,200 bedspaces resulting from the investment we're announcing today.

Just to give you a few examples:

  * St Mungo's are providing move-on accommodation for long term rough sleepers currently in the City of London
  * Cheltenham YMCA have an impressive scheme to help young homeless people with a new 73 bed facility spread across several properties across their Vittoria Road site
  * In North Lincolnshire, Framework will develop a 20 bed facility with onsite training in an area of unmet need.

You may know I am not a big fan of targets.

I have said again and again that the house building targets of the previous Government meant that houses didn't get built.

But I don't see No Second Night Out as a target.

I see it as an obligation.

It is obscene that a society as advanced as ours cannot stop people sleeping on our streets for two nights in a row.

Over the years I have visited many hostels, and shelters - I expect some of my hosts are in the audience.

What I remember is the ex homeless people I met.

People like Michael Dolan (No Second Night Out London service user speaking at conference) who wanted to tell me their story.

How they had ended up on the street but also how they had now turned their life around.

The thing I remember most is the pride they took in having done it themselves.

Yes they needed your help but in the end they are the ones who helped themselves.

They decided they had had enough of their chaotic lives and wanted to change them for the better.

And more impressively many now wanted to help others turn their lives around.

To help them take their first step off the streets.

They know how dangerous and damaging life on the street is.

I listened to them and worked hard to make sure that the Government is committed to No Second Night Out.

I look forward to working with you to achieving that.

No Second Night Out for anyone. It can be done.

And remember No Second Night Out was only one of six commitments made in the first Ministerial Working Group report.

We'll push through all the elements of the 'No Second Night Out' report.

A lot of people and organisations write reports about homelessness, complete with recommendations, but the difference is that this Government will provide the leadership to deliver the recommendations in our report.

The next Ministerial Working Group report on Homelessness will focus what leads to homelessness.

So now I look forward to our discussion about what more the Government can do to help homeless people out of shop doorways, off park benches, from out of the shadows and into permanent homes.

My colleague the Minister for Sport and the Olympics and I have today given our approval to the recommendation of the Olympic Park Legacy Company to select the joint bid from West Ham United Football Club and the London Borough of Newham as the preferred bidder for the legacy use of the Olympic Stadium. We are therefore writing to the Company informing them of our decisions as its joint Government Founder Members. The Mayor of London, as the other Founder Member of the Company, will also write separately.

This completes the first stage of this process and means that the Olympic Park Legacy Company are now able to enter into negotiations with the consortium comprising West Ham United Football Club and the London Borough of Newham to agree a lease for the Olympic Stadium site on terms that are acceptable to Government and the Mayor of London and provide value for money to the public sector. We are delighted with the progress that has been made and very pleased we have reached this very significant milestone in determining the long term legacy for the Olympic Park following the Games.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,,written-statement,3-Mar-2011,,,,,,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

I am particularly pleased to be able to address this conference today. I am also very grateful to CIPFA for taking the lead in arranging this event.

They have shown imagination and enthusiasm in advocating action on the management of publicly owned property and land.

And have played a supportive role in the joint programme my Department has undertaken with the 11 Pathfinders, across England to shape the public estate to release resources and improve service delivery.

We have been working with the 11 pathfinders to co-design an approach which uses knowledge of the requirements of the local community to make better use of existing public buildings, and land.

And by public bodies working co-operatively to make capital investment in public building projects.

It is this spirit of cooperation and shared purpose which is needed if full advantage of the opportunities that a new approach to asset management can bring, is to be achieved.

From the outset of the Asset management programme, I have been impressed by the energy and innovation of those who have taken part.

It has been clear that each pathfinder has seen the opportunities to be gained from local public bodies bringing together land and buildings.

The opportunities not only for releasing capital, but for improving services too. For too long those who need advice and help from our public bodies, have had to traipse round from one building to another to access them individually.

The benefit to them of being able to find all they need from housing to benefits, from health services to social services, from jobs, to police to the Inland Revenue, either all or in part, is significant.

Plenty of places are already grasping these opportunities. Herefordshire is a great example of this.

It expects to make £4.3 million savings a year (amounting to £33 million over 10 years) from the transformation of individual services to shared services between public service providers - the council, hospital trust and primary care trust (PCT).

And Hammersmith & Fulham, Kensington & Chelsea, and Westminster are collaborating to save £35 million by shining a spotlight on waste; sharing back offices; maximizing their assets; divesting services.

To give you a flavour of some of the stories you may hear later, from the Pathfinders themselves, Hull has worked with the private sector to deliver energy savings. Cambridgeshire has identified how it can use its assets to enable regeneration in a deprived area and Swindon has used assets for growth, including housing and retail development.

And Worcestershire which as well as making impressive savings has also come up with creative options for transferring multiple assets to community ownership and management which will save money and enhance services.

This all started, of course, with Hampshire, where Andrew Smith the chief Executive recognised the possibilities of Asset Management and has not only proslytised, but inspirationally led this whole policy.

The importance of this enterprise really cannot be over emphasised.

For now, I won't dwell on what we have done with Pathfinders over the past year or so. Their distinguished representatives are here to explain that and today's workshops will explore the details and, I hope, answer your specific questions.

We know that the public estate is worth in the region of £385billion with estimated running costs of £25billion a year. Around two thirds of this is owned by Local Authorities.

It is essential, therefore, not only because of the current economic stress, but for the future, that both centrally and locally we recognise the value locked up in these assets.

So where these are underused, it will be in everybody's interests that public bodies work together to release those resources, and redirect some of them to new uses, or jointly consider disposal options.

However, it has not all been plain sailing - one of the tasks of the pathfinders has been to identify barriers to all this ambition, one of my department's' has been to help knock down those barriers, such as the mismatch between various parts of Government on the use of capital receipts.

The value of my department's involvement in the programme has been the ability to bring Government representatives together with the pathfinders to identify and discuss the issues, and to help find a way through them.

We will remain ready to do this, as necessary in the future.

We think that a place based approach offers opportunities to make significant savings on running costs and to cut the maintenance backlog bill currently estimated to be £40billion across the public sector.

But there are more than just financial benefits: this new approach could make a real contribution to protecting and improving front line services.

It could provide opportunities to strengthen the sustainability of the voluntary and community sector.

It could enable the release of significant amounts of capital funds for reinvestment, in other programmes, and perhaps an increase in energy efficiency and the creation of green jobs.

It could assist the delivery of much needed housing and regeneration as well as encouraging growth.

The locally based approach is a chance to develop a real paradigm shift in the way local public services work - the real prize is service transformation.

I recognise that the pressures on local authorities and other public bodies are considerable. There is no escaping this in the current financial circumstances facing the country.

But the key here is for public bodies to have freedom to decide their approach whilst being hard headed on the outcomes they want to see.

This is as much about Whitehall changing and devolving responsibilities, as it is about councils, local public sector agencies, and communities doing things differently.

Whitehall must give them the freedom to be innovative and make the right choices on behalf of, and with their communities.

There is a clear link between the work that has, and still is being done on asset management and The Local Government Group's Place Based Productivity programme.

While The Local Productivity Programme goes much wider than asset management it aims to help local government identify and deliver short term savings to create the space to deliver longer-term transformational changes to services.

The programme has the potential to help with ideas and strategies to bridge the gap in funding, how to work more collaboratively and transform local public services. Capital and Assets management is seen as one of the 3 big wins of the programme.

We still face many challenges to achieving this ambition. As more areas grasp the new freedoms to take a comprehensive locally based approach, there will be many issues to work through.

But we share an ambition to make these approaches work, and to help local public bodies transform services.

If we can make this a benchmark for capital and asset use we will have improved efficiency, saved money and transformed services - this is a prize worth having.

I have very much enjoyed chairing the Pathfinder Programme. Over the coming months I will look forward to seeing the business plans and projects coming to fruition.

I will also take an active interest in seeing this spread more widely, becoming an integral part of the planning of local areas.

I would like to say how impressed I have been throughout my involvement in the programme with the invention and hard work of the pathfinders. Equally I have been pleased with how different their proposals have been, demonstrating the breadth of vision they have on these issues.

Local Government Improvement and Development - will now take over the lead in spreading the pan public sector approach to areas beyond the11 Pathfinders.

I am pleased that CIPFA will continue to play a leading role in this and help to embed the best practice.

I hope you have an interesting day, and that the ideas and enthusiasms which will be demonstrated to you, by the pathfinders,  
will stimulate public bodies across the country, to follow their lead.",baroness-hanham,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/baronesshanham,"Church House Conference Centre, Westminster, London.",,,,26-May-2011,giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development,,,,baroness-hanham,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The Growth Review has announced that the Government will act to remove barriers to more open and efficient local public services including guidance on workforce matters. I wish to provide the House with a detailed update on our approach, including plans to discuss with employers, employee representatives and others whether any alternative arrangements might be useful in the future.

I am revoking, with immediate effect, the guidance on workforce matters which formed part of the last administration's Best Value regime. This is the _Handling of workforce matters in contracting_ and the _Code of practice on workforce matters in local authority service contracts_ ('the two tier code') (Annexes C and D plus paragraphs 28 to 31 of _ODPM Circular 03/2003_) and corresponding guidance applicable to fire and rescue authorities and the Greater London Authority (_ODPM circulars 07/2003_ for the GLA and _09/2004_ for the Fire and Rescue Service).

Councils, the voluntary sector and businesses - especially small firms - have called on the Government to remove unnecessary burdens and barriers that act to prevent fair and open competition. Removing this guidance will help create a level playing field, ensure more opportunities for innovation, help ensure better value for taxpayers' money in the provision of public services, and remove red tape that hinders job creation.

The withdrawal of the two-tier code will not impact on existing TUPE regulations and provisions in the Employment Act 2008 or other employment legislation. There may be instances where contracts will be due for renewal or are currently out to tender and it will be a matter for local authorities to take legal advice on the particular contract specifications and circumstances. The abolition will not be applied retrospectively. Therefore existing contracts and the employment terms that flow from them will not be affected by withdrawal of the code.

I will be writing over the coming days to employers, employee representatives and others to invite their views on whether there might be anything, such as a statement of good employment principles in place of the Code, that would be helpful for the future.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,23-Mar-2011,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The Minister for Housing and Local Government (The Rt Hon Grant Shapps): I announced on 14 July 2010 that I intended to bring forward in Parliament secondary legislation that would transfer most of the functions of County Courts under the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to Residential Property Tribunals. The aim of the transfer of the jurisdiction is to provide residents of park homes and the owners with a level playing field in the resolution of disputes. This will be achieved by providing access to a dedicated, low cost specialist (housing) tribunal, which can deal with cases quickly and without the parties needing to be legally represented. The necessary Statutory Instrument was laid on 31 January and subject to it receiving approval of both Houses of Parliament will come into force on 30 April 2011.

I am also today announcing my intention to consult on a further package of measures that could improve and modernise the licensing regime that applies to caravan and park home sites to enable local authorities to more effectively monitor and enforce licences and, therefore, better protect the many thousands of older households who live in this sector. I intend to consult on giving local authorities powers to charge site owners for their licensing functions and services- instead of these being funded by the tax payer or not provided at all to a satisfactory standard because authorities do not have the resources to do so. I also intend to consult on enabling the courts to impose higher fines for the most serious breaches of licence conditions, and on giving authorities a more effective means of carrying out emergency safety-critical works at the owner's expense where the site owner has refused to do the work himself. I believe these reforms to site licensing will modernise the regime and make it more effective in delivering its objective of ensuring that sites are safe and properly managed.

I am also concerned about what appears to be abuse by some site owners of their role in approving the purchaser when a resident wishes to sell his park home in the open market. It seems clear that a small minority of site owners will routinely block sales for their own financial gain. I intend to consult on measures which would aim to eliminate this unacceptable practice and extend the role of the Residential Property Tribunal in the approval process.

I intend to carry out a public consultation on these proposals in the spring.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,,written-statement,10-Feb-2011,,,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,improving-the-rented-housing-sector,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/parkhomesreforms,Park homes reforms: July 2010,"* * *

The Minister for Housing and Local Government (The Rt Hon Grant Shapps): The Government values the role the park home sector plays in the housing market offering an affordable alternative to mainstream housing for many people, often over the age of fifty, in mainly rural, semi-rural and seaside locations. Although many residents appreciate and value the sense of community that park home living engenders, I am aware that many also experience difficulties in exercising their rights and achieving their aspirations. Furthermore, a minority of site owners continue to cause significant problems to residents and the local community in which they operate.

I am, therefore, today announcing that the Government intends, subject to Parliamentary consent, to transfer most of the functions of County Courts under the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to Residential Property Tribunals. The aim of the transfer of the jurisdiction is to provide residents of park homes and their site owners, with a level playing field in the resolution of disputes, by providing access to a dedicated, low cost specialist (housing) tribunal, which can deal with cases quickly and effectively, without the parties needing to be legally represented. This will mean that park home residents will be able to take action to resolve disputes with site owners, without being restricted by the prospect of facing large legal costs.

I propose to lay before Parliament the necessary secondary legislation to effect the transfer as soon as possible after summer recess, with a view to transferring jurisdiction to the Residential Property Tribunals by the end of the year.

I am also announcing my intention to work closely with interested resident and industry partners in developing potential measures for empowering residents to exercise more control over the management of sites, where there are management failings by site owners which significantly impact upon the well-being of the local communities.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,,written-statement,14-Jul-2010,,,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,improving-the-rented-housing-sector,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I'm pleased to be here today to set out some of the next steps in Government's proposals for putting communities in control of their own destiny through the planning system; and delighted to be able to say more about how the forthcoming Localism Bill will change planning for the better.

But let me start by talking about the wider context.

Planning isn't a job - it's a vocation. All of us hope we leave a legacy in our professional life. Planners certainly do leave a legacy. They shape the workplaces where we spend thousands of hours each year; the homes we go home to the evening, and the schools where our children learn. At its best, their work is much more than functional. It inspires and elates.

So my starting point as planning Minister is that planners have an awesomely important job to do. I take very seriously my responsibility of enabling them to do that job to the very highest standards.

But I agree with the TCPA that at present the planning system is not doing its job ""as well as it should.""

The current framework is bureaucratic. Last year, local authorities spent 13 per cent more in real terms on planning than they did five years ago - despite a 32 per cent drop in the number of applications received.

It is too centralised: regional spatial strategies imposed housing targets which made people feel put upon.

And it is ineffective. The levels of housebuilding last year were the lowest in peacetime since 1924. Evidence suggests that commercial development is suffering, and businesses say that the planning system is a barrier to growth.

This government has ambitious proposals to make the system fit to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Above all, we want to change the philosophy behind local planning. We want to move away from a system with significant elements of imposition from above, to one with participation and involvement at its heart - not just warm words, or a commitment in principle, but real opportunities for people to have a say. And away from a system that seeks to resolve the different needs of different groups at a local level by imposing choices from above, towards one which enables a mature debate at local level.

I'm delighted to have the chance to talk about these issues at the TCPA - for two reasons. One, your manifesto recognises in its very first clause the need for a planning system... ""based on widespread community engagement."" You have been a consistent champion of that principle, and a powerhouse of expertise on how it's done in practice. Two - TCPA's great strength is that it brings together all the different interests in planning - community groups, developers, businesses and more. It represents, at a national scale, the kind of coming together that we want to help happen in local discussions about planning.

The Big Society means putting real power in the hands of local people. It is based on the idea that in very many areas of life people can make the best decisions about what's best for themselves, for their family, for the place where they live. I think that people should be able to make real choices about planning - much as they should be able to make choices in relation to healthcare or education - as a matter of principle.

But evidence also suggests that restoring power to a very local level may have the practical effect of helping people feel positive about development. Imposition alienates. As any parent can tell you, telling someone to do something - even when you're absolutely convinced that it's in their best interests - doesn't always work.

IPSOS Mori research from this summer says too many people feel locked out and ""done to"" by the planning system. A typical comment from the research said: ""I feel powerless - what can we do?"" It's simpler to say ""no"" than to engage with a system that doesn't seem to listen to you. The reaction to the old regional spatial strategies seemed to bear this out. The South West regional strategy alone attracted 35,000 written objections.

Conversely, proper discussion with local people encourages a sense of ownership about development. Experience suggests that developers of major projects have a better chance of securing consent if they carry out consultation with local communities before they make a planning application. And the TCPA's own guide to community planning obligations gives a wealth of evidence about how involvement lets people see the benefits of development, and helps them be prepared to say ""yes.""

Take the story of Ascott-Under-Wychwood in Oxfordshire. The local shop closed in 1998. When, in 2002, local people found out about plans to convert a farm, they saw their chance to get a village shop back again. In exchange for the developer gifting a shop to the community, they said they would put up no objection to the developer's plans. They were supportive, because they could see what was in for them. The shop is still going strong.

Or take what's happening with Burgess Hill Town Council in Sussex - who have begun a conversation with local people about the possibility of new housing - making the case that the extra investment that it would make possible could help pay for road improvements, a sports centre, new civic amenities, upgrades to the local station or a new business park.

Our proposals are designed to enable this kind of mature debate about local planning everywhere. Because the problem is, although participation has been recognised as an essential element of good planning since the Skeffington Report in 1969, and although there are some examples of developers and planners getting it very right indeed, there are too many instances of participation being a an unimaginative add-on to the planning process.

We want to embed participation in the way the system works. Instead of having decision-makers consult local communities, we want to enable local people to make more decisions themselves. We want to hand over power and responsibility so that local communities have real choices, and experience the real consequences of those choices.

The Localism Bill contains several measures to achieve this. The Government has begun consulting on proposals for a new homes bonus. We would match the additional council tax raised over the following six years for new homes and properties brought back into use. It is proposed that there will be an additional amount for affordable homes.

I made clear earlier this month that we intend to introduce changes to the community infrastructure levy - making sure that the benefits of growth are felt at a very local level indeed. We plan to require in law that local authorities set aside a meaningful proportion of revenue raised to be spent on infrastructure as neighbourhoods see fit.

And we will introduce neighbourhood planning alongside existing plans - placing an unprecedented level of influence and power at a very local level.

The principle is simple. Local people come together and agree, ""this is what we want our area to look like. Here is where we want the new homes to go and how we want them designed; here is where we want new shops and offices; here are the green spaces we want to protect.""

Where people are most keen to take control and have certainty over development, they will be able to confer full planning permission, so that where the local community is crying out for new homes, developers can get on with building them. In other areas, people will be able to grant outline planning permission - with conditions on, say, the design details.

When the neighbourhood plan has been prepared, people will vote on them in a local referendum. With a simple majority, the plan will come into force. This is a rethinking of how planning operates - creating new pressures and powers that operate from the bottom up, rather than the top down. It offers a scope for self-determination unheard-of until now. Localism in planning will create the freedom and the incentives for those places that want to grow, to do so, and to reap the benefits. It's a reason to say yes.

I look forward to discussing these proposals in more detail with many of you when the Localism Bill is published and begins to make its way through parliament.

Opening up planning will requires non-legislative changes too. I'd be first to argue that planning demands special skills, but I don't think the best way to enable planners to do their job is to set endless prescription and guidance. The current sum of circulars, policy statements and so forth is bigger than the complete Works of Shakespeare, and not nearly as entertaining. Guidance on this scale flirts with the absurd: there's no way a practitioner can keep it all in mind. Let alone the poor non-expert. This is a harmful side-effect: opacity is a barrier to community involvement.

It's time for a radical review to simplify and streamline policy and guidance, to make it easier for community groups to understand and engage with it, and to give proper scope for planners to use their professional discretion.

Our proposals imply changes to the role of town planners. In one sense, planners have been the first victims of the flaws of the current planning system. Often, their job has involved much too much development control - saying yes and no to individual projects on a case by case basis - and too little genuine planning, thinking about the long-term needs of an area, talking to local people, and drawing up positive proposals for the future.

Planners have become a lightning rod for people's sense of frustration. Instead of being the agents of imposition, they should have much more scope to help local people articulate their vision for their town or village or neighbourhood. As Ann Skippers, the RTPI President for 2010, said earlier this year:

> ""We should be proud to say [...] when we are asked, that we are planners. Say it well and say it loudly and say it again if you need to.""

Neighbourhood planning - which will see planners working with and for the community - should help achieve what Anne and I both want to see - planners being properly valued and respected for what they do.

There are three common arguments made against greater community involvement in planning.

The first argument is about willingness. It says, do people really want to get involved in local planning issues? Aren't they busy enough with their jobs and family lives?

In fact, people care deeply about the look and feel of the places where they live. Planning can in fact be the gateway that gets people involved in civic life. They might start by signing a petition to protect a local tree - they might end up volunteering on a regular basis, standing as a school governor, or becoming a councillor.

The second argument is about capacity. It says: even if they are interested, have people got the capacity to articulate what they want - and make a meaningful contribution to debate?

There are two points to make in response to that. There's an inherent difference in expectations between centralists and localists. Centralists are a glum lot. Their outlook is predicated on the idea that, left to themselves, people can't make decisions in their own best interests. Localists, by contrast, are optimistic about people's good sense, generosity, and ability to make sound decisions. In planning - as in other areas of life - we start from the basis that people are inherently capable.

But planning also of course requires the application of specialist skills. We recognise that in some circumstances people will need some support to make the most of the opportunity to get involved. That's why, if a very local area wants to draw up its neighbourhood plan - we will require the local authority to provide support. We will also fund independent advice, so that local communities and neighbourhood groups who are new to the topic can learn from what has worked well in other areas.

The third argument against local planning is about equality. It says - are you, in effect, empowering those who are already powerful - giving the well-organised an opportunity to channel unwanted development towards the places where the less well-organised live?

There are several points to make in response here. One is that the provision of advice and support should enable those who want to, to draw up their neighbourhood plan, no matter where they live. Another is that there will be some safeguards in the system. Neighbourhood plans will need to be consistent with wider local plans. If the wider areas needs lots of new houses, they neighbourhood plan will not be a means to refuse development altogether. An independent assessment will make sure that neighbourhood and local plans are consistent.

But there's a much bigger point. This concern is based on the assumption that people come to the table thinking ""development is bad."" In fact, if local people have a chance to voice an opinion, and to see and feel the benefits of development, they have reasons to say ""yes.""

There is significant change ahead for planning. Taken as a whole, our reforms will help get England out of the housebuilding trough, make businesses see planning as a reason to invest, not a disadvantage, and give planners opportunity and encouragement to do what they do best: to create amazing, inspirational places.

Above all they will give communities a far greater sense of ownership over decisions that make a big difference to their quality of life. They will allow for the exercise of genuine power at a local level; and put the ideals of the Big Society at the very heart of planning.

I look forward to working with you all to make sure these reforms deliver the change we all want to see.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,"One Whitehall Place, London",,,,30-Nov-2010,making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

All nations are shaped by geography and history. America is founded on an idea of limitless freedom and space. Historically, if you disagreed with someone, you could head West. The answer to conflict about access to limited resources was the wagon train.

In this country, the answer was the orderly queue. Planning arises from this same tradition of sharing space in a fair, rational and ordered way. It is an inherently civilised activity. By making places that work, it encourages investment and promotes growth. This is a unique kind of public service, and a profession that deserves to be valued and respected.

But we have arrived at the sad state today where planning, far from being held in public esteem, is viewed with mistrust or worse. If you Google ""planning decision"" plus ""crazy"" you get 17,000 results; plus ""stupid,"" 18,000 results. At the Planning Officers' Society conference last week the backdrop was a blow-up of the front page of a local paper lambasting a local authority, and that's indicative of a much wider malaise.

Instead of planning being seen as the forum and the discipline whereby people can shape the places where they live for the better, it has become a crucible for controversy and acrimony. Granted, planning is all about difficult decisions - and not everyone can get exactly what they want every time - but there is a degree of pessimism that is deeply unhealthy. In some places the default response to proposed development has become unconditional opposition. This is a bleak prospect.

This Government is proposing fundamental reform. We want to restore the reputation of planning as a service that works for the public, and that the public feel is on their side. Instead of being principally a means of arbitrating disputes, it should be a positive process, where people come together and agree a vision for the future of the place where they live. It should also - crucially - be a system that delivers more growth.

I want to make this crystal clear. I am pro-development. The built environment offers some of the glories of our towns and cities. This city alone is home to thousands of buildings, palaces, castles, homes, towers and bridges which lift the spirit, express local character, and draw visitors from the world over. In rural areas, many of the villages and hamlets that people love best are examples not of nature in the raw but of the sensitive, imaginative interplay between the built environment and the natural environment.

Our aim with the Localism Bill is not to prevent new building, but to promote it.

Every single proposal in the Bill has been subject to a rigorous test: will this help us unlock growth? Take the third party right of appeal, for example. This was an idea mooted in policy consultations released before the election by both parties currently in government. But it's paradoxical on one hand to design a system that's about putting choice first - that's about giving local people better opportunities to draw up high-quality plans for their neighbourhoods and local areas - and then, with the other hand, to give greater chances to appeal against decisions made on the basis of those plans. So the third party right of appeal is not part of the Bill.

Instead, we have proposals which go back to first principles - not just tinkering with processes, but rebooting the way we think about planning altogether.

The first shortcoming in the current system is that too often the communities and neighbourhoods that host new development do not feel a direct benefit. They do not share in the proceeds of growth. And when new development has taken place, all too often it has not been matched with investment in infrastructure - in transport, schools, or hospitals.

Our goal is to increase and underline the local benefits of development. Authorities that take responsibility and encourage growth should be recognised proportionately. In our consultation the New Homes Bonus, we're proposing that for every new home that gets built in its area, a local authority should get six years of matched council tax funding, with an extra supplement for affordable homes. And instead of operating under direction from the Treasury, local authorities should be free to spend this money on local priorities: whether it's keeping council tax at an affordable level, investing in homes, or improving local services.

We also want to make sure that benefits are felt at a very local, neighbourhood level. Take the Community Infrastructure Levy. We are proposing that councils should be required to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the charge on new development is spent at that very local, neighbourhood level, nearest to where development takes place. The people who see the new estate going up at the end of the street should feel the benefit of extra investment in community facilities and improved transport.

The second shortcoming we want to address is a lack of meaningful public participation in planning. The evidence of inquiry by design in this country, and other models of getting people involved on the continent, suggest that early involvement in the decision-making process means people are more likely to be supportive of local development. The more people participate, the more likely it is that development is to take place.

Compare and contrast with the approach taken in Regional Spatial Strategies. Ultimately these strategies, with their housing targets imposed on local areas, were more effective at generating resentment than at getting houses built. The simple fact is that people don't like being told what to do. In several cases, the overwhelming majority of public responses to consultation were negative. The Bill is designed to scrap the Strategies once and for all.

In their place, we're introducing a duty on councils to work together across borders in a way that reflects their genuine shared interests. Over three fifths of people in England now live in parts of the country where there is a local economic partnership. These partnerships show business and political leaders working together and thinking strategically to create jobs and boost the economy - localism and growth hand in hand.

At the same time, we want to create more options for local communities to exercise influence in the planning process. Neighbourhood planning will let people come together at a very local level and decide, together, where the new homes, shops and businesses should go, and what they should look like. The local authority will provide technical support so that the proposals that local people draw up are of decent technical quality.

This is a very significant change in the way we think about planning. This is not a chance to be ""consulted then ignored,"" but to wield real power. If approved by a majority of residents in a local referendum, a neighbourhood development plan must be brought into force by the local authority.

There will of course be safeguards in the system. This is a Bill is firmly anchored in the need for growth, and no man is an island. Neighbourhood planning isn't a way of a group declaring a UDI from the wider area they live in. Their plans must be consistent with the needs and ambitions of residents of the wider area too - including the need for economic growth. That's why it's incredibly important for councils to keep on drawing up their own plans: there's no excuse to slow down and every reason to speed up.

And, to be explicit, if there's an overwhelming need for new homes in the local authority area, the neighbourhood plan is not a way for a neighbourhood to refuse to host its fair share. Though they can, if the wish, grant permission for a greater number of homes than the local authority expects. In other words, neighbourhood planning is not a way of saying ""no"" to any development. It can be a way of saying ""yes"" to more.

And in fact - with the new homes bonus and the changes to the community infrastructure levy - local people have more reasons than ever to do so.

This is the essence of our proposals. Opportunities for communities to make genuine choices about the future of their neighbourhoods, and genuine reasons to say ""yes"" to development: the foundations for renewed growth.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,"Adam Smith Institute, London",,,,2-Feb-2011,giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The Minister of State for Decentralisation (Mr. Greg Clark):

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has today issued a call to action on growth, publishing an ambitious set of proposals to help rebuild Britain's economy. The planning system has a key role to play in this, by ensuring that the sustainable development needed to support economic growth is able to proceed as easily as possible. We will work quickly to reform the planning system to achieve this, but the Government recognises that many of these actions will take some months to deliver, and that there is a pressing need to ensure that the planning system does everything it can to help secure a swift return to economic growth. This statement therefore sets out the steps the Government expects local planning authorities to take with immediate effect.

The Government's top priority in reforming the planning system is to promote sustainable economic growth and jobs. Government's clear expectation is that the answer to development and growth should wherever possible be 'yes', except where this would compromise the key sustainable development principles set out in national planning policy.

The Chancellor has today set out further detail on our commitment to introduce a strong presumption in favour of sustainable development in the forthcoming National Planning Policy Framework, which will expect local planning authorities to plan positively for new development; to deal promptly and favourably with applications that comply with up-to-date plans and national planning policies; and wherever possible to approve applications where plans are absent, out of date, silent or indeterminate.

Local planning authorities should therefore press ahead without delay in preparing up-to-date development plans, and should use that opportunity to be proactive in driving and supporting the growth that this country needs. They should make every effort to identify and meet the housing, business and other development needs of their areas, and respond positively to wider opportunities for growth, taking full account of relevant economic signals such as land prices. Authorities should work together to ensure that needs and opportunities that extend beyond (or cannot be met within) their own boundaries are identified and accommodated in a sustainable way, such as housing market requirements that cover a number of areas, and the strategic infrastructure necessary to support growth.

When deciding whether to grant planning permission, local planning authorities should support enterprise and facilitate housing, economic and other forms of sustainable development. Where relevant - and consistent with their statutory obligations - they should therefore:

> (i) consider fully the importance of national planning policies aimed at fostering economic growth and employment, given the need to ensure a return to robust growth after the recent recession
> 
> (ii) take into account the need to maintain a flexible and responsive supply of land for key sectors, including housing
> 
> (iii) consider the range of likely economic, environmental and social benefits of proposals; including long term or indirect benefits such as increased consumer choice, more viable communities and more robust local economies (which may, where relevant, include matters such as job creation and business productivity)
> 
> (iv) be sensitive to the fact that local economies are subject to change and so take a positive approach to development where new economic data suggest that prior assessments of needs are no longer up-to-date
> 
> (v) ensure that they do not impose unnecessary burdens on development.

In determining planning applications, local planning authorities are obliged to have regard to all relevant considerations. They should ensure that they give appropriate weight to the need to support economic recovery, that applications that secure sustainable growth are treated favourably (consistent with policy in PPS4), and that they can give clear reasons for their decisions.

To further ensure that development can go ahead, all local authorities should reconsider, at developers' request, existing section 106 agreements that currently render schemes unviable, and where possible modify those obligations to allow development to proceed; provided this continues to ensure that the development remains acceptable in planning terms.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will take the principles in this statement into account when determining applications that come before him for decision. In particular he will attach significant weight to the need to secure economic growth and employment.

Benefits to the economy should, where relevant, be an important consideration when other development-related consents are being determined, including heritage, environmental, energy and transport consents. The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and the Secretary of State for Transport have consequently agreed that to the extent it accords with the relevant statutory provisions and national policies, decisions on these other consents should place particular weight on the potential economic benefits offered by an application. They will reflect this principle in relevant decisions that come before them and encourage their agencies and non departmental bodies to adopt the same approach for the consents for which those other bodies are directly responsible.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,,written-statement,23-Mar-2011,,,giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

**Joint article by the Secretary of State and the Chancellor**

Planning reform is key to our economic recovery. Opponents claim, falsely, the government is putting the countryside in peril. We say that sticking with the old, failed planning system puts at risk young people's future prosperity and quality of life. No one should underestimate our determination to win this battle. We will fight for jobs, prosperity and the right protection for our countryside.

Since the planning system was established in 1947, it has grown inexorably more complicated. Between 2005 and 2010, Whitehall issued some 3,250 pages of guidance. As central prescription has burgeoned, the process has become more and more wasteful.

Today, planning delays cost the economy £3bn a year. It is twice as expensive to get planning permission in London's West End as in Paris, and 10 times more than in Brussels. In a global economy, where skills and capital are more mobile than ever, our planning system is a deterrent to international investment, and a barrier to the expansion of home-grown enterprise.

When planning acts as a brake on growth, and on the much needed new jobs and new businesses, reform is imperative. Current policy runs to thousands of pages, much written in technical detail. There is nothing democratic about a system that makes it virtually impossible for communities to understand how important decisions are made.

House building rates before we took office had fallen to their lowest for generations. The average first-time buyer is already well into their thirties. A lack of new homes is sombre news for every young family waiting to get a foot on the ladder.

The house building slump was due to a range of factors, but a complex and adversarial planning system, which left many communities resentful, was part of the problem. The aim of a National Planning Policy Framework is simple. The draft brings together the policy and principles that guide decisions about how our country should grow. It reduces policy from more than 1,000 pages to under 100, and will pave the way for swifter, clearer decisions. In recent years, planning has come to be seen as a tool to say 'no' to growth; as a means to delay and block. This government will change that. Instead of stopping development, we want to support the right development. At the heart of the framework is a 'presumption in favour of sustainable development'.

This means the answers to proposals for responsible, careful growth should be 'yes', unless there are strong reasons to the contrary. A recent survey showed that a majority of the public support the idea of a simpler planning system and a presumption of favour of sustainable development.

Among the most vociferous in their calls for government to bring forward a growth plan have - surprise, surprise - been among the most vociferous opponents to one of its central planks. The government is ready to debate the framework - based on facts, not myths. The idea that presumption in favour means that growth will be able to take place wherever, whenever and however is false. Protections for the green belt, for National Parks and Areas of Outstanding National Beauty continue. The framework insists on high environmental standards and good design. Poorly-designed and poorly-located development is in no-one's interest.

Nor will our reforms give communities less say. On the contrary. We are abolishing the old regional strategies and housing targets. Councils will continue to exercise a vital role, drawing up plans for their area.

Through neighbourhood planning, a key new right in the Localism Bill, communities will soon have the chance to say where they want new shops, homes and businesses to go, and what they should look like.

Reforming a slow and inefficient planning system will be good news for the small business looking to expand; for the young family hoping for more affordable house prices; and for the community wanting to decide on their own future. This is our opportunity to unlock the new investment and new jobs the country needs. We cannot afford to miss it.

I am today implementing the commitments made in the Coalition Agreement to decentralise the planning system by giving Local Authorities the freedom to prevent overdevelopment of neighbourhoods and 'garden grabbing'.

The impact of the old policy approach, set out in [Planning Policy Statement 3](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/pps3statement), is that the combination of a national target for brownfield land, alongside the definition of gardens as brownfield land, has meant local authorities feeling forced into granting planning permission for unwanted development on garden land - simply to maintain the brownfield target.

To bring an end to these detrimental effects, we are today therefore removing gardens from the definition of previously developed land in Planning Policy Statement 3.

We are also removing the requirement upon local authorities to have regard to the national minimum density for housing set out in paragraph 47 of PPS3. This policy has resulted in local authorities not having enough flexibility to set density ranges that suit the local needs in their areas - particularly for family houses.

I am today re-issuing _Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing (PPS3)_ with the following changes:

  * the definition of previously developed land in Annex B now excludes private residential gardens
  * the national indicative minimum density of 30 dwellings per hectare is deleted from paragraph 47

Together these changes put power back in the hands of local authorities and communities to take the decisions that are best for them, and decide for themselves the best locations and types of development in their areas.

This reissued policy document sets out the Secretary of State's policy on previously developed land and housing density. Local Planning Authorities and the Planning Inspectorate are expected to have regard to the policy in preparing development plans and, where relevant, to take it into account as a material consideration when determining planning applications.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/publicdisorder,Public disorder: local response and support,"* * *

I wish to outline the steps we are taking to support and rebuild local communities after the shameful criminal activity of recent days.

### Recovery Scheme

Affected local authorities will continue to be eligible for the long-standing Bellwin scheme to meet immediate and sizeable recovery costs. However, the thresholds in the existing Scheme mean that most councils would only receive assistance above costs in excess of c.£1million, and we assess that many affected local authorities may not benefit.

To support local councils, I am establishing a new Recovery Scheme of up to £10 million, allocated to councils via Section 31 grants. Councils will be able to claim back the costs directly incurred in making areas safe, clean and clear again. This fund can also be used to support councils who use their powers to offer council tax discounts or council tax relief to those whose homes have been damaged but are still habitable.

In this extraordinary situation, my department is also willing to meet the immediate costs of re-housing those made homeless by these disturbances. This can be done under established homelessness funding processes.

Seriously damaged domestic and business properties will be taken off the respective valuation lists, and I have strongly encouraged the Valuation Office Agency to do so as promptly as possible. This removes any liability for council tax or business rates.

### High Street Support Scheme

With my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, we will provide an additional £20 million to create a new High Street Support Scheme. The flexible scheme will be aimed at supporting the specific streets and areas where businesses suffered most as a result of the disturbances. Local Authorities will be able to use it to fund the proportion of hardship relief from business rates that would otherwise fall to them , and to help affected firms to get back up and running quickly, for instance if assistance is needed with business clear-up, replacement of equipment, or costs of temporary accommodation. A quarter of the cost of hardship rate relief is normally borne by local authorities and three quarters by central government.

We will keep the steps we have taken under review. This is an evolving situation and we are working to assess the cost to affected businesses. We will announce further details of the Recovery Scheme and High Street Support Scheme next week and expect that councils will be able to make claims and receive grants quickly and easily.

In addition, any individual, homeowner or small business that has suffered damage to or loss of their buildings or property as a result of rioting, can seek compensation under the Riot Damages Act. Importantly this compensation is paid to the uninsured too. It is normally the case that claims must be received within 14 days, but to give people more time to submit these claims we will extend the period to 42 days. We will urge the police to respond helpfully and swiftly to all legitimate claims, and the Government is working closely with forces, to ensure they have the funds they need to meet the costs of the operation itself and any claims that they may receive under the Riot Damages Act.

It is not just for the state to support local firms affected by these criminal actions. I encourage every local resident to make an effort to shop locally in this and coming weeks and support the local high streets which are the lifeblood of our communities.

### Sanctions against criminals

Crime does not pay and I want to send out a strong signal to these violent criminals.

It is already a ground for eviction in existing legislation if a tenant or a member of their family is involved in anti-social behaviour or criminal activity in their local neighbourhood. I would urge landlords to consider this provision. We welcome the decision of Hammersmith and Fulham, Greenwich, Southwark and Manchester among others to seek to evict their social tenants found guilty of rioting, and would encourage more local authorities to follow suit.

My department is proposing to make necessary changes to housing legislation so that landlords will have even stronger powers to evict tenants who engage in serious anti-social behaviour or criminal activity such as rioting beyond the local neighbourhood. We intend to consult on this proposal immediately as part of the ongoing consultation on anti-social behaviour.

### Tribute to local communities

The professionalism shown by all fire-fighters across the nation over the last few days has been outstanding, and I would like to thank all of them for their efforts.

Fire crews have carried out their duties in the face of shameful criminal behaviour of rioters, who have physically attacked the very people protecting their homes and communities from arson.

We all owe them all a debt of gratitude for their tireless work protecting lives and communities, and we have a fire and rescue service of which we can rightly proud.

Local councils have also risen to the challenge, leading the clear-up in their local areas and supporting those worst affected. There have been some striking examples of positive social action, uniting our communities across class, colour and creed.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,11-Aug-2011,,,bringing-people-together-in-strong-united-communities,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

![embed: ](http://www.policyreview.tv/newplayer/player805.swf)

You might have noticed over the couple of weeks that I've been making some remarks and comments about the chief executives of councils. I can reveal today that it's all been part of a heavily planned, tightly executed campaign. I've decided to run to be Chief Executive of Solace. And I'm looking forward to hearing what David has to say.

A friend of mine, a senator from Wisconsin, once said that ""if you don't like the folks, don't be in our business."" The previous government didn't like the folks. It didn't trust them. It always believed that it knew best. And we've just had thirteen years of the most centralising government in history. A controlling government, obsessed with targets, inspections and micromanagement. It left local government toothless. Community groups out in the cold. Residents powerless to change anything.

We've all seen the results. Voting rates plummeted - there's no point in voting if nothing changes. No matter who they vote for the council always gets in. There was no room for creativity or innovation in public services. You just followed the rules and ticked the boxes. And the money followed the power: so London and the South East grew at the expense of everywhere else in the country.

So when people ask me about my priorities in Government, I have 3 very clear priorities: localism, and we'll weave that into everything we do from parks to finance to policy. My second priority is localism, and my third is… localism.

Because if you want to restore faith in politics, you make sure that local government is properly accountable to the voters.

If you want to rebuild a fragile national economy, then you don't strangle business with red tape and let bloated regional bodies make all the decisions.

If you want people to feel connected to their communities. Proud of their communities. Then you give people a real say over what happens in their communities. And the power to make a difference.

Because we like the folks. We don't think we know better than they do. And we trust them to know what's best for them.

So we are determined to wrest control from the bureaucrats, the quangos, and central government departments. Taking power pushing it as far away from Whitehall as possible. I want you to understand, I am deadly serious about this.

We are definitely going to do this. We are going to shake up the balance of power in this country. We are going to change the nature of the constitution. Be in no doubt about our commitment to localism. I know I look like an unlikely revolutionary, but the revolution starts here.

It won't be in a single action or a single law. It will be through dramatic and bold actions, but also small and incremental changes. Localism is the principle, the mantra, and defines everything we do.

You might think, well, all governments talk like this. But we've proved it by getting on and doing it.

  * We've made HIPS history and already the number of homes being put up for sale has gone up by 35 per cent.
  * We've given a lifeline to thousands of businesses in ports who had huge backdated business rates hanging over their head.
  * We've scrapped the top down housing targets and meaningless regional spatial strategies.
  * We've put an end to the 'garden grabbing' which has seen acres of land lost to intensive development.
  * We've cut the ring fencing and red tape which comes attached to hundreds of millions pounds worth of central government grants.
  * We're leading by example in making central government more open, more transparent, more accountable.
  * And we're showing we're serious about saving money. Taking pay cuts ourselves, shining the spotlight on public sector pay, and leaving the public to draw their own conclusions.

That's not bad for four weeks work, if I do say so myself. And we have more in store for the next few weeks.

Everything we've done has been about giving up control, restoring the balance of power. So by the time that the localism bill is introduced later in the year, we'll already start to localism taking shape and becoming a reality.

That bill will go even further in giving voters more power over local government and local spending. It will free up local government from the shackles of central government control. And it will continue the overhaul of the planning system: to put the community back in charge of how their area develops.

But there are three things I want you to understand about localism.

First, if this is going to have an effect, local government has got to be ready to step up to the plate. Seize the opportunities that are coming your way. Don't wait around for us to tell you what to do.

There are already councils who are stepping up.

Windsor and Maidenhead, with their ground breaking recycling scheme, showing the future of modern refuge collection.

Essex, with its hugely ambitious programme to transform the way it works and improve the services it offers to residents.

City Hall, putting huge amounts of data online as part of their commitment to transparency and accountability.

These councils aren't waiting around.

Kent's not waiting around. Hammersmith and Fulham aren't waiting around. No council should be waiting around.

Second, localism isn't just about giving power back to local government. We're not talking about a tug of war between you and me.

It's even more important that we push power downwards and outwards to the lowest possible level. Out to the folks themselves.

Because if people know they can make a difference, then there's a reason to stand up and be counted.

We want to make sure people can take control and take responsibility in their street, their estate, their town. Solving problems and taking action for themselves. With neighbourhoods, people working together, as the basis for the big society.

And my third and final point is that this means there has never been a better time to be involved in local government.

No one working in local government signed up to be told what to do for the rest of their lives by Whitehall.

So there is a real opportunity for councillors today:

  * to have much more fulfilling, rewarding careers
  * to exercise genuine choice and power
  * to change the face of their neighbourhoods
  * to actually make a difference to people's lives

Local government will no longer be the poodle of central government. And together, we are going to be part of the most radical shake up of power there has been for generations.

In our first two months in government we have demonstrated our commitment to localism, decentralisation and rolling back regional government in England. We have announced the abolition of Regional Development Agencies, abolished the Regional Strategies, ended funding for the Regional Leaders' Boards (the successors to the Regional Assemblies) and are closing the Government Office for London.

We have taken these steps because they are right in principle and as part of a fundamental transfer of power from central Government down to local councils and down further to local communities. We have done so to reduce spending on bureaucracy and protect front-line services against the backdrop of an unsustainable budget deficit and national debt.

We do not believe the arbitrary government regions to be a tier of administration that is efficient, effective or popular. Citizens across England identify with their county, their city, their town, their borough and their neighbourhood. We should recognise that the case for elected regional government was overwhelmingly rejected by the people in the 2004 North East Referendum. Unelected regional government equally lacks democratic legitimacy, and its continuing existence has created a democratic deficit.

In the Coalition's _Programme for Government_ we said we would consider the case for abolition of the eight remaining Government Offices.

I am announcing today the Government's intention in principle to abolish the remaining eight Government Offices, subject to the satisfactory resolution of consequential issues through the Spending Review.

The final decisions on the future of the Government Offices, including arrangements for closure and for the transfer of on-going functions, will be made at the end of the Spending Review in the autumn.

The Government Offices are not a legal entity. They act on behalf of 13 Government Departments and are staffed by Civil Servants from these Departments. Communities and Local Government is the biggest contributor to Government Offices providing 41 per cent and 33 per cent of funds and staff respectively in 2010/11. The Home Office; Departments for Education; Business, Innovation and Skills; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Transport are also employers of Government Office staff.

We are making good progress with our programme of radical reform to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on local authorities and businesses, including removing the inflated local government performance regime and doing away with the unnecessary regional tier. Consequently many of the functions Government Offices undertook are no longer necessary. By announcing our intention in principle now, we will further progress our programme of reform, allow staff, councils and departments to take account of this, and make an earlier start in the Spending Review on securing savings for the public purse.

I believe that the original intentions behind the establishment of the Government Offices for the Regions (to join up different Departmental teams outside London into a 'one stop shop) have been lost. Such functions are no longer necessary in an internet age and given the Coalition Government's commitment to genuine decentralisation and devolution of power.

There are, however, some Government Office functions, such as arrangements for resilience and civil contingencies, which will need to continue. The Spending Review process will be used to test which activities currently carried out by the Government Offices should continue, and to decide the most cost-effective on-going arrangements.

The Spending Review will also consider arrangements for the redeployment or release of Government Office staff, and for sharing as appropriate the savings, costs, assets and liabilities arising from the decision.

We should be clear: the Government Offices are not voices of the region in Whitehall. They have become agents of Whitehall to intervene and interfere in localities, and are a fundamental part of the 'command and control' apparatus of England's over-centralised state.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,22-Jul-2010,,,giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

![Eric Pickles addressing the LGA meeting](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1653702.jpg)Before I start, want to first congratulate Baroness Eaton on her recent ennoblement. I witnessed her entry into the Lords last week with her family and friends. There was a point I had to pretend I was suffering from hayfever.

Local government couldn't find a better champion or a stronger advocate to represent them.

I've actually got two versions of my speech this morning.

The shorter one: I'd just stand up and say: thanks for the offer. I'm delighted to accept, and sit down again.

But I guess you want to get your money's worth so I'll give you the extended version.

The LGA is absolutely right: we need to find a better way to do business.

> ""My job as Secretary of State is not to sit in my office, making all the decisions, pulling all the strings, coming up with more and more original ways to annoy you. It's to get out of your way: and to get everything else out of your way too.""

Even if there had been no economic crisis.

Even if we weren't saddled with public debt.

The balance of power in the country is utterly wrong.

Everything that's happened over the past thirteen years was in my view an attempt to hoard power.

To take control and democratic legitimacy away from councils and communities.

And turn local government into local management of services.

It's time to put this right.

My job as Secretary of State is not to sit in my office, making all the decisions, pulling all the strings, coming up with more and more original ways to annoy you. It's to get out of your way: and to get everything else out of your way too.

That's what localism means. Pushing power out to local government, and beyond into neighbourhoods and communities.

I've always believed that actions speak louder than words.

So I hardly need to remind you of everything we've done over the past few months to make this happen.

Taken out regional government. Scrapped housing targets. Ended the comprehensive area assessment.

> ""The LGA knows better than anyone else where the challenges lie and how to overcome them.""

Put councils and communities back in control of their own destinies.  
   
Now as you'll know, this is the last day that Parliament is sitting before the House rises.

But I can promise you that we will not be sitting back in our deckchairs for six weeks.

We'll be keeping up the momentum.

We're already working on this productivity programme together.

We're also already working together on 'place based area budgets'. I love the idea. I hate the name.

I want something that actually means something. Let's call them what they are: community budgets.

I'm not the only one who loves the idea of community budgets, by the way. The Prime Minister loves them. The DPM loves them. The Chancellor loves them. There's huge interest right across Whitehall.

'Total Place' may have been a step in the right direction, but it was the smallest, most begrudging step possible. Loosening the leash a tiny bit rather than just simply letting you off it.

It was a bit like local government was a fifteen year old girl with really strict parents.

They let you go down the dance for the first time.

But then totally cramped your style by parking round the corner to watch what you were up to and made you go home at half past nine.

Not so much 'total place'. More like 'know your place'.

I don't want to be the Dad hanging round the corner. You can get yourselves down the dance. You can stay out all night if you want. Let your hair down - before it all goes like mine.

There's a lot of work to do to make it happen, but if we work together we can.

The LGA has a hugely important leadership role. To make sure that the sector isn't let down by a few clueless councils who won't seize these opportunities.

The LGA knows better than anyone else where the challenges lie and how to overcome them.

We can clearly deliver 'more for less.' You've said you can achieve better outcomes and faster improvement, for less money.

I believe you. I want to put you in charge of that money as soon as possible. And I want to make rapid progress on this over the next few weeks.

Of course, I'll need your commitment to the same standards we're asking of anyone using public money.

For example, it would only be right that you were subject to the same freedom of information rules that central government or councils are; so the public can ask questions about where the money's going.

But more than just following the rules, I really want the LGA to embrace the same spirit of openness, transparency and accountability I'm asking from councils.

If councils can put all their spending above £500 online. If my Department can do it. Then can't the LGA do it too?

So I'll ask you, the LGA, the same question that I'm asking councils: show me the money. Show me where it is spent. Let the public see just how this valuable institution spends its money.

> ""I'm not going to tell you what to do any more. So you don't have to keep running and asking me what you should be doing.""

Now, the LGA offer is a big challenge to me, and to government. I think it's only fair to challenge back a little bit.

I've sometimes been disappointed with the ambition from some councils.

Take, for example, the proposals which came forward on the Sustainable Communities Act.

We are committed to embracing the best ideas. And we want to work with you to decide which ones we can make progress on over the summer.

But to be frank there aren't all that many.

Some of them are either barmy or banal.

And what was even more worrying is that councils were asking for the power to do things that they can already do.

I know that there are undoubtedly frustrations and blockages in your way.

But some of them exist in people's minds rather than reality.

You might as well know what you've got and use it, while I work on giving you more.

Like this power of general competence that local government's been crying out for.

I totally support it. I think you need it. And I'll give it to you in the localism bill.

Obviously, there have got to be limits.

I'm not going to be the Secretary of State who let Passport to Pimlico happen on his watch.

And I think it's reasonable that councils shouldn't use their new found freedom to saddle up the horses, arm their citizens and invade France.

Apart from that, the world will be your oyster.

But at the same time, I ask myself the question: why is it that only around fifteen per cent of councils have used their power to promote wellbeing? Why a measly fifteen percent?

I want to give you the power and the freedom you want.

But power to sit on your hands and freedom to twiddle your thumbs isn't real power or real freedom.

I'm not going to tell you what to do any more. So you don't have to keep running and asking me what you should be doing. Whether this or that is allowed.

The local enterprise partnerships are a really good example of this.

They've gone down a storm with the local business community.

Both the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Chamber of Commerce have welcomed the new set up, and the opportunities this presents for small businesses.

But it needs councils to really step up and play the leading role in the local economy you say you've always wanted.

Instead, I keep being asked questions: Can I do this, Secretary of State? Is it ok if I do that, Secretary of State? What are the real guidelines?

This is the first time central government has gone to communities and asked them what they want to do. So let me be absolutely clear.

Be as ambitious as you can. Be as radical as you like. Be as bold as you want.

Make me an offer I can't refuse. (I use that in the non-Mafia sense).

I won't stand in your way.

If you've got genuinely radical, genuinely promising ideas, I'll shout them from the rooftops.

I will be your champion in Cabinet. We've already made sure that councils will have a central role in new health reforms. Who would have believed Councils would be so central to the running of the NHS?

I will tear down all the barriers and get rid of all the bureaucracy which stands in your way.

I will turn Whitehall upside down to make this new relationship work.

I absolutely trust local government to deliver.

So over the summer, just get on and do it.

You and me are going to change the constitution, change the balance of power. LEPs are a real opportunity for local economies.

This is a once in a generation offer. Seize it. Take it.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/1935022,Review of statutory duties on local authorities,"* * *

The Minister for Decentralisation (Greg Clark): In March, I announced our intention to take stock of the statutory duties placed on local authorities by central government and at that time, I committed to keeping the House informed of progress.

At no point in recent history has there been a comprehensive list of the legal duties placed on councils.

The Government therefore agreed with the Local Government Association that we should compile a list of these duties to give clarity about what these duties are. We recognise that many ensure the provision of vital frontline services but there are others which may be creating unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy for local authorities.

We published the draft list in March and invited local authorities and the general public to respond, identifying any existing duties that needed to be added to the list to make it more comprehensive and identify any that were redundant. For the avoidance of doubt, inclusion of a particular duty on the overall list was not an indication that the Government was considering that duty for removal.

The opportunity to comment closed in April. We received much public interest with over 6,000 respondents. Many respondents focused on protecting vital services, such as support for disabled children and children with special educational needs, allotments and libraries, all of which we have committed to maintaining. There was also significant interest in removing process-based requirements placed on local authorities as an important step in moving towards a decentralised system of governance.

This review has not happened in isolation. For example, the Munro Review on child protection and the Law Commission's work on adult social care are currently being considered by Government. This work did not seek to pre-empt the outcomes of such reviews.

From the outset, we have been clear this is an exercise in compiling as comprehensive a list of duties as possible and obtaining feedback on those thought to be redundant. We said unequivocally that the Government would not remove any statutory duties that protect vital front line services.

In closing this review I am today publishing a summary of responses and the latest revised list of duties, which has been updated with feedback from the responses received. I have made both available on the Department's website: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/tacklingburdens/reviewstatutoryduties/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/tacklingburdens/reviewstatutoryduties/).

Also, I have placed a copy of the summary by my department and the latest revised list of duties in the Library of the House.

At the point of publication of the consultation, we had identified that there were at least 1,294 duties imposed on each local authority. Between 1997 - 2009, 647 duties were imposed that are still current today. The table below illustrates the introduction of new duties by government administration:

#### Table: Statutory duties placed on local government by central government extant in 2011 by government administration

  
  


This exercise has successfully enabled a clearer picture of the requirements placed on local authorities, and created a valuable record that had previously never existed.

Any future consideration of whether to remove specific duties or associated guidance will be a separate process, and we will consult further as appropriate.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,,written-statement,30-Jun-2011,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/regionalstrategies,Revoking regional strategies,"* * *

The Secretary of State for the Department of Communities and Local Government (Eric Pickles): Today I am making the first step to deliver our commitment in the coalition agreement to ""rapidly abolish Regional Spatial Strategies and return decision-making powers on housing and planning to local councils"", by revoking Regional Strategies.

Regional Strategies added unnecessary bureaucracy to the planning system. They were a failure. They were expensive and time-consuming. They alienated people, pitting them against development instead of encouraging people to build in their local area.

The revocation of Regional Strategies will make local spatial plans, drawn up in conformity with national policy, the basis for local planning decisions. The new planning system will be clear, efficient and will put greater power in the hands of local people, rather than regional bodies.

Imposed central targets will be replaced with powerful incentives so that people see the benefits of building. The coalition agreement makes a clear commitment to providing local authorities with real incentives to build new homes. I can confirm that this will ensure that those local authorities which take action now to consent and support the construction of new homes will receive direct and substantial benefit from their actions. Because we are committed to housing growth, introducing these incentives will be a priority and we aim to do so early in the spending review period. We will consult on the detail of this later this year. These incentives will encourage local authorities and communities to increase their aspirations for housing and economic growth, and to deliver sustainable development in a way that allows them to control the way in which their villages, towns and cities change. Our revisions to the planning system will also support renewable energy and a low carbon economy.

The abolition of Regional Strategies will provide a clear signal of the importance attached to the development and application of local spatial plans, in the form of Local Development Framework Core Strategies and other Development Plan Documents. Future reform in this area will make it easier for local councils, working with their communities, to agree and amend local plans in a way that maximises the involvement of neighbourhoods.

The abolition of Regional Strategies will require legislation in the ""Localism Bill"" which we are introducing this session. However, given the clear coalition commitment, it is important to avoid a period of uncertainty over planning policy, until the legislation is enacted. So I am revoking Regional Strategies today in order to give clarity to builders, developers and planners.

Regional Strategies are being revoked under s79(6) of the Local Democracy Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 and will thus no longer form part of the development plan for the purposes of s38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.

Revoking, and then abolishing, Regional Strategies will mean that the planning system is simpler, more efficient and easier for people to understand. It will be firmly rooted in the local community. And it will encourage the investment, economic growth and housing that Britain needs.

We will be providing advice for local planning authorities today and a copy has been placed in the library of the House.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,6-Jul-2010,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/2012952,Role of building societies,"* * *

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

Building societies occupy a unique space in national life.

You'll know the history much better than people outside this room, who might be surprised to learn you owe your origins to meeting in the back room of a Birmingham pub.

A group of working men all wanted to put a roof of their heads, who couldn't have hoped to on their own. But by pooling their savings, and working together, they were able to realise their ambitions.

Today, all of you in this room are inheritors of that remarkable heritage, working to a very distinctive ethos.

So I'm really pleased to have the chance to speak to you today.

### Challenges: Supply, Affordability

You will know better than anyone the scale and extent of the challenges in the housing market.

We have a challenge of Supply. In simple terms, we just aren't building enough homes. Analysis suggests that we are going to see two hundred and forty thousand new households formed every year over the coming decades. But when we came to power, we were building only half that.

The first challenge compounds the second - and that's affordability. House prices more than doubled in the decade to 2008, making it ever more expensive to get a foot on the ladder. Research suggests the vast majority of under 30s - some four in five - cannot afford to buy a home without help from the bank of mum and dad.

### Government's Role

This Government wants everyone to have not just a roof over their head, but a place they can be proud of. Whether they're owning, renting privately or in social housing.

I caused a bit of a storm last year when I said I want to see a more stable housing market, but we do - a more predictable market; with more new homes being built, and where it's easier for first-time buyers to get a foot on the ladder.

Now the Government does have some levers here.

  * Through the New Homes Bonus, we're rewarding those places that choose to grow. So councils and communities don't just feel the strain on existing services, but have real reasons to say ""yes"" to new homes.
  * We're giving people greater discretion than ever before to make sure that what gets built in their neighbourhood looks and feels right for their neighbourhood.
  * We've introduced ""Firstbuy"", a shared equity programme that will help some 15,000 first-time buyers get their feet on the ladder over the next two years.
  * And we're accelerating the release of public sector land for new development, which will have enough capacity to deliver up to 100,000 homes and support as many as 200,000 construction jobs by 2015.

We aim to publish a Housing Strategy next month. It will set out our next steps, and ambitions for the future, in all these areas and more, such as the new 'Right to Buy'.

As Housing Minister, I see it as my responsibility to swing the weight of Government behind efforts to get Britain building again.

### Lenders' Role

But I also realise that Government is not the be-all and the end-all. We will achieve more by working with you the market, together. And the actions of other organisations - especially lenders like you - are crucial.

The choices that lenders make and the products you offer can spell the difference between hopeful young families and heartbreak and frustration.

That's why I've already organised two summits for lenders, injecting some pace into the conversation about what more can be done to open up the market for first-time buyers.

Let me say that I'm very grateful to the Association and your members for the constructive spirit in which you took part in that work.

I know that some lenders are already thinking differently. About new models of finance, new methods of assessing risk and creditworthiness.

### Self Build

Take self-build. Your own research suggests that a good half of Britons would be keen to build their own home. Already, it's an industry many think of as small, but one actually worth some £3.6 billion each year.

But we're still at the bottom of the Self Build housing league. I want us to be at the top. That's why I'm working with the National Association of Self Builders to bring about a self-build revolution. Let's get rid of the barriers that stand in the way.

Now one of those barriers that won't surprise you is finance. Some lenders have laboured under the misperception that backing self-build is a risky proposition. But actually, figures from BuildStore show that of the 15,000 self-build projects started in the last 12 months, only 46 were repossessed. Lenders with an eye to the future will see that this is the time to get in on the ground floor.

I know there are 20 building societies who are up for it, and that's a tribute to their great good sense.

### Long-term Finance

Today, I want to suggest another area where changing lending practices could make a world of difference to first-time buyers: long-term fixed interest mortgages.

I like to think of them as ""peace of mind mortgages"". Every household has a job to do balancing their budgets. For parents, managing money sensibly is one of the most important things they can do to give their children the best start in life. And in today's uncertain world, their time has come again I think.

We also know that many people find it helpful to plan for the long term - knowing what future costs are going to be. It gives certainty and security, especially in turbulent times.  A sense of control.  There are products out there, in a range of different fields, to meet that demand.

  * For example - if you wanted to, you could get a fixed price on your gas bills until 2014.
  * You could go on line right now and get a quote for a five-year fixed-rate loan on a car.

But when it comes to mortgages - the single biggest outgoing for many families - does the market really cater to people who want long-term certainty?

Most fixed-rate deals are offered for somewhere between two and five years.

The longest fixed-rate terms currently available are 10 years.

And beyond 10 years - well, there's nothing.

Look at other countries - say Germany, or Scandinavia - and fixed-rate deals of 25 years are common.

Of course there are going to be costs and benefits for consumers to weigh up, and long-term fixes won't be for everyone. And I'm not proposing in any way that they should be.

For some, though, the peace of mind of knowing exactly how much they'll have going out of their account each month could be what gives them the confidence to buy.

This could help bring new investors who need long term stable returns into the market, increasing the funds available for lending overall.  
     
So I think there may be a gap in the market here. It would be a canny lender who decided to test this market. To gauge demand.

As building societies, you have innovation in your genes. You owe your origins to a group of people who just weren't satisfied with what the market offered them at the time.

**Conclusion**

So I look forward to discussing this idea with you today - and what more you and the Government can do to unlock the housing market:

  * To get builders working at full speed again.
  * To get families into new homes.
  * To help people achieve their aspirations. Not just a roof over their head, but a home in which they can really take pride.

So let's talk.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"Savoy Place, London",,,,20-Oct-2011,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

> ""Planning policy and practice is of pivotal importance to our future.""

I'm grateful for the opportunity to talk to so many members of the RTPI.

I am absolutely thrilled to have responsibility for planning policy as part of a wider brief to decentralise power from central government to local people.

Planning policy and practice is of pivotal importance to our future.

Many people in public service can change people's lives in the course of their work - be that through health, education or the social services.

But everyone in this room shapes the world in which new generations live and work - and makes it better than it would otherwise be. The places where children grow up, that will stay with them forever. The workplaces where thousands of people spend thousands of daylight hours. The places we look forward to going home to in the evening.

It is, when you think about it, an awesome responsibility, and I feel privileged to be here.

I want to use this occasion to talk about two things: decentralisation and development.

I believe in them both.

And I believe that they can and should reinforce one another.

Here is an example of what I mean. From my desk I look at this print of Tunbridge Wells, at the heart of the constituency I represent in Parliament.

You might expect a community like this to have a history stretching back to medieval times. In fact, it is a creation of the early modern age.

This print - the first made of the town - was created in 1719, barely one hundred years after the spring that was the town's raison d'etre was discovered.

By that time they'd already built a colonnade of coffee houses and shops to service visitors to the wells; a chapel to attend to the spiritual needs of the revellers; and various lodging houses to accommodate them.

Carefully laid out on previously empty heath land, you could call Tunbridge Wells the oldest new town in the country.

There wasn't much of a planning system in those days, of course, let alone one controlled by central government.

And yet our forbears not only built the towns and cities in which we live today, but did so with enthusiasm.

Modern conditions obviously demand a modern planning system. But what we need to restore is the sense of local initiative that once drove our country forward.

The old association between development and opportunity seems to have broken down.

Everyone in this room must have experienced the growth of public hostility not just to new developments, but to the very idea that new development can be a change for the better.

We've almost got to the point where any new building project is assumed by default to be negative - something that will destroy, rather than create beauty, that will impair rather than enhance, that will make life worse rather than better.

What a disastrous situation to be in.

The aspects of our world that are built by man have been, and are, our most thrilling achievements.

Why do people cross oceans to experience the Manhattan skyline or the view from Westminster Bridge, and yet regard most future development with dread and foreboding?

I want to get back to a world in which development not only delivers on our practical requirements, but is also seen as an exciting and positive force in all of our lives.

The current planning system has been partly responsible for creating this atmosphere. Even my predecessor John Healey wrote to us this week and said of the planning system ""ours was too top down"".

He's right. The top-down planning model of housing numbers imposed through Regional Spatial Strategies has been very good at generating impressive-sounding numbers, but very bad at turning them into homes.

As you know, last year saw the lowest number of housing completions since 1946, and while the recession clearly had an impact, we are a world away from having created a system in which enough houses are built.

The regional numbers have provoked bitter resistance, which is one of the reasons why only 17 per cent of authorities - 58 out of 336 - have adopted core planning strategies six years after they were introduced.

So when the RTPI manifesto at the last election said that the current planning regime is ""largely fit for purpose - it does not need radical overhaul"", I respectfully disagree.

I completely understand the thinking behind the previous model. It was characteristic of previous approaches to Government - and I don't mean it unkindly.

The old view was that the best way to solve problems - whether in schools, health, local government or planning - was for good, serious people to sit down and work out what is the best template to achieve collective goals, to codify it, and roll that out across the country requiring others to implement it.

The idea was that this would lift up the under-performers to a dramatically higher standard and so improve social welfare.

The trouble is that people, at least in this country, tend not to fall into line with this approach.

They bridle at imposition from afar, however well-intentioned, and will expend considerable effort and ingenuity in resisting it.

It requires a bureaucracy of enforcement which becomes divisive and adversarial and costly as well as entailing uncertainty and delay.

More than that, it doesn't accord with the real life experience that people are at their best when they can exercise their own talents and judgement - in which local initiative can flourish.

That's why our approach is built on empowering, rather than disempowering, people and communities.

I can understand why supporters of localism would want to put our commitment to the test. Past experience has taught them that politicians are localists in opposition and centralists in government.

Looking back across the years you will have seen ministers standing before meetings like this, promising to give power away, but never quite getting round to it. So why should this time be different?

Five reasons:

  * firstly, because the Prime Minister has made decentralisation not just _a_ theme of his government, but _the_ theme - in the form of the Big Society
  * secondly, the Big Society forms the basis of the coalition, with a common commitment to localism forming the tightest bond between the two parties
  * thirdly, in the substantial shape of Eric Pickles, localism has a true champion around the Cabinet table
  * fourthly we're already getting on with the job. We've ended HIPs, cut ring fencing of grants to local authorities, ended CAA and announced the abolition of the regional quangos
  * fifthly, as announced in the Queen's Speech, we will shortly introduce the Decentralisation and Localism Bill. This will be a landmark piece of legislation. Indeed, I challenge anyone to find anything on the statute book that transfers more power from central to local government than is the case with this Bill.

For all of these reasons I can say with some confidence that this is the localist moment, the greatest opportunity for decentralisation in decades.

So what are the key elements of the reforms we want to bring about?

The first is that decisions should be taken at the most local level possible, and by people who are accountable to the public.

That is why we have moved quickly to return to local planning authorities the ability to make a free choice of whether garden land should be developed or not. And of what densities housing should be built at. It is not for central government to mandate a requirement to progressively eradicate the character of our towns and suburbs when this is a matter in which local people, rightly, have an informed view.

It is why we will end regional spatial strategies which embodied the worst type of imposition by bodies with no democratic credibility and accountability, alienating people from a sense of control over their own environment.

And that is why local planning remains important, with local councils and communities collaborating and setting out their visions and plans.

But when I say decisions should be taken at as local a level as possible that is not to say that everything should be at the level of planning committee of one local authority. Neighbouring authorities will have many issues on which they can and should collaborate, and they will have a duty to do so.

For instance, the regeneration of the Thames Gateway provides London, Essex, Kent, Thurrock and Medway with a compelling reason to work together to agree common spatial policies. Which, of course, they wouldn't if they stuck to either their local, or regional, boundaries.

And there is an important role for national policy. Nowhere is this more important than in the field of major infrastructure projects.

We agree with the previous Government that there should be a fast-track, streamlined planning process for projects of national significance.

However, we don't believe that the solution arrived at embodies enough democratic accountability. That's why we will proceed with the designation of the National Policy Statements, but make them subject to ratification by Parliament. Apart from the proper democratic accountability it entails, it will make the NPSs better proofed against successful judicial review.

Similarly, we believe that final decisions should be taken by a Minister, not an unelected official, but subject to the same time frame, and advised by a similar process as under the IPC.

Finally, at a time when we wish to reduce the number of quangos, we believe that the functions of the IPC are best accommodated as a distinct Major Infrastructure Planning Unit within the Planning Inspectorate, reporting directly to Ministers.

The second element to the reforms we are making is to ensure there are powerful incentives to local communities that engage in development - whether for housing or commercial development.

It is unsurprising that enthusiasm for development is often lacking in local communities when, to set against what they may perceive as the risk of new development, there are scarcely any financial returns to the neighbourhood and the wider community. Too often they are hoovered up by central government, disempowering and disincentivising local communities.

One of the principal sources of doubt about localism is not over the willingness of central government to give power away, but whether local communities are willing or able to deal with the responsibility that freedom brings.

Much of it, I'm afraid to say, is rooted in a certain metropolitan bias. As if talent and dedication can only reside at the centre.

Yet it is worth reminding ourselves that the record of central government over the last decade or so has been less than stellar.

Despite all the power and money at its disposal, the centre did not deliver. Public sector productivity has fallen, social mobility has stagnated, inequality has increased and all of our futures are mired in debt.

And what of planning policy? Our national infrastructure has not kept pace with the demands of the 21st century. Basic housing needs have not been met.

No-one is claiming that local government is perfect. But to justify decentralisation it doesn't have to be. It just needs to be as good as central government, which isn't a particularly high bar.

And what of the charge that nimbyism will act as a permanent brake to development? I'm afraid I see metropolitan snobbery at work here.

In particular the semi-inverted snobbery aimed at the leafy suburbs and market towns of middle England. Here, supposedly, is the seat of stagnation.

The strongholds of small-mindedness that would preserve themselves in aspic, given half a chance.

Except something doesn't quite add up.

Consider for instance, the matter of constituency boundaries.

In theory, each constituency should have an equal number of electors.

In practice, rural and suburban seats tend to have more than urban constituencies.

This is because the boundary commissions struggle to keep up with population movements.

And what these movements typically show is a shift from the cities to those leafier areas that are supposedly so resistant to change and development.

Yet in the last 2 decades of the last century, the population of South East England expanded by 10 per cent - twice the national average. In the last 25 years there has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of households in the South east.

Far from stagnating, these communities are flourishing.

Indeed, I believe that the instinct to flourish is present in all our communities - even if it has been suppressed more in some than in others.

It is, for instance, an instinct that can be seen in the municipal traditions of our great cities - each of which has a history of striving not merely for growth, but for greatness.

That vision is still alive today.

I believe that when people enter public life, wanting to make a difference, the dreams that they have are of their own communities.

Their ambitions may be for the nation as whole, but when they envision change, it is familiar people and places that they see in their mind's eye.

We need to put this vision back into the public view of planning and development.

Over the coming year we will redesign with the policy framework with this objective.

By moving from conflict to collaboration, we can be both pro-development and pro-localist.

By rethinking some of our basic assumptions we can create a planning system fit for the Big Society.

I hope that expert bodies like the RTPI will regard this as an opportunity.

Indeed, as the opportunity of a lifetime.

For the first time we have a Government that not only has been elected with localism as its touchstone policy, but which has the mandate that comes from a clear majority of both the seats and the votes.

I want nothing less than to see a return to the idea that has driven the success of this body that planners, and the planning process, are one of the principal motors of progressive change in our country.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,"Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London",,,,29-Jun-2010,making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

Thanks Sarah [Webb] and thank you for introducing me to the PACT.

I'll study it carefully as I know it's full of some really great ideas.

So... Another year, another housing Minister. At least this time the electorate had something to do with it!

During that recent election you had to listen to politicians putting forward their ideas - you may have got fed up listening to us.

You might think politicians talk too much and don't listen enough.

So I want to use most of this session to hear from you.

### Decentralisation

But first, I think it's fair to say that there has been a long tradition of Housing Ministers coming to CIH only to find that they've been moved on by the following year's conference.

If a week's a long time in politics, then a year has proved an eternity for recent Housing Ministers.

So you've seen a lot of them coming and going and each reshuffled Minister tells you about:

  * the new targets that have to be reached,
  * the way that money has to be spent,
  * and the latest pet project to come out of Whitehall.

I've shadowed these Ministers as they've been pulling levers, pushing buttons and blowing whistles... to no effect.

And I've waited impatiently to be here.

So what do I want to do now I have my hands on those levers?

That's simple.

I want to hand them over to you.

Whether you work in Local Government.

Whether you work for a housing association or are a builder.

Whether you are a landlord, tenant, or homeowner.

Whether you are a member of a housing co-op or want to set up a community land trust.

I want you to have the power to make the decisions you know are right for your local community.

Why? Because I believe that the more I let go of power the more you can achieve.

Politicians and Governments do not have all the answers. So instead I am going to place my faith in you.

When I became Housing Minister, I may have had three years more housing experience than most of the recent lot, but I don't have as much experience as you!

The combined knowledge at this conference far outweighs mine - there are 1,000 delegates here today. Let's say you have an average of 10 years experience in housing - and maybe that's an underestimate - so multiply that out and you've got 10,000 years of valuable housing expertise.

So I think we need to listen to you.

The old assumption that Whitehall knows best... and that Ministers knew even better was wrong.

  * Targets haven't worked,
  * restrictive regulations haven't worked,
  * and simply spending money on too many initiatives hasn't worked.

So I see my job as setting the framework for you to achieve the changes you want to see. Whether that's providing more homes or helping tenants have a stronger voice.

### Tenants' power

And we need to give people the platform to get things done.

When tenants are dissatisfied with the service, they need to see things change.

I have some ideas about how this can be done. They are not fixed in stone and I want to discuss them more with you.

But here are some thoughts.

There could be Tenants' Panels that genuinely help tenants have a stronger voice in their local community.

How about if tenants could complain to their panel? And what if those panels had real teeth to intervene?

Then, along with elected Councillors and MPs, tenants' panels could act as a new gateway to the Ombudsman.

Elected representatives would know which landlords provide the best service to their tenants.

Landlords would become more responsive and locally accountable. 

And when councillors consider new planning applications for affordable housing in their area, they could easily take the landlord's record into account when selecting their Social Landlord partner.

So producing better and more responsible landlords wouldn't be the product of some large national quango... Nor targets... Nor additional standards...

But rather a natural response to a system which properly puts tenants and their representatives firmly in the driving seat for the very first time.

These are my ideas - and that's what I call real tenant empowerment.

### TSA and the HCA

In fact... I place huge premium on tenant empowerment - but I'm far from convinced that a large national quango is the best way to do it.

It's also no secret that I have been concerned for some time about whether the Tenants Services Authority offers value for money.

To give one specific example, this quango spent close to £100,000 on lobbyists to lobby - amongst others... the Government. And that seems frankly ill-judged.

Therefore I can confirm today that Government is reviewing the role and purpose of the Tenants Services Authority and the best framework for regulating social housing. This will consider the full range of options in line with our commitment to reduce the number and cost of quangos.

I believe that we can cut out unnecessary inspection - decentralise power... reduce bureaucracy... and save money.

But I want to reassure you that Government absolutely recognises the value of independent economic regulation of social housing.

This is why I intend to ensure that economic regulation continues to enable housing associations to secure significant private investment into affordable housing.

I can also confirm that the Homes and Communities Agency will stay. But I think it needs to operate in a genuinely local way - at the invitation of local people who want to improve their communities.

So it will be smaller, more strategic - with the HCA's functions being delivered under local leadership.

It will be much leaner.

To use the jargon I see it as an enabling and investment body. Or in plain English, the people who help to get things done.

### Budget

And getting things done will be harder in these tough economic times. There will be difficult decisions. The Budget made that clear.

When the country has been living beyond its means I am not going to stand here and promise what can't be delivered.

But things will still get done... yes it will be tough but the sky will not fall in.

We'll need to get smarter about using the resources we do have. Incentivising rather than directing - working with the grain of human nature.

So for example rather than Whitehall telling communities how many homes they need, communities will drive that investment through responding to incentives and will feel the benefit of new homes being built in their area.

### Devolving power - Conclusion

And this is an important point. We are not reducing expenditure just to save money, although the fiscal deficit is huge.

As the Chancellor said on Tuesday, the Coalition believes in a smaller state and a bigger society.

So we must do things differently.

Stop setting up quangos.

Stop burning cash on consultants.

Stop putting our faith in expensive IT systems that don't actually work.

Stop using public money to pay people in the public, charitable and voluntary sector more than the Prime Minister earns.

Instead we will trust you.

Over the last few years many of you have spoken to me, with passion, about the plans that you have.

The changes you wanted to see.

Now I want to give you the power to make those plans real.

So my PACT with you is that I will be handing over power and control to make those changes happen.

I know you will succeed.

Thank you.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"Housing 2010 Conference and Exhibition, Harrogate International Centre",,,,24-Jun-2010,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,improving-the-rented-housing-sector,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/1875445,Sustainable Communities Act,"* * *

I have today launched a consultation on new, light-touch, regulations to govern the implementation of the Sustainable Communities Act 2007.

On 15 December 2010, the Secretary of State invited local authorities to consult their communities about how best to improve their local areas, and to take whatever action was necessary to make these ideas a reality. If councils find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action they can submit a formal 'proposal' asking Government to remove the barrier. There is now an easy route to do this - through the new online portal at [barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the Government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action.

I want to remove the bureaucracy that surrounded the first invitation under the Act. I do not intend to regulate the actions of local authorities who wish to respond to the invitation, nor to regulate the duties of the Selector - the Local Government Association, who in the past has had to shortlist proposals and engage in lengthy consultation with government about their implementation. Councils will no longer be required to take specific steps before submitting a proposal, or to submit proposals to a set deadline. We are turning government upside down to provide a much more direct and personal service dedicated to removing as many barriers to localism as possible.

There may be times, however, when a council which has submitted a proposal under the Act is dissatisfied with the reasons given by Government about why a particular barrier cannot be removed. I intend, therefore, to set out in regulations a clear role for the Selector to provide challenge to government in such cases. The Selector will be able to re-submit a proposal with a requirement for the Secretary of State to consult, and try to reach agreement with them prior to reaching a final decision.

The consultation on the proposed regulations closes on 20 June 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2019515,Technical reforms of Council Tax: consultation,"* * *

I am today publishing a consultation paper entitled _Technical Reforms of Council Tax_. It follows, in part, from the Local Government Resource Review's commitment to consider what flexibilities local authorities should have to help keep overall council tax levels down. It discusses a series of practical proposals which will help hard-working families and pensioners with their council tax bills.

Its proposals for discussion include:

  * Giving councils the flexibility to reduce or remove council tax relief on second homes and empty homes, allowing councils to use the money to keep overall council tax bills down and/or spend on improving frontline services. These flexibilities would potentially allow for a £20 reduction in the bill for a typical Band D property in England. Getting empty homes back into use will increase housing supply and tackle property blight. Councils can already reduce the second homes discount to just 10 per cent - we propose giving councils the local discretion to charge the normal rate of council tax. The job-related second homes discount (where someone has to live in a dwelling because of their job) would be unaffected. Indeed, our Government has increased the help the Armed Forces scheme gives for service personnel towards council tax. There is nothing morally wrong with second homes, but special tax relief at the expense of ordinary homeowners is difficult to justify. I believe local taxpayers would welcome the prospect of having a lower council tax bill than would otherwise be the case as a result of empty homes no longer being given favoured tax treatment.
  * The paper also consults on the empty homes premium for long-term properties announced by Ministers in September. I would note that there are no plans to change the rules on council tax relief currently available in respect of properties left empty because a person has moved into a hospital or care home, has died, or has moved to provide care to another. These are special circumstances. Moreover, councils will be encouraged to use their existing powers to apply discretionary discounts in cases where homes are empty due to other justifiable circumstances - for example, hardship, fire or flooding.
  * Giving local residents a new right to pay their council tax bills in 12 monthly payments, rather than 10 instalments over a year. This will make it easier for local taxpayers to manage their payments, especially those on fixed incomes like pensioners.
  * Encouraging the greater use of electronic billing by allowing the associated documents that have to be supplied in hard copy with council tax bills to be provided electronically instead. Local taxpayers would still have a right to hard copy documents, for free, on request. Utility companies routinely offer discounts for customers who pay by e-billing and direct debit, and this is something I am keen to promote for council tax.
  * Ensuring there are no increases in the tax liabilities of homes as a result of domestic scale photovoltaic solar panels being installed by a third party supplier under a 'rent a roof' scheme. These changes will avoid the imposition of a 'sun tax' and the need for inspections of homes with solar panels.

Reviewing the circumstances in which giving a self-contained ('granny') annex its own council tax liability and banding is appropriate; this is a very complex area of legislation, but I appreciate that there has been some public concern that the current regime is unfair on some homeowners.

These practical improvements complement our other reforms to council tax: cancelling the council tax revaluation which would have forced up bills for millions of homes; working with local councils to deliver a two-year council tax freeze; and giving local residents a new right to veto excessive council tax increases. It contrasts with the last Administration who doubled council tax.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

I am delighted to address this year's Thames Gateway Forum. I am particularly pleased to speak to you because, as some of you will know, I am not just the Minister for the Thames Gateway, but more or less a product of the Thames Gateway. I was born and grew up in Hornchurch; served as a councillor in Havering; represented Bexley on the Greater London Assembly; and am now Member of Parliament for Bromley and Chislehurst - Thames Gateway's next door neighbour. To these credentials I can add, if needed, that my wife Daphne was until May a councillor in Southend and a former mayor of the town. So I know the Thames Gateway very well.

And I know that rumours of its demise are somewhat wide of the mark!

#### Time to decentralise

I am here to confirm that the coalition government is dedicated to playing its part in making the Thames Gateway the success it deserves to be. But we do believe the best way forward is to hand over the reins to local people, who are more than capable of leading themselves.

Decisions about the Thames Gateway shouldn't be taken in Whitehall. They should be taken in the area, by the people who know the area. So we won't issue more blueprints from Whitehall. We won't be setting impressive-sounding but unrealistic targets either.

Instead, we're putting power back in the hands of local people and their representatives - the people you've heard from this morning.

And the Thames Gateway is at the heart of plans for the local enterprise partnership in Kent, Essex and East Sussex, and the equivalent in London Thames Gateway. The glue will be provided by the new Thames Gateway Strategic Group, simplifying the plethora of bodies we have had up to now. The partnership and Group have much on which to build.

#### Olympics and their legacy

Pride of place must go to the Olympic and Paralympics games, which the whole of the Thames Gateway hosts in 2012. This is your opportunity to showcase East London and the rest of the Thames Gateway not just as a place for play, not just for a great sporting spectacular, but as a place in which to invest. Government will support that at home and abroad, and I know that you will lead the drive to bring new businesses to this part of Britain. The likes of DP World - literally building a bit more of Essex - Ikea, Westfield and Cemex already know its advantages, as do the Stobart Group  -  who are expanding Southend Airport in readiness for London 2012.

The Games themselves will be an inspiration, but the legacy they leave will be the measure of their success. That's why, despite the current economic climate, the government has secured in the spending review half a billion pounds to transform the Games' venues and park into a whole new district of London as well as improvements to public space in the host Boroughs. And the government is giving the Mayor of London powers which he intends to use to create a development corporation centred on the Olympic park to secure a lasting legacy from the Games.

#### Crossrail

And we won't forget about the Thames Gateway after the Games. That's why, in the Spending Review, we gave the go-ahead for Crossrail's original plans - an investment worth £14.5bn to business and residents.

We have had tough choices to make about prioritising how we spend taxpayers' money. But we know how important it is for Thames Gateway residents and businesses to be better connected with the rest of London.

The five new stations in the Thames Gateway - combined with improvements to the Docklands Light Railway and the London Overground - mean residents and businesses of East and South East London will be better served by public transport than ever before.

It will mean that:

  * The business district of Canary Wharf can expand;
  * Stratford will flourish;
  * The world class international conference centre at Excel can grow;
  * We can open up the untapped potential of the Royal Docks where there is 300 acres of land still to be developed;
  * There will be a vital connection south of the river at Abbey Wood.

#### Wider infrastructure

On the roads, we know that there is congestion in some places, at junction 30 of the M25 and at the Dartford Crossing. The Department for Transport is to review the options for a second crossing, funded by charges, between South Essex and North Kent.

Funding is, though, as we all know tight. We have faced difficult choices, and during this government's review of the Kent Thameside Strategic Transport Programme, it has become clear that home building will be slower than originally anticipated. My officials will thoroughly review the scheme with local partners and reach across government to bust the barriers which currently stand between the people of North Kent and the infrastructure they need.

Meantime, I am pleased to see that the Mayor will provide the first cross river cable car connecting Custom House and the O2. This is an exciting new way to span the Thames which will be a boost to tourism as well as being a practical solution for local people. I look forward to my first ride across!

#### Job growth

Of course, what any area really needs is jobs. And the infrastructure we're supporting will help the Thames Gateway expand into new sectors. That's why the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation has been investing in infrastructure at the Sustainable Industries Park, Dagenham.

The roll-call of firms - Thames Gateway Power, Paper Round and Closed Loop - wanting to locate or expand there is truly impressive, and provides the foundation for green technology which will become the backbone of the Thames Gateway.

I am thrilled too that, in this world-leading home for the creative and cultural industries, the first phase of the £60m High House Production Park in Purfleet backed by the Royal Opera House, will officially open on 6 December 2010. The opening is supported by one thousand people from the local community, a Big Society if ever I saw one. I hope to attend myself.

And Ravensbourne, formerly in my own constituency but recently moved to the O2, is now home to the future stars of digital media and design. The talent it will foster will ensure the Thames Gateway establishes its reputation as one of the best places in the world for creativity and innovation.

#### Peroration

All this points to a vibrant future for the Thames Gateway:

  * It is open for business
  * It is an exciting place to live
  * It is an inspiring place to visit.

In the hands of the communities of the Thames Gateway it will be better off:

  * There will be more jobs
  * Better transport, and
  * Higher skills.

The government will play its part, being a full partner in making this a reality. We will work tirelessly on the Thames Gateway's behalf - promoting it at home and abroad, making a success of the Olympics and infrastructure schemes like Crossrail, and providing the people and places of the Thames Gateway with the tools they need to make it a success. But it is your Thames Gateway: its future lies in your hands. Let's work together in the years ahead to continue its success.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,"The East Wintergarden, London",,,,25-Nov-2010,,,,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

### Introduction

It's been a busy morning.

They say a week is a long time in politics and it's a lesson I've learnt in recent weeks.

And it's hard to believe that it's almost five years since I took on the housing brief, first in opposition and now in Government.

The experience has given me a few insights into this great industry which I thought would be worth sharing today.

### The housing paradox

But, first, let me start with a paradox.

In the last decade we built too few homes, far fewer than needed.

House prices soared but, by 2009, house building had fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s.

The noughties was a decade of, I think, missed opportunities.

It wasn't as if nobody wanted new homes.

You couldn't turn the telly on without seeing another house related programme: _Changing Rooms_, _Grand Designs_, _The Restoration Man_.

Yet the housing market had ground to a halt.

And I think the problem was clear. Buyers certainly weren't to blame. It was the system.

You could see the system at work, or perhaps I should say failing to work, in any one of those TV property programmes.

The red tape your sector had to cut its way through. The endless regulations. The interminable delays.

The energy, enthusiasm, determination - dissipated. Willingness to stake out the new property frontiers - simply frustrated.

It was enough to stir up the inner builder in any of us.

Trouble was, in the past, the centre talked a good game but did very little to change the environment.

### Building more houses

Now our solution to this housing problem is simple - we're going to get out there and build more houses. Not talk about it. But actually do it.

We've learnt the lessons of the past.

I know Government alone won't get the market started.

So this will be a team effort.

The NewBuy Guarantee Scheme we've just been talking about I think is a case in point.

We're giving up to 100,000 prospective buyers up to 95 per cent loan to value mortgage to purchase new build properties.

It's a great idea. And I know you agree. Because you came up with the idea.

Now we're determined to let you get on with it.

No builders are excluded from NewBuy by design and we won't intervene in the commercial arrangements of builders and lenders.

With more lenders and builders coming on board, customers will have a wide range of options to choose from when buying their newly-built home.

Just yesterday, in Cambridgeshire, we welcomed the very first buyer to purchase a home through the NewBuy guarantee scheme.

### A boxed in generation

Now NewBuy can also help a group of people who've often been overlooked.

Traditionally the political debate has focused on the people at the very bottom of the pile and the people at the very top.

But what about those stuck in between?

Those who slip, not so much under the radar, as between it.

Second generation buyers in flats or houses which they have actually grown.

Almost everyone knows someone in that position.

A hardworking person who bought their own home when they were single, maybe met someone, fell in love, and now have a couple of kids.

They expected to trade up.

That's what every parent would have done after all.

But now they're boxed in.

Home outgrown.

They don't have cash to pay for a mortgage three or four times their own salary. Let alone 10 or 20 times.

They face the prospect of being boxed in, in their homes, for up to 25 years or more.

According to HSBC research, of the 360,000 homeowners who bought their first property in 2007, many are trapped in their first home and unable to move up the property ladder.

What does it say about our system that we've a generation who feel forgotten?

That nearly a third of parents feel boxed in their homes, unable to live comfortably in a home too small for the needs of their family.

That their children will have moved on before they've managed to move out.

We don't want Britain to be a place of housing have nots.

We want people to have room to grow.

So the NewBuy Guarantee gives second time buyers a second chance.

The boxed in family now gets help.

Help to buy a new build home with the ceiling price set up to a half a million pounds.

So well done.

You're thinking outside the box.

Rolling back the housing frontier.

And we're keen to work with the industry in other ways as well.

The lack of sufficient land to build new homes is an enormous drag on housing growth.

So we're accelerating the release of brownfield Government-owned land to deliver more than 100,000 additional homes.

### Working with local authorities

And Government isn't just working with builders but with local authorities.

Our new Homes Bonus incentivises local authorities to increase their housing stock, bringing more houses back into use, and raising the bar for affordable homes.

Second year payments are going out now and we're starting to see change on the ground.

When they build extra homes, authorities will now get a bonus to take the strain on their services and infrastructure.

Now these changes will make it easier for communities to accept new housing. As will our plans to improve neighbourhood design.

I want to say more on that in a moment.

### Working with communities

Besides local authorities we're working with communities.

Neighbourhood Planning and the Community Right to Buy will help communities deliver the development that they need.

Now it's 30 years on from the introduction of Right to Buy. And council tenants are increasingly able to use that purchsing power again.

With a maximum discount now at £75,000 across the country - quadrupling the potential amount available in London and trebling it elsewhere.

With the proceeds, unlike the initial buy, going to build new homes for affordable rent.

### Collaboration - the industry and communities

But this isn't just about Government.

About them and us.

It's about you.

I want to see the house building industry working hand in glove with local communities.

I know you feel frustrated waiting for the planning green light.

Shovels poised.

Diggers at the ready.

Weeks slowly turning into months.

So we're helping remedy this situation by providing you with a 12 month planning decision guarantee.

I know this is something you'll welcome.

But in return there's something you can do to help us.

You see part of the trouble is local communities sometimes see the plan at the last minute.

It takes them time to get their heads round what's proposed.

So, in the National Planning Policy Framework, we're requiring you to consult earlier.

And we're asking you to think about design.

Now Britain is great at building.

Just a short walk from here is the magnificent Derby House designed by Robert Adam. One of many examples of Britain's fantastic building heritage.

But if we want great neighbourhoods as well as great buildings we need great designs in order to take our communities with them.

Down in Devon they've got the right idea.

Local Totnes residents opposed the developer's original proposal for a mixed-use residential development on the edge of town.

But working together the council, residents and the local architect devised a fitting alternative.

The door to planning permission was flung open, houses delivered and in hot demand from local buyers.

The lesson is absolutely clear. Great design helps communities accept your work and speed up the system.

Later this year, I'll be setting out plans to give communities a greater voice and encourage joint working at a Government/Industry Design Summit.

I hope many of you will be involved.

### Conclusion

So I've given you a flavour of what we're doing together to build more homes.

We're already turning things around.

Since 2009 starts are up by 24 per cent.

New housing output is up by 33 per cent.

And new orders up by 35 per cent.

We're unfreezing the system. But we need you to go even further, faster.

To work with communities to design sustainable local schemes.

To react speedily when freed up land becomes available.

To tell us what else we can do to help, to rip away that red tape.

To usher in a new age of housing.

An age of magnificent homes to match our ambition.

An age that gives a boxed in community, a boxed in generation, finally room to grow once again.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"Marriott Grosvenor Square Hotel, London",,,,24-Apr-2012,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

I'm very pleased to be here today at the CIPFA conference.

We already reached a100 days of the coalition. Hard to believe how fast time flies when you're busy. Over that period, the Government has demonstrated its determination to get public finances back into good shape.

At CLG we've done a lot too. Scrapped HIPs and housing targets to free the housing market. Set about replacing RDAs with local enterprise partnerships to reopen the country for business. Stopped the bureaucratic reorganisation of Devon and Norwich councils and those unfair bin and port taxes.

And we are putting councils and communities back in control of their own destinies.

Of course, the actions we have taken so far are just the start. And there will be more difficult decisions ahead because that economic situation.

### Funding, Emergency Budget

The most urgent issue facing the country is the need to reduce the deficit, put finances back on a stable footing and ensure economic recovery.

Today I want to talk about how we make those necessary decisions together.

The reductions announced in the Emergency Budget made clear our resolve to reduce spending whilst minimising the impact on essential frontline services.

This included steps to limit the impact on local authorities and make savings proportionate.

To help cope we are transferring more power to councils that will mean more local decisions can be made with greater local flexibility.

Many councils are already taking steps to make their own efficiencies through innovative and effective working. I want to see more - sharing management, expertise and resources.

Not only can this save money, but it can support local priorities and can also deliver better access to good legal advice, or better careers for employees.

### Spending Review/Efficiencies

The Spending Review will establish Government's long term plans for public spending, and our expectation about the level of savings that the public sector can make.

But we are embedding our new politics by working in an open, transparent and collaborative way.

The Chancellor recently met with local government to discuss how we can increase productivity by reducing unnecessary waste and costs on things like reporting to Whitehall and the ring-fencing of grants.

We are committed to a phasing out more ring-fenced budgets. We have already cut the centrally-imposed burdens on local government like the Comprehensive Area Assessment and will cut local government inspection further across Whitehall.

We are engaging and involving the whole country in the difficult decisions that will be needed through the Treasury's Spending Challenge.

The Spending Review will drive decentralisation across all areas that fund local government.

Departments are considering issues beyond their traditional remits including those that cross administrative boundaries.

### Future of Local Audit

For example last month Eric Pickles announced plans to disband the Audit Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

However, independent audit of public bodies remains absolutely critical - we are disbanding the organisation, not the requirement for an annual audit of accounts. That will continue.

The Audit Commission has helped raise the standard of local authority financial management. It had early success in rooting out scandals.

But times have changed. Increasingly it has become an agent of central bureaucracy reporting to Whitehall.

It was behaving as a large corporate but it's in the public sector, and in the current circumstances that's really not acceptable. By stripping out those corporate costs we can save the public purse about £50 million.

Let me be clear - no-one questions the quality of the in-house audit practice. It did, does, and can continue to do a good job.

The audit function can be carried out perfectly sensibly by being moved to the private sector. It is something which they were going to do themselves and is not in dispute.

We do question why the Government runs the fifth largest audit firm. We do question why councils pay inflated fees to support a central commission reporting to Government that we don't believe we need.

We believe we should trust councils to make independent audit appointments and trust local people to hold councils to account.

### Transparency

It is vital that we all look at where every penny is spent and that citizens are engaged in making these decisions.

Whilst councils have already delivered significant efficiencies, there is still waste to be driven out - greater transparency and accountability will help identify this potential.

This is why we want all spending over £500 published online by January.

It will root out overspends, mistakes and waste that could save millions.

The public are saying ""show me the money"". CLG has already done. The LGA are going to. And 45 councils are already setting the example too.

### Localism

We want to help local people hold councils to account for local spending decisions. Localism is central to our thinking.

By shifting power and funding to the most appropriate local level, communities and councils can take more responsibility for local spending decisions.

This will increase the accountability to citizens and lift the centrally-imposed bureaucratic burden which has emerged over the last few years.

By asking councils to publish online we can have a more open form of local government that answers to the public not Whitehall.

Localism will help local authorities to make the savings necessary to live within the fiscal constraints facing us all free from central government interference.

Government's role is in the opening up of public services so they can be locally-driven services and meet local needs.

### Big Society

What is clear is that we need a radically different approach - which is where the Big Society comes in.

Big Society is about fundamentally changing the way Government and citizens interact where individuals and communities have more power and responsibility and use it to create better neighbourhoods and local services.

In July, the Prime Minister launched four vanguard areas where local people are taking the lead, and taking on responsibility for shaping the decisions that affect their local area.

They are helping to build the Big Society.

And will pursue their projects, taking on a blend of powers and responsibilities they need.

The Big Society is about turning government on its head.

We will get out of the way of citizens and neighbourhoods by helping people to bulldoze the barricades and get rid of the regulations and red tape that gets in their way.

### Localism Bill

Our Localism Bill will help set the foundations for the Big Society.

It will radically transform the relationships between central government, local government, communities and individuals.

It will devolve greater powers to local authorities and neighbourhoods to give local communities more control over decisions that impact on their local area, like housing and planning.

It will give communities better opportunities to bid to run state services and take over local assets. It will unleash the voluntary and community sector. We want:

  * to make it easier to set up and run a co-operative, mutual or social enterprise
  * to get more resources into the sector through the Big Society Bank, and opportunities to take over services and assets
  * and to make it easier for voluntary and community sector organisations to run public services.

Local people will have more power over how local government spends public money, ensuring that councillors are more directly accountable to them.

And it will free local authorities from central and regional control, so that they can ensure services are delivered according to local needs.

### Local Government Action

Of course, local government and its partners have a vital role in identifying the areas where working together - and working differently - can reduce unnecessary costs and focus resources on where they make the biggest difference.

Incremental changes won't be enough. Councils will need to think about how they work with delivery partners to radically reconfigure services.

Councils will need to take a twin track approach - identifying and delivering quick wins to create space to deliver longer-term transformational change.

I don't for a minute believe that this will be automatically painless. But the sector recognises that there are savings to made to focus resources on the front line through better procurement, greater collaboration and sharing of services.

A few weeks ago I went to Dartford to see how the council went about keeping its weekly bin collection. First it asked the public who voted overwhelming (94.5 per cent) in favour of weekly collections. Then they looked at how they could afford it and developed a plan to share some services with Sevenoaks to cover the cost. Sounds simple but I can't think of a better example of cost saving to maintain a frontline service resident want.

Other councils are thinking innovatively too. Already there are 11 shared chiefs in place and twenty other district councils are discussing whether to share their chief executive and senior management teams.

Leicestershire and Melton are planning to share offices. West Oxfordshire and Cotswold District Councils have agreed to share a Chief Executive and other key posts.

Holland and Breckland district councils are poised to establish the first cross-county shared chief executive post between two authorities that do not share a border.

Their savings are expected to be around £330,000 a year. And plans for shared services are expected to save a further £390,000.

Councils in the North East are working to roll out their successful recruitment portal. It will deliver savings of £12.5 million by reducing the costs of recruitment (such as by through reduced advertising).

Councils in the North West are saving £1.2 million each through a joint tendering processes known as 'Chest' that lets them to access a wider range of competitive suppliers. To date over 16,000 businesses have registered nearly 60 per cent of which are small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

And in London councils have saved over £11m using a 'care funding calculator' which makes sure social care services meet individual needs through transparent pricing.

All of local government needs to start now thinking like this to maintain services, and CIPFA has an important role to play in supporting local authorities.

### LGA Place Based Productivity

The Local Government Association is showing its leadership and commitment.

Their Place Based Productivity will help councils improve performance, make savings and respond to agreed budget cuts, whilst protecting front-line services.

This programme will help councils develop tools to deliver local solutions, building on good practice on a range of priority areas, from procurement to democratic leadership, from data and transparency to adult social care.

This is all about local government leading the way.

Of course, central government is fully behind it. And there's huge interest in Place Based budgets right across Whitehall. From the Prime Minister, the DPM and the Chancellor.

And we stand ready to work with the LGA. In other words, how can we move further and faster to promote localism, decentralise, and increase transparency to citizens?

Indeed, we are committed to tackling central government barriers and burdens. And have been asking local government workers to help us cut red tape.

We anticipate that the programme will identify future models for driving greater productivity, as well as better service outcomes for citizens and neighbourhoods.

However, identifying areas of potential savings will mean nothing unless the sector embeds and drives change.

Knowing that economies of scale are possible from collectively buying common commodities like tarmac or paper will not ease the pressure on front line services if local authorities don't establish collaborative processes.

CIPFA's own 'Sharing the Gain' report shows the benefits of sharing services and offers support authorities thinking of taking this approach.

It is important that councils get the financial and legal support needed around transformational change.

You and your members are well placed to do this at this crucial time. When there is less money to go about better financial management is essential.

### Conclusion

So, there will be real challenges as we face the future.

But there are many things we can do to ensure that frontline services are protected, and that local people are able to hold local government to account.

We know that a big part that will only happen if councils can be driven by outputs and local priorities, instead of artificial reporting requirements from the centre. So we are removing those.

But we are keen to hear from you about what should include on our hit list.

We are also keen to hear about local innovations that we can champion.

I urge CIPFA and its members to engage with this agenda wherever they can - helping local authorities to join up with partners, highlight good practice, and help the LGA improve productivity.

This is not about central government imposing solutions. It is about taking a localist approach, and trusting local authorities and local people to know what is best for their area.",bob-neill,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/bobneill,"Cavendish Conference Centre, 22 Duchess Mews, London W1G 9DT",,,,8-Sep-2010,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,bob-neill,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

In 2005, humanity became a mostly urban species. For the first time in the history of the world, there were more people living in cities than outside of them. By 2050 it is projected that cities will account for three-quarters of the global population. It is therefore no exaggeration to say that cities are the future.

Of course, urbanisation is at its most dramatic in the emerging economies. For instance, China now has more than one hundred cities with a population of more than one million.

> ""By 2050 it is projected that cities will account for three-quarters of the global population.""

But cities are of crucial importance to the western world too. In fact, the argument that I want to make today, is that the battle for growth - for Britain's economic future - will be won or lost in our cities.

In doing so, I want to focus on the long-term. Because while there is no doubting the seriousness of the immediate economic challenges that we face right now, we also have to understand the underlying causes.

In particular, we have to face up to the fact that, as a country, the world does not owe us a living. The only way to pay for the standard of living that we aspire to is to produce high value goods and services that the rest of the world wants to buy and in the provision of which we can offer a comparative advantage. This is a constant challenge in a world where the awesome economic potential of China and India is constantly moving forward.

One of the ways in which we do - and can - offer a comparative advantage is in our ability to cope with complexity. According to the Harvard economist Ricardo Hausmann;

> ""The difference in wealth and income between nations is closely related to the ability of firms to take on complex tasks.""

He notes that in America the average employee collaborates in some way with 100 co-workers. In India, he says, the equivalent figure is just four. The relevance to urban policy is that cities are engines of complexity: their primary purpose, their raison d'etre, is to facilitate human interaction to a degree that would not be possible anywhere else.

> ""The battle for economic growth- for Britain's future, will be won or lost in our cities.""

Cities are often compared to living organisms. However, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Generally, the larger a living creature, the slower its metabolism. For instance, an elephant has a slower heartbeat than a mouse. In a successful city, the opposite is true.

In a city that succeeds, the larger an urban population, the faster the exchange of money, information, ideas and all the other interactions that fuel a dynamic economy. Of course, there are costs to supporting a larger population. But crucially these don't have to increase as fast as the benefits.

Again, this is down to the power of complex interaction. In particular, the way that cities enable people to share the energy and infrastructure resources they depend upon. For instance, the size and density of a city population allows forms of mass transit that just wouldn't be viable in other areas. In this respect cities transcend the limits of the natural world: they grow, but don't slow. Contrary to their popular reputation, cities can be the most environmentally-friendly places on earth.

However, cities are not the only engine of complexity. Consider the impact of globalisation. Political and technological progress has enabled new connections to be made on a completely different scale - worldwide communication networks, international markets, global supply chains. With the whole planet to choose from, the possibilities are endless. Certainly, greater than can be offered by any local economy. This has been good for some cities - especially centres of global trade, but bad for others - particularly centres of industries where competitive advantage has moved elsewhere.

And yet, as is becoming obvious, globalisation is not without its own limits. As an engine of complexity it depends upon its capacity to sustain _long-distance_ relationships - something which is coming under strain from a number of different factors:

  * energy prices are pushing up the cost of travel and transportation
  * the financial crisis is undermining trust in cross-border institutions
  * and the rise of domestic consumption in Asia will mean more alternatives to exports to the West.

This doesn't mean that the world is about to de-globalise, but rather that the age of _easy_ globalisation is over.

And that's a big opportunity for our cities. They too can support the complex interactions which a dynamic economy needs, but they do so on the basis of proximity not distance. This has several advantages:

  * lower transportation costs
  * the availability of local knowledge to inform investment decisions
  * and the trust and understanding engendered by face-to-face, as opposed to electronic, communication.

This doesn't mean that we're going to see a wholesale re-location of manufacturing from east to west. That would be unrealistic and in some ways undesirable. But the balance is shifting. And our cities - the meeting point of complexity and proximity - are in pole position to benefit.

This matters to us because Britain has the potential to be a world beater at doing cities well. We have the advantage of being the first country in the world to have modern, industrial cities. We have many generations' experience in working out how to manage cities and keep them functioning.

To take a topical example, our land use planning policies and procedures have helped ensure that the economic, social and environmental consequences of development are considered together. It is very clear that economic growth cannot be sustained in a relentlessly degrading environment. As cities in developing countries look at how to cope with growth, there are many lessons that we can share on how, with the right polices and structures, growth can make places better not worse.

And, generally, we have been successful. London today - in its energy, beauty, diversity, and as a cradle of opportunity and excellence - is one of the most admired cities the world has ever known. Our great cities outside London have been household names all over the world. After decades of decline in the second half of the last century, the last 25 years have seen a real sense of renaissance - city centres reversing the flight of population, and creating more jobs.

But for all that, I believe our cities can do much better. Take, for example, the eight largest English cities outside of London: Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle, Nottingham, Bristol and Birmingham. Known collectively as the 'core cities', together they contain:

  * sixteen million people, almost a third of the population of England
  * more than a quarter of our highly skilled workers
  * and half of the country's leading research universities.

Unsurprisingly, they generate a huge part of England's wealth - 27 per cent - which is more than London. And yet, there is strong evidence that, compared to the national average, most of our core cities are doing worse than the equivalent cities in Germany, France and Italy.

For instance, in Germany all eight of the biggest cities outside Berlin outperform the country in terms of GDP per capita. The same goes for all but two of the Italian core cities. In France, three of the eight outperform the national average and none fall significantly below it. But for England, seven of the eight core cities underperform - with Bristol as the only exception. Much the same pattern applies when it comes to the percentage of the workforce educated to tertiary level and to per capita rates of innovation. Despite the regeneration we've undoubtedly seen in our cities over the last 25 years, there is room for improvement.

So, what do our cities need to compete globally?

Let me start with what they don't need, which is over-reliance on the public sector. Perpetual debt-funded job creation is simply not sustainable. And not just because it is unaffordable. Compared to their European counterparts, the core cities hold their own when it comes to the proportion of highly qualified workers that they have - but they do much worse when it comes to innovation as measured by patent applications per capita.

The causes of this gap are complex. But if the brightest and the best people all work for the state, then they are obviously not available to drive the commercial innovation that is the only way of creating jobs that pay for themselves. The need to rebalance the economy away from government and finance is something that applies to the whole country, of course - but no more so than in our cities. Policy makers are not job creators - at least, not directly. Rather, our task is to provide the best possible conditions for those who are - the entrepreneurs who create jobs on the basis of productivity not subsidy.

For cities, the highest priority must be to attract these innovators. To become the place where the most mobile and dynamic people in the world choose to live and work. In doing so, the challenges facing our cities is to combine their two great advantages: complexity and proximity.

Doing this successfully surely requires an in-depth knowledge of the people and places each city brings together. That is why urban policy has to involve vesting more powers in cities themselves - rather than seeking to run them as franchises of Whitehall. Cities themselves must take the lead. And leadership counts.

Nations, corporations, teams, schools, cities - all can be well-led or poorly-led. And in each case it makes a big difference whether they are or not. In helping our cities to flourish, it seems to me we should do what we can to widen the opportunity for strong leadership. I believe that it is no coincidence that the world's leading cities usually have a visible leader with a clear executive authority - just as nations and corporations do. A look at nations and companies makes it clear that having a clear leader does not guarantee success. But it helps.

Few people in London - whoever they plan to vote for in May - think London is better off without having a mayor to stand up for them. Our second city - Birmingham - is twinned with Frankfurt, Milan, Lyon and Chicago, all of whom are led by an executive mayor. I believe that an elected major is not a substitute for the multi-layered co-operation that is what cities are all about, but as the embodiment of this ideal:

  * as the human face of a responsive local democracy
  * the honest broker of an active civil society
  * the chief ambassador of a thriving urban economy.

I believe that the restoration of mayors to our great cities has the potential to be a major factor in bringing a new assertiveness and confidence to government outside London.

We have made this choice possible through the Localism Act, which received Royal Assent last year. In May we will give the people of eleven of the largest cities in England the opportunity to decide whether or not to have an elected mayor. Another, Leicester, chose last year to become a mayoral authority. And if enough local people ask for one, the Localism Act also allows other cities to hold a mayoral referendum too.

The Localism Act provides many other freedoms to local communities - as do our housing and planning reforms. However, we regard these measures as the foundation, not the capstone of our commitment to localism.

Having inherited the legacy of decades of centralisation, this Government has had to drive the process of decentralisation from the centre. By definition, only those that have power can give it away. But with the progressive empowerment of our communities, we need to think about decentralisation in a very different way.

In particular, cities should have an ever bigger part to play in shaping the ongoing process of reform. The Localism Act gives cities a right of initiative. This means that instead of ministers deciding what new powers should be given away, city leaders should be able to put forward their own proposals - to make the case for taking control of specific resources and responsibilities currently held by central government. We believe that a bespoke process of decentralisation is the best way of giving cities what they need to unlock economic growth and social progress in their communities.

Clearly, each case will be different. It will require a specific deal to be struck between the city and the various departments and agencies of central government. That is why we have created the Cities Unit at the heart of the government; not to tell cities what to do, but to facilitate _city-led_ initiatives - working with the full authority of Downing Street to hammer out agreements across Whitehall.

In many ways, this turns the established order on its head. But this is as it should be. To attract entrepreneurs to our cities, city leaders must themselves be entrepreneurial, acting proactively to constantly improve the liveability and workability of their communities. To do so, they must come to Whitehall not as supplicants, as in the past, but as equal participants in an open and constructive deal making process.

We are already negotiating with the eight core cities. But this is only just start, the first wave of deal making process that will be expanded in the coming months. Indeed, I've been greatly encouraged by the desire that other cities have shown to be part of the City Deals initiative. That's just as well - because as today's report makes clear, the rebalancing and revival depends on all of Britain's cities, not a favoured few.

So I would encourage every city represented here today to consider the vision that you have for your community - and the deal that you need to make it happen.

As Cities Minister, I greatly look forward to hearing your proposals.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,"City Hall, London",,,,23-Jan-2012,,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government

Thanks Hank and Peter for having me back.

Every time I come to the Building Research Establishment it sparks off new ideas.

The last time I came here I was in opposition. I shadowed four different housing ministers in opposition and I quickly discovered that it's very easy to make quick and rash announcements. But when I said we'd nail the definition of zero carbon within weeks, we did - 50 weeks!

Zero carbon is now clearer for you. It is a very important agenda and I'm glad to see it being supported here. I've recently recognised the environmental importance of our buildings myself - I've put solar panels on the roof of my home.

Technical and innovative experiments are important to delivering homes at zero carbon in five year's time. The year 2016 isn't the deadline it was when it was first mooted - it is now very close indeed.

So I pay tribute to the work here at the Building Research Establishment to try and achieve that.

But on the occasions when I've visited here before I've often gone away with concerns - how are we going to sell to a sceptical public the designs of buildings that appeal to some people, but not others? Zero carbon was starting to be associated with strange-looking properties that are alien to traditional British homes. I have no particular architectural style or period in mind, but we need to cater for everyone and we can't have a style that puts people's backs up.

I think the Prince of Wales himself had it right when he said:

> ""It doesn't wear its 'greenness' as if it was the latest piece of haute couture, it is much more concerned with what works on the high street in terms of good manners and courtesy.""

I couldn't agree more - less about Scandinavian-style eco-bling dangling over houses, more about somewhere to call home. I think that's been achieved with the Natural House here at the Building Research Establishment.

It looks like an Islington terrace - except it looks out onto a forest! But it demonstrates that all types of technology can be used together to reduce the carbon footprint. This wouldn't have been possible without your hard work.

I also want to announce that I've encouraged the Local Government Association and the Home Builders Federation to put together a group, chaired by Sir John Harman, to look at making it easier to deliver homes on the ground by simplifying the plethora of local housing standards that are out there and scrutinising viability. 

So thanks to you for working on the Natural House - the fact is that from 2016 homes will be more efficient and zero carbon - I don't think any other industry is working that rapidly. 

So from me to you - thank you very much indeed.",grant-shapps,Minister of State,Minister for Housing and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/grantshapps,"Building Research Establishment, Watford",,,,28-Jun-2011,improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment,,,,grant-shapps,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/articles/newsroom/2145549,"Tory minister, Labour mayor: we fight together for Liverpool","* * *

Economic growth does not happen in the abstract - it happens in particular places where existing employers expand their production or new firms are attracted to locate for the first time.

Britain is one the most urban countries in the world. So, unless our cities are places which foster and attract enterprise, investment and job creation then Britain itself will not return to growth with the strength that is needed.

That is why we have joined forces - a Conservative Minister and a Labour Mayor - to represent the UK at the New Cities Summit in Paris this week. We are meeting, together, potential investors of global significance, and the leaders of cities around the world with a successful track record of attracting international investment.

Our united message is that Liverpool isn't just open for business, but is committed to a course that will restore its position as a world-beating centre of trade, culture and innovation. It is an ambition that begins at the top, with a UK mayor who will provide the primary point of contact for inward investors, and the political leadership needed to unlock each and every barrier to growth.

This is not solely out of faith in the enterprising potential of the city - it is also a matter of practicality. These are tough times and the days when we could just rely on an ever-expanding public sector to provide jobs are over. The same goes for the old culture of debt-fuelled consumerism and destructive speculation.

The cold, hard reality is that Britain - and each of its cities - has to earn its way. Moreover, we must do so sustainably. Other parts of the world may compete by exploiting their people and their environment, but to maintain our standard of living and our quality of life, we must compete on what makes us great as a nation: our inventiveness, our creativity, our cultural vitality.

These resources are at their most concentrated in our cities. The challenge is to make the most of them. In the past, it is a task in which we have sometimes failed as a nation. Worse still, we have drawn the wrong lessons from each setback, by depriving our cities of the confident self-governance that made them so great in the first place.

There is perhaps no clearer example than Liverpool. Few would claim that, in the era of Militant, the city showed its best side to the world. However, those events were a trigger for a mistake on the side of the political divide: a further wave of centralisation in which power was locked away in Westminster and Whitehall, adding to the steady accumulation of top-down government control.

And, yet, Liverpool is also where the tide of centralisation began to turn. Michael Heseltine - an early advocate for decentralisation and now a proud Freeman of the City of Liverpool - helped Liverpool find its way back from the brink. Looking back, we can the see the groundbreaking regeneration projects of that time as a milestone in the long revival of our cities.

Now the time has come to move into a higher gear. We need to rebalance the economy away from the public sector and towards the private sector - and away from high finance and towards a much broader range of activities in which all our cities can excel. In pursuing this goal, policy makers must remember that we are not job creators - at least, not directly. Rather, our task is to provide the best possible conditions for those who are - the entrepreneurs who create jobs on the basis of productivity not subsidy.

For cities, the highest priority must be to attract these entrepreneurs. To become the place where the most mobile and dynamic people in the world choose to live and work. Doing this successfully surely requires an in-depth knowledge of the people and places each city brings together. That is why policies for growth cannot be, and have never been, exclusively led by the centre. Cities themselves must take the lead. And for this they need leaders with power and authority.

As Labour Mayor and Conservative Minister, we are working together through the City Deals programme to negotiate the return of power to local people. Liverpool was, in fact, the first City Deal to be announced, but this is just the start of a process that will be widened and deepened in the months ahead. Not least, in Liverpool itself.

Reversing decades of centralisation and driving growth in our cities is not easy - but, for urban Britain, it is essential. Our needs are too great - and our hope are too high - to tolerate the status quo.

### Transcript

Stephen [Greenhalgh], I want to start by thanking you and your colleagues for hosting us today.

Your work is absolutely leading the way. It's what the future of local government is going to be.

Over the past four years, you've cut council tax, and consistently delivered high-quality services.

The most important thing is that you didn't wait for Ministers to tell you what to do.

There's no reason why every council can't do the same.

As you know, next week, the Government will set out the spending plans for the next four years.

None of you will be under any illusions about exactly how tough that will be.

But we have got to face the facts.

Face up to the legacy we were left.

The crippling public deficit. The black hole in the nation's finances.

We can't forget how close to the economic abyss we came.

And we can't pretend that we are somehow too big to fail.

The decisions we're taking in the spending review are essential to preserve this fragile recovery. To retain our international credibility. To restore economic credibility.

But above all, we've been working towards a fair deal which protects the front-line services people rely on.

Locally, too, there's a wrong response and a right response.

The wrong response is to panic.

The wrong response would be to slash and burn spending, regardless of where it's going.

To salami slice services, in the assumption that one day you can go back to the old spending patterns. You can't.

There is another way. As Hammersmith and Fulham and others show.

Putting everything they do under the spotlight.

Asking if every penny they spend is going to the right place.

Not just asking 'how can we save money' but 'what do we really need to be doing.'

Do we need to be bringing in hired guns to lobby government?

Do we need separate planning departments? Lawyers? Communications teams?

Chief executives, even?

Or should we be focusing on the issues that really matter?

Better schools. Safer streets. Regular bin collections.

Most councils don't need me to point this out.

They've seen which way the wind was blowing for a long time.

But frankly, others are bleating about the difficulties they face while letting money slip through their fingers.

Without picking on Islington, their internal audit, checking invoices to thirty of the council's top suppliers, found ten had been paid twice. Two more were paid three times.

That was £55 000 overpaid. Through just a fraction of all their invoices.

One off mistakes might be understandable.

But a recent report from Experian suggests the problem runs much deeper in some places.

Their work with Leeds City Council has recovered around half a million pounds of overpayments.

Experian estimates that if this simple exercise were repeated in all of England's local authorities it could save up to £147 million.

Now, you might say well, that is small potatoes. Hardly enough to plug the gaping holes in the public deficit. But actually, £147 million would pay the wages of nearly nine thousand care workers.

And more importantly, it betrays a particular attitude. A lack of respect towards public money. And at every level of government, that has got to change.

This was one of the first things I wanted to address in my own department.

That is why I've made it my mission to cut back on anything wasteful.

I worry we've forgotten whose money it is.

It's not ours. We are entrusted with it. We can't fritter it away.

All of us, my department as well as councils, have got to be able to look people straight in the eye.

And say, hand on heart, nothing is being wasted.

That's why we're asking councils to throw open their books. Become much more transparent and open. And why we're doing the same.

Greater transparency will really revolutionise the way government works.

It will say to suppliers: government is no longer there to be fleeced.

It will make every single government employee think twice before they get out the public credit card.

And it will mean that the public can judge public spending for themselves.

They won't forgive councils who don't cut out all the waste before squeezing the services.

And perhaps public servants will take extra care not to overpay suppliers, when they know there's an army of armchair auditors checking their working.

So as Baroness Eaton says;

> ""we should cut 100 per cent of the waste, red tape and junketing before we even contemplate reductions to front line services.""

But if the first step is to absolutely eliminate all traces of waste. The second is much more radical.

This might be an enforced opportunity. But it's an opportunity nonetheless.

A chance to re-examine the way that every council works. The way every single service is delivered.

No-one can just fall back on throwing money at problems.

And if the past decade has shown anything, it's that that won't work anyway.

Nor does the solution lie in unitary restructuring. There is no point wasting time on divisive, expensive plans dreamt up and directed by Whitehall.

Instead, there are a lot of common sense solutions that councils have got well underway.

Birmingham are saving £430 000 a year just by sorting their own post. They plan to save around £540 million through changing the way their back office service works.

Worcestershire have counted 24 agencies working with young people not working or studying in their area - and know they can offer a better service if they get rid of the duplication.

That gives some indication of just how much room around the edges there can be.

The LGA said a couple of weeks ago that joining up services properly could save around £5 billion a year. And they are leading some great stuff in their productivity programme.

But you've heard about better procurement. Sharing services. Sharing chief executives. And greater efficiencies for years now.

It makes it even more surprising that not every council has got their act in gear.

Because we aren't talking about economising; tinkering round the edges; being a bit more thrifty.

We're talking really radical, creative, innovative stuff. Transforming everything that councils do.

Councils like Nottinghamshire and Somerset are reviewing every single service that they offer. As Councillor Maddox says: they are asking:

  * Does it really need to be done?
  * Does it provide value for money?
  * Are we the best people to be doing it?

I want to support them in every possible way.

Not through handouts and instructions and diktats.

But by getting out of the way. Letting them make their own decisions. By making localism a reality.

It's fairer. It's more efficient. And it's more democratic.

As the Prime Minister has said;

> ""we feel the importance of this in our heads as well as our hearts.""

It's not my job to sit behind my desk like some sort of puppet master, pulling all the strings, taking all the decisions.

Instead of seeing how tightly I can pull those strings, I spent the past few months cutting them.

I've put an end to regional bureaucracy.

To interference from government offices.

To endless inspections.

And I've started a 'bonfire of the inanities'.

When stacked up together, they aren't just minor irritants but major barriers.

Hammersmith and Fulham alone came up with more than a hundred bureaucratic burdens taking up their time and energy.

And I can promise you, Stephen, I'm working on it. We've already sorted out several of them.

But I don't plan to stop there.

Time and time again, I hear complaints from councils about how much of a burden the national indicator set is.

Not because measurement and targets are always a bad thing.

If councils, working with the residents, want to set themselves goals to aim for, that's up to them. It could actually help in being accountable, clear and transparent.

But national targets mean that councils are constantly working on things which matter to Whitehall, regardless of whether local residents give two hoots about them.

I'd much rather councils were tackling local issues than telling me about them.

There are 66 pages of guidance telling councils how to report on national indicator 179.

Ironically, it's supposed to measure how efficient councils are.

Kent reckon it costs them more than a million pounds a year to deal with inspections and regulation.

Add in what the local police force, health service and the district council are expected to do, and a conservative estimate of the total looks more like £7 million.

They think they currently have to measure their performance against no fewer than fifteen hundred different indicators.

It beggars belief.

The money being spent on form fillers and bean counters could be far better spent helping elderly people to stay in their homes. Or almost anything, in fact.

So today, I'm scrapping the existing local area agreements.

I'm handing over control over more than 4,700 targets to councils and their voters. To keep or dump as they see fit.

And instead of the National Indicator Set, and instead of every single department's endless demands that you measure this, that or the other, I'm promising today that there's just going to be one list of every bit of data that Government needs from you.

Which I'll be in charge of. So let's make it as short as possible. Let's sort out, together, the minimum that Government actually needs to know.

So instead of red tape and regulation, instead of instructions and inspections, we're giving councils what they've wanted for decades.

Freedom. Power. Responsibility.

Able to make your own decisions on housing. A stronger say on planning. A central role in the NHS. And in the driving seat of the local economy, thanks to the local enterprise partnerships.

And that's just for starters. The localism bill, which we'll unveil in a few weeks, will go even further.

Councils will be able to organise themselves however they want.

Through a general power of competence, they will be able to do whatever they want.

That's up to them, and your voters. Not to me.

And perhaps most importantly of all. I want to make sure that councils are in charge of their own money.

We've said they can borrow against future business rates in order to invest.

They can keep the money from rents.

They'll be able to agree locally to pooling their budgets across the public sector to better tackle social problems.

And we've already freed up more than a billion pounds worth of ring fenced funding.

But we can do a lot more.

[Political content removed]

Durham has counted 58 different funding streams for housing and regeneration.

Dorset, Poole and Bournemouth have counted 80 agencies investing in economic growth in the area - many of them spending less than £50,000.

Councils haven't been allowed to do things their way. They can't spend it on anything else; and they have to spend it all in order to get more next time.

Whatever money was coming in. By the time the rules had been followed. The forms had been filled. The conditions had been satisfied. There's always going to be a lot less.

It's a recipe for financial madness.

Where's the reason to be efficient? Where's the incentive to be imaginative? What point is there in listening to local voters instead of central government?

Well, I do not want to be an overbearing parent. Handing out your pocket money and telling to exactly what to spend it on.

I have far too much respect for local government.

And that's why, as part of the spending review, we've been working to make those artificial barriers come down.

Putting an end to those vanity funding pots.

Putting as much money as possible into just one cheque, for councils and residents to work out for themselves how they want to spend it.

But with the power, the freedom and the money, comes the responsibility to act on that power.

To do everything possible to protect frontline services.

To target spending at the most vulnerable.

To commissioning really effective and productive services: not just the same old, same old - and bringing in the voluntary sector.

And above all, to be proactive.

I do not want councils turning to me on every little issue.

Paralysed in case they do the 'wrong thing'.

The past decade has stifled councils. Created a culture of dependency.

Some councils feel like they can't do anything without my permission.

It's hardly surprising, when councils have been tied to the apron strings for so long.

But we need to replace this culture of fear and paralysis.

We need a new culture of action and decisiveness.

A culture that is very evident here in Hammersmith and Fulham.

The public does not need to be patronised.

They understand there are incredibly tough decisions to be made.

They don't want a blame game.

But they will want to make sure that their council, as well as their government, is doing everything possible to protect front-line services that they rely on.

I have done my part in the spending review negotiations. Councils must also do theirs.

Cutting out every penny of waste.

Becoming more creative and imaginative.

And facing up to the challenge, not ducking it.

I have led a council myself. I have sat in the chair. I have dealt with the budget. I have the deepest respect for those, like Stephen, who approach these difficult times imaginatively and thoughtfully.

And I can promise you that I will be an enthusiastic champion in Cabinet through these difficult times.

I will make sure that you have what you need to tackle the challenges you face.

Local government's natural instinct is to innovate and to adapt.

Local government is often the place that finds the best solutions to any number of social challenges: in poverty, in housing.

And I want to ensure that, even in tight financial times, you have more power to shape services around the needs of your people.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,"Hammersmith & Fulham Town Hall, London",,,,13-Oct-2010,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2084343,Unlocking growth in cities: Liverpool city deal,"* * *

On 8 December 2011 the Government launched 'Unlocking Growth in Cities', which set out the terms for a programme of city deals - binding agreements which enable cities to negotiate the devolution of the specific powers, resources and responsibilities required to meet locally-determined economic and social objectives. We have been clear that we are determined to work flexibly to promote growth, to encourage local initiative and willing to transfer significant powers to cities.

The Government has now considered the proposals brought forward by Liverpool for a 'City Deal' in response to this challenge. The Government recognises it represents an ambitious economic package aimed at driving growth in Liverpool, and that it is an important part of the City's response to Lord Heseltine and Sir Terry Leahy's ""Rebalancing Britain"" report on the Liverpool economy.

I am therefore pleased to inform the House that the Government has approved the following proposals from Liverpool as a 'City Deal':

1. Subject to HM Treasury clearance of a business case and agreement with the Local Enterprise Partnership, the Government will designate a new Enterprise Zone covering the City Fringe Buffer Zone and Central Business District. The growth in Business Rates income from the Enterprise Zone will go to the Liverpool City Region Local Enterprise Partnership, in line with the Government's wider Enterprise Zone policy and our ambition to see a city-region wide approach to growth and regeneration. The Government recognises that Liverpool has ambitious plans to develop five further priority economic development areas (proposed Mayoral Development Zones) in the city, and their ambition to reinvest rates retained from this new Enterprise Zone within the city. Any retention of Enterprise Zone business rates by the city council will need to be negotiated between Liverpool and the Local Enterprise Partnership.

2. The creation of what Liverpool propose to term a Mayoral Investment Board that will oversee the city's economic and housing strategy as well as oversight of the development of Home and Communities Agency's land assets and other economic development priorities including those linked to the Enterprise and proposed Mayoral Development Zones. This arrangement will be based on the principle that the Home and Communities Agency will retain legal ownership and accountable body status for current Home and Communities Agency assets.

3. The Department for Work and Pensions will work with Liverpool to develop welfare pilots to deliver a localised programme of support for people leaving the Work Programme and in particular include a 'youth contract' pathfinder. It is expected that this will improve the benefit claims experience for customers while making efficiency savings for both the City and the Department for Work and Pensions; increase the numbers of claimants moving into work; and reduce benefit fraud and error.

4. A Secondary School Investment Plan funded by the Council for up to twelve new build secondary schools, including at least six new academies. These schools will be subject to the normal Academy converter application process and once in place, the Council will not be part of their ongoing governance or financial management. Liverpool have made clear their commitment to ensure that the schools in the city support the local skills agenda and the local economy. The Government therefore expects the Council to be proactive and work with the schools, the private sector and the universities in Liverpool to help them develop specialisms and identify and attract appropriate sponsors.

5. The Government is prepared to support initiatives that boost economic growth and development. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) already supports economic development in local authorities and is therefore prepared to work closely with the City as Liverpool implements its vision for economic development. As part of that close working, the Department for Communities and Local Government will contribute £75 million over the remaining years of the spending review period, subject to a strong, robust business case, to be cleared by HM Treasury, demonstrating clear value for money.

6. The Government set out in 'Unlocking Growth in Cities', that where cities want to take on significant new powers and funding streams, they will need to demonstrate strong, accountable leadership, an ambitious agenda for the economic future of their area, effective decision-making structures, and private sector involvement and leadership. The appropriate governance structure may be different for each city, and no city deal is conditional on having any particular governance arrangement. However, the Government believes that directly elected mayors are one way of providing the strong, visible and accountable leadership so, subject to approval by the Council, the Government can confirm that a move towards a directly elected mayor and the creation of a Mayoral Development Corporation would satisfy its requirements as regards governance arrangements to strengthen leadership and accountability in Liverpool City Council.

The Government places great importance on Local Enterprise Partnerships to drive economic development, and therefore expect Liverpool to continue to work closely with the Liverpool City Region Local Enterprise Partnership and neighbouring authorities to ensure their support for this 'City Deal' and to take it forward as well as future decentralisation packages covering the Local Enterprise Partnership area.",greg-clark,Minister of State,Minister for Decentralisation and Cities,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark,,written-statement,7-Feb-2012,,,,,,,greg-clark,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/legacyresearchbuilding,Unpublished research reports: building and the environment,"* * *

Today the Government is publishing a further group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration. There is a significant backlog of unpublished reports that were produced by the previous government and over the next few months we will be publishing further reports in groups themed on particular topics.

The reports and findings are of general policy interest, especially on the issues of building and the environment, but they do not explicitly relate to forthcoming policy announcements and are not necessarily a reflection or statement of the current Government's policy positions. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research. For transparency, all completed work is being published regardless of format or robustness.

The [six reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume5/) published today represent the findings from research projects at a total cost of £697,819. These findings cover the topics of building and the environment.

> (i) _Domestic sector airtightness_. This report by the Centre for Built Environment assesses the impact on airtightness of different methods of construction and the implications for future Building Regulations policy. The work found that certain construction types are intrinsically more airtight than others, and that dry-lined masonry cavity and steel framed construction require much greater attention to detail if they are to reliably achieve high levels of airtightness. The complexity of design can have a significant impact, and certain approaches are likely to be more robust than others. This report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £233,325.
> 
> (ii) _Condensation risk - impact of improvements to Part L and robust details on Part C_. This report by Faber Maunsell evaluates the impact of higher insulation and airtightness levels on moisture performance and interstitial and surface condensation risks. It highlights how hygrothermally robust detailing and appropriate workmanship is critical to the achievement of energy efficient, healthy and comfortable buildings; and how possible degradation of building materials and the deterioration of thermal performance as a consequence of the calculated maximum amount of moisture should be considered. The report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £158,560.
> 
> (iii) _Evaluation of unventilated pitched roofs with vapour permeable membrane_. This report by Faber Maunsell identifies an ideal calculation approach to predicting condensation risk in unventilated roof systems might be via a whole building simulation package. It also identifies why the performance of roof underlays should not be considered in isolation from the whole roof system including moisture vapour movement from the interior through the ceiling. The report was commissioned in 2003 at a cost of £113,103.
> 
> (iv) _Product emission labelling scheme - scoping study_. The report by AECOM investigates the potential for introducing a scheme to label building products for their emissions of volatile organic compounds. It describes existing schemes, identifies relevant British, European, International and American standards, and outlines research into the health effects of volatile organic compounds. The report was commissioned in 2005 at a cost of £45,972.
> 
> (v) _Comparing PStar and co-heating test results_. This report by AECOM compares the 'PStar' method for determining heat losses from a dwelling with the more established 'co-heating' method. The study showed that PStar tests take three days to complete and have the potential to be used for compliance purposes, but the results they produce are different from co-heating test results, and further investigations are needed. The report was commissioned in 2008 at a cost of £29,000.
> 
> (vi) _Reducing water consumption in buildings_. This report prepared by WRc (as part of a CIRIA-led consortium) addresses issues connected with reducing water consumption in buildings. The report recommendations were used to inform a comprehensive review of Approved Document G to the Building Regulations. The report was commissioned in 2008 at a cost of £117,859.

At a time when public budgets must be reduced, the new Government wants to ensure its research delivers best possible value for money for the taxpayer and that sums expended are reasonable in relation to the public policy benefits obtained.

Today the Government is publishing the tenth group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous administration.  
  
There is a significant backlog of unpublished reports that were produced by the previous government and we have been publishing these in groups themed on a particular topic.  
  
The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our Freedom of Information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research.  
  
The 14 reports published today represent the findings from nine research projects at a total cost of £708,000. These findings cover the topic of Communities.

> (i) _Engaging Behaviour: Behavioural economics and citizen engagement_   
This study considered the application of behavioural economics to explain the motivations for people to take part in civic activities such as petitioning and volunteering, particularly among people who 'buck the trends' among their peers.  
  
(ii) _Quirk asset transfer demonstration programme  
_This report examines the attitudes of councillors, council officers and community organisations involved in the Advancing Assets for Communities demonstration programme. It explores actual and potential benefits of the programme; perceptions of the risks associated with asset transfer; and how success can be evaluated.  
  
(iii) _Process evaluation for Communitybuilders  
_This process evaluation assessed the implementation and operation of the £70m Communitybuilders fund. It aimed to look at whether the programme was working as planned, understand the early successes and failures, and identify lessons for the programme as it progressed.  
  
(iv) _Sharing data to improve local employment outcomes: Evaluation of the local data share pilots  
_This report considers the impact and implications of a project to test ways of sharing data in order to tackle worklessness at a local level, conducted jointly between the Department for Work and Pensions and DCLG in 2009-10. The report focuses on the factors that helped the three pilot sites progress their data sharing, factors that the pilot sites found to be more challenging and the results of the data share.  
  
(v) _Decentralisation outcomes: A review of evidence and analysis of international data  
_This research reviewed the extensive literature on definitions of decentralisation and empirical research identifying the outcomes of decentralisation. The authors also analysed two large European survey data sets and used econometric modelling techniques to assess the contribution of decentralisation to wellbeing and satisfaction with government/democracy/health/education.  
  
(vi) _The benefits of meaningful interaction: Rapid review and assessment of the existing literature  
_This study reviewed the existing literature on successful approaches to and the benefits of meaningful interaction for individuals, neighbours and communities, for example in terms of improvements in health, welfare and life in general.  
  
(vii) _Evaluation of the REACH National Role Model Programme  
_(viii) _Media representations of black young men and boys: Report of the REACH media monitoring project  
_These two reports resulted from the REACH programme which was led jointly by the Black community and the previous Government and was designed to raise the aspirations and achievements of Black boys and young Black men. The evaluation and the media analysis project were commissioned in order to support the delivery of the REACH role modelling programme. The media analysis project was based on a survey of media sources in 2008.

(ix)-(xiv) Six reports presenting the findings from a series of projects which tested the feasibility of tracking central government funding into deprived neighbourhoods. The projects sought to discern whether such neighbourhoods received a relatively greater proportion of mainstream funding. The projects covered liveability, crime, worklessness, healthcare and Department for Education and Skills funding.

> (ix) _Mapping liveability spend and outcomes: A scoping study_   
  
(x) _Mapping crime reduction and prevention funding_   
  
(xi) _Mapping the flow of government spending on tackling worklessness into disadvantaged areas_   
  
(xii) _Developing a toolkit to map healthcare expenditure in local areas_   
  
(xiii)_ Mapping the flow of Department for Education and Skills funding to disadvantaged areas and investigating the outcomes of this funding: A feasibility study and research review_   
  
(xiv) _Unlocking Capacity - lessons learned from four Connecting Communities areas_

The [eight reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume9housing/) published today represent the findings from five research projects on Housing at a total cost of £1,155,085.

**Summary of reports**

> (i) _Evaluation of the Enhanced Housing Options Trailblazers programme  
_This evaluation monitors and evaluates the progress and outcomes of the 42 projects participating in a programme to deliver integrated housing and employment advice at the local level. The report, which brings together the findings from desk research and field work carried out between April 2009 and October 2010, considers the benefits of a joined-up approach.
> 
> (ii) _Establishing a national baseline of regulatory costs on the house building sector  
_This report estimates the cost of national building regulations. It provides information on the costs facing homebuilders from this source and can be considered relevant to the Governments de-regulatory policy. However, it should be recognised that the estimates only relate to Building Regulations. It does not consider local planning requirements or other regulatory costs which may also impact on viability. The estimates only reflect the cost of Building Regulations at a specific point in time (e.g. February 2010) and are the estimates of Davis Langdon and not the DCLG.
> 
> (iii) _Assessment of the Decent Homes programme - Final report  
_This report evaluates the achievements of the Decent Homes programme in the social sector and aims to facilitate the dissemination of best practice.
> 
> (iv-vii) _Housing market professionals forecast survey_ (4 reports)  
This survey carried out by DCLG, Acadametrics and Ipsos Mori brought together a comprehensive list of forecasts for the housing market for the current and following year. Five groups of housing market experts were surveyed: academics, mortgage lenders, house builders, estate agents and city forecasters. The survey was repeated four times, on a quarterly basis, with the final survey carried out in May 2010 with forecasts for house prices and transactions for 2010 and 2011.

These findings cover the topics of housing and local government.

**Housing reports**

> (i) _Domestic violence: Assistance for households without dependent children_. This study explored the type of assistance provided by local authorities and also other specialist agencies. This report was commissioned in November 2008 at a cost of £70,000.
> 
> (ii) _Cumulative impacts of regulations on house builders and landowners_. This report provides expert advice on the returns expected from landowners when selling land for housing and the factors that drive this. This report was commissioned in June 2008 at a cost of £3,000.

**Homes and Communities Agency report**

> (iii) _New affordable homes: What for whom and where have registered providers been building between 1989 and 2009_. This report analysed available data and evidence to provide an assessment on how the provision and investment of affordable housing by Registered Providers has changed over the last 20 years (1989-2009) with more detailed case study work in five local authorities. This report was commissioned in February 2010 and cost £63,600.

**Local government reports**

> (iv) _Long-term evaluation of local area agreements and local strategic partnerships: Final report_. The report considers the role of local strategic partnerships and the impact of local area agreements, from the point of view of partnership working, efficiency and service improvement. The report was commissioned in 2007 at a cost of £47,898.

The [five reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume8immigration/) published today represent the findings from four research projects on Immigration at a total cost of £165,000.

**Summary of reports**

> (i) _Economics Paper 11 Drivers of International Migration  
_This report considers the factors driving international migration to the UK and the extent to which it is possible to use economic models to predict future immigration to the UK. The paper finds that immigration policy in both the UK and in other destination countries is likely to drive change in net migration. The authors also find a role for the standard economic determinants of immigration, including the economic cycle and relative incomes. Again, the comparison with other host countries is important. In terms of the forecasting of immigration, the authors recommend that immigration should be forecasted probabilistically, rather than as a point estimate, due to the large uncertainties inherent in the forecasting process.
> 
> (ii) _Economics Paper 12 Local Geography of International Migration to the UK_   
This report considers the key factors explaining the spatial location of immigrants over time, using immigration statistics for Government Office Regions in the UK. The paper finds that in general, most of the variation in the share of immigrants going to each region of the UK can be accounted for by ""region fixed effects"". These refer to unobserved factors that cannot be measured easily and that change between regions, but are unlikely to change much over time. Examples of such factors include traditional, cultural, institutional, social, and historical factors. Having controlled for these factors, the paper finds that fewer Asian and A8 immigrants choose to locate in areas where unemployment is higher. In addition, whilst the authors find some evidence that immigrants are attracted to areas with a higher concentration of foreign-born residents, they do not find strong evidence in support of the existence of ""network effects"". It is important to bear in mind, however, that the presence of ""network effects"" may be concealed by the inclusion of the region specific effects in the modelling.
> 
> (iii) _Socio-Economic Integration of Migrants  
_This report looks at the economic and non economic integration of immigrants and their children in the UK. The economic factors the authors look at are the employment rate, the number of years of education and average earnings. The main non economic factors examined are language proficiency, perceived sense of belonging to Britain and civic participation. The analysis finds that on average immigrants in the UK tend to be more educated than natives, but less likely to be in employment. The report also finds that immigrants in the UK earn less than natives, after adjusting for area of settlement. However, the analysis also finds that the observed gaps in labour market outcomes between immigrants and natives tend to narrow over time and that outcomes vary significantly between different immigrant groups.
> 
> (iv) _Identifying Social and Economic Push and Pull Factors for Migration to the UK by Bulgarian and Romanian Nationals  
_This report examines the role of various socio-economic and demographic push and pull factors for immigration into the UK by Bulgarian and Romanian nationals. The report uses information on the occupational choices made by A8 migrants and previous waves of A2 migrants, and information on their patterns of settlement across the UK to infer about the likely distribution of future A2 migrants with similar characteristics.
> 
> (v) _Economic Influences on International Migration for the UK  
_This report, considers the role of the housing market in determining international migration to and from the UK. Four housing market effects (e.g. relative house prices between countries) are analysed, for different population groups defined by country of birth (e.g. EU-born, US-born etc). The study reviewed previous literature on international and regional migration, which have conventionally only considered economic drivers such as relative unemployment rates, incomes and exchange rates.

The [ten reports](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/researcharchive/volume3/) published below represent the findings from research projects at a total cost to taxpayers of £219,597. These findings cover the topics of immigration, the economy and regeneration.

> (i) _Impact of economic downturn on migration_. This discussion paper by A.E. Green reviews the evidence on the likely impact of an economic downturn on both international migration and migration in different parts of the UK, with particular focus on migrants from the A8 countries (of the 2004 accession to the EU). It observes that for 83 per cent of A8 migrants, the main motivation for coming to Britain was to work and earn money. This report was commissioned in 2008 at a cost of £3,400.
> 
> (ii) _Immigration and rural economies_. This report by Heather Wells and Paula Lucci considers the impacts and contributions of international migration to rural economies in the UK. The paper finds that there was a substantial increase in the size of the migrant population in rural areas in the four years before the recession, which was driven by a strong demand for migrant labour from particular industries. Immigration has had a significant but small negative impact on the wages of UK workers at the bottom of the occupational distribution. Challenges from immigration include pressure on existing local services and integration within local communities. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £24,275.
> 
> (iii) _Measuring international and internal migration from the National Pupil Database_. This report by Ludi Simpson, et al considers the dispersion of migrant pupils in the UK. The paper finds the number of immigrant pupils in UK schools has increased significantly in the four year period to 2007-08 and that pupils of African origin tend to be concentrated in Inner London and other major metropolitan areas whilst Eastern European and other European pupils arrived since 2003 tend to be found in the more remote rural areas. A table in Annex 2 gives a breakdown by local authority. This report was commissioned in 2010 by the last administration at a cost of £78,500.
> 
> (iv) _Economic rationale for spatial policies or Why place matters_. This paper by Patricia Rice outlines why there are differences between places, and advocates policy that takes this into account. It considers that variations in outcomes for different areas are a result of regional trade and factor mobility, but seeks to explain the underlying differences between areas. This report was commissioned in 2007 at a cost of £2,034.
> 
> (v) _Addressing the problem of worklessness: The role of regeneration_. This paper by Anne Green, with its focus on worklessness and regeneration considers the complex and challenging real world roles of mainstream policies and area-based programmes, including the roles of local government, the community and employers. It notes that the neighbourhood level is an appropriate level for outreach to disadvantaged residents, and the voluntary sector can play an important role in facilitating community participation. Partnerships have been costly to develop and support, and have not generated the critical mass of support for the neighbourhoods that it was envisaged. This report was commissioned in 2009 as part of a series of four papers which together cost £11,622
> 
> (vi) _Regeneration - What are the problems and what can we achieve in addressing them? Neighbourhood level perspectives from the New Deal for Communities programme_. This paper by Paul Lawless, with its focus on neighbourhood renewal, draws on evidence from the Evaluation of the New Deal for Communities Programme to review the problems faced in the Partnership areas and consider both process and change outcomes that regeneration programmes should seek to achieve. This report was commissioned in 2009 as part of a series of four papers which together cost £11,622.
> 
> (vii) _Regeneration - What are the problems and what can we achieve in addressing them?_ This paper by Pete Tyler, with its focus on local economic activity and regeneration, reviews what lies behind the problems faced by deprived places and notes that although rooted in a general failure of supply and demand mechanisms, problems tend to be multi-dimension and persistent and likely to require substantial policy intervention to make an impact. It anticipated that constraints on public expenditure would inevitably mean that regeneration initiatives would be operating in a more difficult environment. This report was commissioned in 2009 as part of a series of four papers which together cost £11,622.
> 
> (viii) _Regeneration - How should the problem be addressed?_ This paper by Stephen Syrett, reviews the weaknesses of past approaches to regeneration, pointing out the over-dominance of centralised structures, the neglect of education and training in deprived areas, the need for greater clarity over the role and relevance of area-based initiatives. Local capacity will only develop if greater scope and freedom is given to local actors to make their own priorities. This report was commissioned in 2009 as part of a series of four papers which together cost £11,622.
> 
> (ix) _Modelling and forecasting county court claims and order for mortgage repossessions_. This report by Professor John Muellbauer and Janine Aron was commissioned jointly by the former National Housing and Planning Advice Unit and the UK Spatial Economic Centre. The study explores the determinants of mortgage possession court orders as well as forecasting court orders on a regional basis for England and Wales from 2011 to 2015. It observed that the recent house price and credit boom of 2006-08 had increased the proportion of households with overstretched budgets and over-extended debt relative to their assets. The most important determinant of court claims and orders was found to be the debt to income ratio. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £30,366.
> 
> (x) _Housing supply revisited: Evidence from international, national, regional, local and company data_. This report by Michael Ball, et al considers the responsiveness of housing supply to changes in prices and the degree to which planning restrictions and other factors limit this responsiveness. If found that factors other than planning supply influence the responsiveness of housing supply. It suggests that different planning targets are required for each local authority, to reflect local decision making processes. This report was commissioned in 2009 at a cost of £69,400.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/dclgworkchristmas2010,DCLG's work during the Christmas recess 2010,"* * *

In a Written Ministerial Statement to the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has given an update about work undertaken by the Department for Communities and Local Government over the Christmas period.

### Statement

#### Community Rights

The Department has recognised the important role pubs and clubs can play at the centre of the local community. On 30 December we announced a review of restrictive covenants preventing precious community pubs reopening again as public houses or entertainment venues. This review is in line with the Department's commitment to cutting red tape and devolving real power to local communities. By changing the use of restrictive covenants, communities will have greater opportunity to use the community right to buy powers to take over local pubs if they come up for sale and ensure important hubs of community life remain open.

#### Transparency

Six months ago I wrote to all councils calling on them to throw open their files to make local government spending more transparent and show waste is being eradicated. Councils need to show they have done everything possible to reduce waste and duplication to save taxpayers' money and protect frontline services.

The Department continues in its drive for open and transparent government, and on 1 January issued a new year's reminder to Local Authorities that they are expected to publish their spending data over £500 online by the end of January 2011 in accessible formats. Over 180 councils have already shown their commitment to democratic accountability and rooting out waste by opening their books for public scrutiny ahead of the deadline. This includes publishing details of senior pay, councillor expenses, minutes of meetings, and any useful frontline service data of interest to residents or entrepreneurs.

#### Removing parking restrictions from national planning policy

We trust councils and communities to know what is best for their local area and we are continuing to devolve greater powers to enable them to act on their own.

On 3 January in conjunction with the Secretary of State for the Department of Transport, we removed national planning guidance that required councils to limit the number of parking spaces allowed in new residential developments and to set higher parking charges to encourage use of other forms of transport. Councils and communities are now free to set parking policies that are the best fit for their local area and for residents. These changes to planning policy will allow councils to set competitive local parking charges to promote town centres and attract shoppers to the high street. Councils will also be able to decide the right number of parking spaces for new residential development, helping to alleviate the problems of on-street parking congestion.

The Government recognises that for many people cars are a lifeline and we want to make it easier for motorists to make greener choices. Alongside steps already taken by the Department for Transport, we also outlined more support for drivers of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. On 3 January, we announced our intention to allow charging points to be built on streets and in outdoor car parks without the need for planning permission, removing bureaucracy and ensuring that making a green choice does not mean making a less convenient choice. We have also urged councils to follow this lead and promote electric vehicle charging points in new developments.

#### Delivering Services

The combination of severe snow and the festive break created a major headache for many councils and I pay tribute to the refuse collectors and other staff that have braved severe conditions to make their rounds. Nonetheless it is clear that there has been widespread public concern at the extent of the disruption to collections in some Local Authority areas. On 4 January my ministerial colleague, the Parliamentary Under Secretary for Local Government, wrote to all council leaders to stress the importance of delivering high quality waste and recycling services that meet local needs. The Government stands ready to work with the Local Government Association councils and DEFRA to ensure this happens.

#### Predetermination

Councillors play a vial role in the local community and they should be free to be able to act in the best interest of the people they are elected to serve. On 4 January the Department highlighted the restrictions placed upon them under so called 'predetermination' rules, preventing them taking part in decision on which they have campaigned or expressed a predisposed view. Under a measure contained in the Localism Bill these restrictions will be amended to give councillors the powers to champion the needs of local residents.

#### Delivering more homes

On 5 January my ministerial colleague, the Minister of State for Housing, set out our intention to develop an action plan to boost the number of self-builders across the country - and address the common barriers aspiring self-builders face, including availability of land, finance and expert advice. The self-build sector is already important to growth and housing supply - with self-builders completing as many as 10,000 building projects each year - so making it easier for more people to build their own home will provide a welcome boost to the housing market.

On 7 January I introduced new safeguards to restrict the use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders. These heavy handed rules, which were introduced in 2006, mean people who leave their house empty for more than six months risk having it confiscated. Homes at risk do not have to be blighted or boarded up, and can be taken over even if they are already on the property market, if councils believe the asking price is ""unrealistic"".

I am concerned that there is a risk that councils could use the Orders inappropriately to instigate action against homeowners in vulnerable situations. It is wrong that a bereaved family could face having their loved one's home taken over for a period if there is a delay in them deciding what to do with it.

So I am limiting use of the Orders to empty properties that have become magnets for vandalism, squatters and other forms of anti-social behaviour. A property will also have to stand empty for at least two years before an Order can be obtained, and property owners will have to be given at least three months notice before the Order can be issued. These new safeguards will ensure that responsible homeowners do not face having their properties seized.",eric-pickles,Secretary of State,Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government,http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/ericpickles,,written-statement,10-Jan-2011,,,,,,,eric-pickles,,,,,department-for-communities-and-local-government
http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2064778,DCLG's work during the Christmas recess 2011,"* * *

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr Eric Pickles): I would like to update Hon. Members on the main items of business undertaken by my Department since the House rose for Christmas Recess on 20 December 2011.

### Community Budgets

Decentralisation of funding and ensuring greater value for taxpayers' money are key goals for my Department. On 21 December 2011, my Department announced fourteen new Community Budget areas that will be able to combine resources into a locally coordinated funding pot with greater local control that will help improve services for local people.

Four 'whole place' pilots will create a joint team with local partners to establish devolved budget proposals with decision making structures for a locally run operation during this year. This will help achieve significant public sector savings, cut red tape and improve policy making.

Ten 'neighbourhood level' areas have also been selected to develop smaller scale Community Budgets that will give residents a micro-local level say over the services they want and use. The local community will play a leading role, working with councils and professionals, to shape local services so they work from a customer's perspective.

### Council reserves

Reflecting our commitment to greater local government transparency, on 29 December 2011, my Department published detailed figures for council budget reserves based on Revenue Budget forecast returns for 2011-12 provided by local authorities. Overall, English local authorities expect to be holding £10.8 billion in reserves on 31 March 2012. Their forecasts a year ago on 31 March 2011 totalled £11 billion.

Determining the level and use of reserves is a matter for individual local authorities, taking into account local challenges and priorities. However this demonstrates many councils have room for manoeuvre with their finances that can help them deliver more efficient local services in future years.

### Local audit arrangements

Following the decision to abolish the Audit Commission, the Government sought views last year on a new, more transparent and accountable local public audit framework that would reduce the cost of public audit and maintain high standards of scrutiny over public money.

On 4 January 2012, my Department published proposals for its next steps for the audit of local public bodies. The new framework will free local bodies to appoint their own independent auditors from an open and competitive market. It will be based on the private sector audit model with transparent regulation overseen by the Financial Reporting Council and the National Audit Office. Separate arrangements will be developed for smaller bodies like parish councils.

The Government intends to bring forward legislation to formally close down the Audit Commission and introduce the new framework as soon as Parliamentary time allows. A draft Bill will be published for pre-legislative scrutiny in the spring.

### Supporting home ownership

In November 2011, my Department published an ambitious housing strategy to tackle the housing shortage, boost the economy, create jobs and give people the opportunity to get on the housing ladder.

The Housing Strategy included an announcement of our plans to increase the Right to Buy. Right to Buy can promote opportunity and boost social mobility for social housing tenants but restrictions on discounts in recent years have limited the impact of the scheme. To ensure that there is no reduction in the supply of affordable homes any additional home bought under the Right to Buy will, for the first time, lead directly to the provision of a new affordable home for rent on a one-to-one basis. On 22 December 2011 the Department published our proposals to increase the discount cap under the Right to Buy scheme to £50,000, making it easier for social tenants to buy their homes.

Also on 22 December 2011, my Department announced further details of the £420 million Get Britain Building fund. The Fund will help builders with planning permission get back onto housing sites that have been shut down because of problems accessing development finance. Over the next two years, this £420 million fund is expected to unlock up to 16,000 homes on sites that are currently stalled, and help create up to 30,000 jobs in construction and related industries.

The Government wants to see investment and support right across the housing sector to improve the rental market and opportunities for homeownership. On 23 December 2011, my Department confirmed that Sir Adrian Montague will lead a review of barriers to investment in rented homes. The review will examine how best to encourage greater investment in rental properties - helping support the rapid growth of the private rented sector by increasing the supply of affordable homes.

### Social housing

On 5 January 2012, my Department published new allocations guidance for consultation that will release councils and housing associations from the shackles of the current tick-box approach for allocating social homes.

The new freedoms will ensure councils and housing associations can reward achievement and encourage housing mobility - so scarce and precious social homes go to people who genuinely need and deserve them the most, such as hard working families and ex-servicemen and women.

At the same time, housing providers will be able to tackle the tenants who are able to work but do not take up opportunities for jobs. For too long there has been a sense of unfairness over who gets to live in social housing, with a common belief that tenancies only go to those who know how to play the system.

Several councils have already indicated they want to introduce a new flexible approach to manage allocations - Westminster, Southend and Manchester councils will prioritise those who show responsibility and make an effort to find work, and in Wandsworth those tenants on new flexible contracts who do not make an effort to find work will risk losing their tenancy.

### Homelessness

On 21 December 2011, my Department announced an additional £20 million to provide single people facing homelessness more housing options to ensure they do not have to spend time on the streets. This funding is in addition to the £400 million Preventing Homelessness Grant.

A new programme will also be introduced to help local authorities improve their homelessness prevention process for single people.

£8 million from the Homelessness Transition Fund, which was set up to help support the national rough sleeping strategy, has been allocated to 19 communities across England to support a national roll out of London flagship 'No Second Night Out'. The initiative works with local communities to help provide the accommodation and support for rough sleepers.

### Helping the elderly

On 3 January 2012, the Department for Health announced a one-off additional £150 million will be allocated to Primary Care Trusts in England, for immediate transfer to local authorities for investment in social care services which also benefit the health system. For those needing adaptations to their homes, the Government has confirmed an additional £20 million for Disabled Facilities Grants - bringing the total to £200 million for 2011-12 alone.

We are also providing £51 million towards Home Improvement Agencies, who will provide help and advice including:

  * housing advice, including help to move to more suitable accommodation if needed
  * handyperson services, including small home repairs, home safety and security adaptations
  * energy efficiency advice; and
  * arranging for adaptations and home repairs to be made, including grab rails, stair-lifts and major work such as ground floor extensions.

These agencies also offer hospital discharge services - ensuring older people leaving hospital care are given the support they need to be able to recuperate in the comfort of their own homes.

We are also providing £1.5 million funding for FirstStop, which provides independent advice to older people looking to plan their future housing needs - whether in their own homes, or in care homes. This is in addition to work already underway to look at new and innovative ways in which elderly people can fund their future care needs without having to resort to selling their property.

### Traveller sites

On 7 January 2012, my Department announced the successful outcome of bids for £60 million of funding that will provide new authorised pitches and better facilities for travellers on official sites. The Homes and Communities Agency have completed their assessment of bids and have recommended offers that will deliver over 750 new and improved pitches at a cost of £47 million. The remaining fund will continue to be considered and the Agency will help those who did not see their bids approved to resubmit improved offers.

This support for official traveller pitches goes hand in hand with action against unauthorised traveller sites. Through the Localism Act, the Government is introducing stronger powers for councils to tackle the abuse of retrospective planning permission. These strengthened powers are helping councils tackle any form of unauthorised development. The new authorised travellers' sites will provide help to reduce the number of unauthorised sites, which create tensions between travellers and the settled community.

The last Government's approach was ineffective because traveller site funding was allocated but often remained unspent. By imposing top-down targets for traveller sites, local councils were compelled to encroach onto the Green Belt and open countryside, harming community relations and further leading to an increase in the number of unauthorised sites.

### Flag flying regulations

On 6 January 2012, my Department set out proposals to allow a much wider range of flags to be flown without the need for planning permission. Under current planning rules, only a select group of flags can be flown without express permission from councils and a fee of up to £335. Under the new rules, people will be able to fly a much wider range of flags including the flags of football and cricket teams or towns and villages. It will also allow communities to show support for our armed forces by easing rules on flying local regimental flags.

If people want to celebrate something that is important to them by flying a flag they should be able to do so without having to fill in forms or paying town hall officials for the privilege. This will make it easier for people to celebrate their allegiance to a cause, a county or a local organisation if they choose to do so.

_Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version._

### Introduction

Today I want to launch a new type of talent show. It's not the _X Factor_, _Britain's Got Talent_ or even _Strictly_. I'm calling it 'Your Community Needs You'.

Why?

Because next year, on May 5th, around 31 million people will have the right to vote in local elections.

But for democracy to thrive, people need to see the point in voting.

So we need talented community champions to have their names on those ballot papers.

And I thought to myself, where better to launch this search for talent than right here in my constituency.

At the excellent Bishops Hatfield Girls' School - with this group of talented young people and their equally talented parents.

I know that you've been working hard on school projects to make a difference - campaigning for a rural bus, supporting our local hospital and even something as small, but as important, as redecorating the school toilets!

I think I'm right in saying the parents are getting roped in too!

I'm really pleased that some of you are getting involved as youth councillors.

That is the sort of talent, the kind of get-up-and-go attitude that we also need from people standing for election as your local Councillors.

### School gate mums and dads

I've spotted this talent in the mums and dads who meet at the school gate, not just here but across the country.

Yes, they spend time chatting and socialising - or even grabbing a quick coffee.

But they're finding out what's going on.

Discussing what needs doing.

And then they go do it.

They throw themselves into getting their friends and neighbours to help run school events.

They organise the PTA, volunteer as Governors, run the after school clubs and share the school run.

And they're networked like never before.

Savvy about using the new technology.

They BBM on their Blackberries, text, and organise themselves using Facebook.

Keeping everyone up to date on what's going on.

Juggling competing priorities, and working together to solve complex logistical problems.

Or to put it another way - and, in technical terms, they make sure their kids are in the right place at the right time.

But on top of that, they're often the local activists - at the heart of their communities.

If a school fete needs organising, or the football team need transport - they sort it.

They have energy.

And passion.

They're exactly the sort of people the country need to become councillors.

Not a 'Dads Army' but a new army of mums and dads who get things done.

### Role of councillors

But I suspect for many school gate mums and dads becoming a councillor is the last thing on their minds.

And I don't blame them.

They might want things to change in their community but becoming a politician? Come off it!

Aren't politicians all the same - more interested in political point scoring than in their community.

Telling people what the other lot haven't done rather than making things happen themselves.

Actually, sadly, I think that this has all too often been true.

Politics has become a turn off.

But that's a real shame as I think we should, in theory, hold our local Councillors in high esteem.

After all, they're the foundation of our democracy.

They volunteer to do a really tough job with little reward and usually little thanks either.

Indeed most people, and by this I do quite literally mean the majority, don't even bother to vote for them.

Now for all this to change - for our democracy to work better - voting needs to make a difference.

So, why hasn't it made a difference in the past? Because Councillors have been tied down by red tape. Held back by Whitehall bureaucracy. Stuck in meaningless meetings, countless committees, senseless scrutiny panels and the silly standard boards.

Being a Councillor is a pretty thankless task that sapped the energy, passion and enthusiasm out of even committed people.

There has been a steady erosion of power of ward councillors over the years and I am, truly, full of admiration for the Councillors who have struggled on.

The best have continued to champion their communities despite all the odds.

### New world

Well, the times they are a changing.

In the last six months a quiet revolution has been taking place in Town and City Halls across the country.

The new Coalition Government is shedding power.

From Whitehall to your Town Hall.

From Downing Street to your street.

And now radical legislation - the Localism Bill - to be published shortly, will put councillors at the heart of their communities.

They will have more clout than ever before to get things done for the people they serve. 

In the past if people voted for you because, for example, you opposed a new development, you couldn't represent their views when it was discussed by the Council.

Why? Because you'd had the audacity to express an opinion about the new development and under some crazy rules you excluded yourself from making a decision.

That's not only barmy its anti-democratic.

This bonkers rule was called 'pre-determination' and we're determined to scrap it.

We're also abolishing the discredited Standards Boards. They fuelled petty and malicious complaints against councillors.

And we'll allow councils, if they wish, to return to the Committee system of local government.

This can mean more councillors being involved in decision-making.

We're giving Councillors and communities more freedom to decide how to spend the people's cash.

In some areas, like here in Welwyn Hatfield, Councillors are given control over local budgets to spend. Really good.

But in other areas they are going even further.

Neighbourhood control of budgets will give Councillors a central role in helping people decide on funding for a whole range of local public services.

Whether that's local policing, community health, how we look after families with multiple problems, or creating local jobs.

The whole shebang will be up for grabs.

### Councillor call-up

So becoming a Councillor is going to become more important than ever before.

That's why I'm launching 'Your Community Needs You'.

I know there are lots of talented people already playing their part getting things done across the country - school mums and dads are just one example.

So lots of people should audition.

People who are active in their church, or in their temple, mosque or synagogue.

People who run local charities, or sports clubs.

People with disabilities running a local self-help group.

Residents who are building the big society even when life's an uphill battle.

They all have talent, practical experience and a sense of civic responsibility.

Not to mention the passion and, yes, sometimes the anger to get things done.

And I'd like them to think about becoming local councillors too.

You may be thinking, yes, that's for me but what's the first step?

It's simple - just go online and google ""How to be a Councillor"".

You will quickly find the 'Be a Councillor' website created by the Local Government Association.

It contains all the info you need.

And if you succeed you will be able to change things.

That playground at the end of the street that needs new equipment.

That bus service that should run, but doesn't.

The youth services that could be improved.

The bin collections that get your blood boiling.

And there are even bigger things that you may be able to influence.

If you think the neighbourhood needs more housing, better shops, or a community centre then you will be involved in making the decisions.

Under our Localism Bill neighbourhoods will be in charge of their own plans.

I know this talent show might be less glamorous than the _X factor_ but if you win, you will be able to make real changes to real lives.

### Conclusion

And to be honest, over the years, I have been doing some early talent scouting for 'Your Community Needs You'.

As a local politician I knock on hundreds of doors and meet thousands of people.

And often they're passionate about what's happening to their community.

Sometimes, I come across people who I think would make brilliant local councillors.

And I'll suggest that they consider standing for election.

Usually they look at me as if I'm mad.

But when I knocked on Fiona Thomson's front door a few years back I made that suggestion.

And she took my advice.

Fiona is now an outstanding local councillor right here in Welwyn Hatfield. And she's here today.

She's a school mum - perhaps not the sort of person who usually gets elected as a councillor.

But Fiona's the sort of talented individual we need.

She's great at keeping in touch with people.

Being a community champion.

And we need more Fionas.

That is why I am here today and why I'm going on MumsNet later.

If you do decide to take the stage, it will be a tough competition.

There are already many talented councillors out there.

The electorate will be asked to cast their votes next May.

But the auditions for 'Your Community Needs You' begin today.

Please apply.

_Transcript of the speech as delivered._

I'd just like to start by saying thank you very much to Paul for that introduction, and to you all for being here today.

It hardly seems possible that it's over a year since I was last standing on this stage, on that occasion at a UK Green Building Council conference.

But a lot has changed since then.

I shadowed all four of those housing ministers back when I was in opposition. And today I am the Minister for Housing.

Back then we could only guess at the true size of the deficit. Now we face the reality of implementing the hard decisions needed to avert a Sovereign debt crisis that could have made what happened in Greece and Ireland look like a tea party.

But some things haven't changed at all.

The urgent need to slash Co2 emissions remains as pressing today as it did then. So our determination to act is unwavering.

I can recall standing here and saying that we'd like to nail the definition of a Zero Carbon home quickly if we won the election.

However in the event it's been industry who have asked for a little more time and for more research to be done to get a workable definition in place.

The commitment to Zero Carbon remains in place - there's no ambiguity about that. But I understand the need to make sure that this is an approach which we can all sign up to and one that works in the real world.

We've already cracked energy efficiency - and that's a big piece of the jigsaw completed.

And the Zero Carbon Hub has been working tirelessly in recent months to look again at what can be done on-site, thereby putting that second big bit of the jigsaw in place.

This is work for which many organisations here today should be thanked for all their time, effort and energy. And I'd like to say a big thank you from Government for that today.

I've seen the initial findings. Actually it seems that Building Magazine thought them exciting enough to share with everybody!

I must admit I've been surprised about some of what has been said, especially about the potential shortfall between design and performance. But I strongly welcome the willingness of industry to address this and move towards delivering performance as built, not just as designed.

But there is still another big piece of the jigsaw for us to put in place - the so called Allowable Solutions that we were just talking about.

The challenge remains - how to deliver an approach that works for everyone.

But I am not going to provide a blueprint to you to make that a done deal. This is not a case of Government delivering the solution.

Industry are the ones who know what works. My challenge to you is to come up with an approach to ""Allowable Solutions"" which delivers real, additional carbon savings in a cost-effective manner. A workable allowable solution.

For my part, I want to be putting the framework in place to make Allowable Solutions work.

I have heard and responded to the interest in Community Energy Funds, and I have previously said I would be looking closely at how these could work for everyone - for the environment, for Local Authorities, for industry, for the residents who will be living in these new homes.

The recent introduction of the Community Infrastructure Levy (or CIL), means we now have a vehicle which local authorities can use to raise funds for local renewable energy projects. And we're looking through legislation at how we can make CIL work even better, which strikes me as a positive step.

But it's about more than funding. It's about putting the tools to fight climate change in the hands of local people.

But building new green homes isn't enough.

We need to deal with all the existing houses too.

When it comes to slashing the 27 per cent of Co2 that comes from existing homes the Energy Bill currently going through Parliament will be a big help.

That bill proposes the 'Green Deal'. It provides proper incentives for people to insulate their homes, secure in the knowledge that it will lead to lower fuel bills.

The idea is that a Green Deal Provider will pay for the energy efficiency measures up front and the home owner or occupier repays those costs through their energy bills over time.

Whilst overall the person paying the bills will save money and CO2 will be reduced.

Whilst the Green Deal is currently only a retrofit scheme for existing homes, today I want to let you know that I am interested in whether we should look at new build homes too.

It was the UK Green Building Council who first raised this idea in their report on Pay as You Save back in 2009. They saw how you could take the principles we have built the Green Deal on - and apply these for new homes.

I reckon such a scheme could allow developers to recover some of the cost of building better homes to meet modern energy efficiency standards.

At the same time we could protect the home buyer by ensuring that their repayment was no more than the savings made on their energy bills. It seems to me that this could be a win win.

But I want to know what you think as an industry.

I'm keen to work with you to look at how we can make a reality of this idea.

This is my next big challenge to you.

I'd like to invite you to come up with a system which is fair and works both for developers and home buyers.

I've been very impressed by the work of the Zero Carbon Hub; I was a big supporter while I was in opposition and even more so in Government. So I'm delighted that industry will continue to support your important work.

I wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to the NHBC, and to others for their support. That's one of the reasons I came here today.

You're leading from the front together.

So that we can now say that zero carbon homes by 2016 is not just an abstract theoretical goal, but that new homes really will be zero net contributors to Co2 in reality too.
