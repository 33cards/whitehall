http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1626475,£1 billion fund to help regional business,"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today launched a £1 billion Regional Growth Fund to help areas and communities at risk of being particularly affected by public spending cuts. The fund, which will operate in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 will help areas most dependent on public sector employment as the country makes the transition to private sector-led growth and prosperity. Both private bodies and public-private partnerships will be able to bid for funding by demonstrating that their proposal will bring in private investment and support sustainable increases in private sector jobs and growth in their area.

Speaking in Bradford after the first Coalition Cabinet meeting outside of London today, Nick Clegg said:

> ""While we sort out the nation's finances we can also help to foster a thriving and more balanced economy so that no region or community gets left behind.
> 
> ""The Regional Growth Fund will create the conditions for growth and enterprise in the regions by stimulating investment and create sustainable private sector jobs.
> 
> ""Alongside our commitment to waive some employment taxes for new businesses starting up in targeted regions of the country, this fund can make a real difference to companies during difficult times.""

Nick Clegg also set out plans for Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) that will bring together councils and business on an equal footing with one voice, replacing the current Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). In a joint letter sent to councils and business leaders today, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles have asked them to consider forming new local enterprise partnerships that can provide strategic leadership in their local areas and create the right environment for business success and economic growth. 

Vince Cable, the Business Secretary said:

> ""We are determined to rebalance the economy towards the private sector, so it's important we create a more effective structure to drive economic growth and development across the country.
> 
> ""We want a structure that reflects the genuine interests and commitment of enterprise, local councils and other stakeholders like universities and colleges. Local enterprise partnerships will provide that vision and then take on the task of renewing local economies and tackling local barriers to growth. Today we are asking them to tell us about their vision and I'm looking forward to what they've got to say.""

Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary said:

> ""If you want to rebuild a fragile national economy you don't strangle business with red tape and let bloated regional quangos make all the decisions. Urgent action is needed to rebuild and rebalance local economies so that new businesses and economic opportunities spread across the country.
> 
> ""The solution needs to be local - we know that when councils and local business work hand in hand they can drive economic growth together and places can be transformed. Local enterprise partnerships are central to this vision which is why we are asking them what they need.
> 
> ""By giving up central control we will put democratic accountability back into the local economy making it responsive to the needs of local business and local people.""

Local Enterprise Partnerships will tackle issues including planning and housing, local transport and infrastructure, employment, enterprise and supporting business start-ups. Other roles currently carried out by the RDAs will be led nationally, such as inward investment, sector leadership, business support, innovation and access to finance.

Further details of the Regional Growth Fund, and the creation of LEPs, will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper on local and regional growth.

Alongside this, Ministers also today announced plans for a Green Paper on business finance. As part of the government's strategy to encourage investment in growing companies in areas overly dependent on public sector employment, the Green Paper will consider the evidence, and identify any barriers to the supply of finance in such areas. It will consider whether more can be done to encourage bank finance, and also look at other possible sources of finance - such as growth capital and equity finance. The paper will also consider the role for local stock exchanges, and whether concerns about lack of liquidity and diversification can be overcome.

### Notes to Editors

1. Full details of the Regional Growth Fund, including who will be eligible to apply, and the criteria and process for assessing bids, will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper on local and regional growth.

2. Budget 2010 announced:

> The Government will shortly announce details of a scheme to help new businesses in targeted areas of the UK that need it most. During a three year qualifying period, new businesses which start up in these areas will get a substantial reduction in their employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs). Within the qualifying period, these employers will not have to pay the first £5,000 of Class 1 employer NICs due in the first twelve months of employment. This will apply for each of the first 10 employees hired in the first year of business and operate in selected countries and regions. Subject to meeting the necessary legal requirements, the scheme is intended to start no later than September 2010. Any new business set up from 22 June 2010 which meets the criteria set out in the forthcoming announcement will benefit from the scheme; and to help areas and communities particularly affected by reductions in public spending make the transition to private sector-led growth and prosperity, the Government will create a Regional Growth Fund in 2011-12 and 2012-13. This Fund will operate in England only and support increases in business employment and growth. The Devolved Administrations will be encouraged to undertake similar action.

3. The Government's Coalition Programme states: ""We will support the creation of local enterprise partnerships - joint local authority-business bodies brought forward by local authorities themselves to promote local economic development - to replace Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). These may take the form of the existing RDAs in areas where they are popular.""

4. Local enterprise partnerships will tackle issues including planning and housing, local transport and infrastructure, employment, enterprise and supporting business start-ups. Other roles currently carried out by the RDAs will be led nationally, such as inward investment, sector leadership, business support, innovation and access to finance.

5. The Government is determined that the transition from RDAs to Local Enterprise Partnerships will be orderly, working to a clear timetable. Legislation to abolish them was announced in the Queen's Speech and is expected to be introduced to Parliament in the autumn.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2030149,£1.5 million fund to help the Gurkha community settle in the UK,"Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, and Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today (15 November 2011) announced £1.5m of additional Government funding to support the successful integration of retired Gurkha soldiers and their dependants, who having served in the British Army, now wish to apply for settlement in the UK.

A fund of £1.5m - to be paid over two years - will help ease the exceptional pressures on Rushmoor Borough Council, Hampshire which has seen a large number of Gurkha ex-servicemen and their dependents arrive in the towns of Aldershot and Farnborough over a relatively short period of time. The recent arrivals include a high proportion of children and elderly Nepalese nationals which has placed a recognised strain on local social, health and education services.

The £1.5m fund over two years will be used to:

  * address the immediate resource pressures on Rushmoor Borough Council and provide a source of funding for managing further pressures over the next two years and;
  * support other local authorities with large numbers of retired Gurkhas to manage future integration of retired veterans and their families who wish to take up their settlement rights.

The Government will now work with the Gurkha Welfare Trust, other service organisations and charities, relevant local authorities with existing Gurkha populations, the Gurkha Settlement Office in Nepal to see how we can use the fund most effectively to encourage more manageable future migration and integration.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said:

> ""I was proud to be a part of the hard fought campaign for equal rights and citizenship for Gurkhas. But honouring the bravery of the Gurkhas, who have served this country's armed forces for almost 200 years, doesn't end there. This fund is a vital part of ensuring that their families are welcomed and supported in communities so they can live with the respect that they deserve.""

Eric Pickles said:

> ""These brave British army veterans have given our country loyal service over many years. It is their bravery that has helped protect our way of life and our traditions and it is right that their dedication is honoured.
> 
> ""Many of these ex-servicemen and their families have been proud to call this country their home and we too are proud of the strong ties that have been established between the ex-Gurkhas, their families and their wider communities. We are determined that if they chose to settle in the UK to see that they and their families are treated with dignity and respect and are made to feel welcome.""

### Note to editors

  1. Parliament has decided that retired Gurkhas who served between 1948 and 1997 would be able to apply to settle in the UK with their families.
  2. The funding of £1.5m fund over two years has been agreed between Communities and Local Government, Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. Each department will contribute £500,000.
  3. Rushmoor Borough Council have estimated between 6,000 and 12,000 people of Nepalese origin live in the area; the official population of the council area is just over 90,000. This group has an unusual demographic, with large proportions of older people and children. This has increased pressure on social, health and education services (over 7 per cent of school children have Nepali as their first language).
  4. There remain approximately 25,000 retired Gurkhas eligible to apply for settlement in the UK.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2144581,£10 million investment to connect Northampton enterprise zone,"Today Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Justine Greening announced a £10 million boost for transport infrastructure in Northampton's Enterprise Zone.

The money is being invested in the development of the Castle Railway Station at the heart of Northampton Enterprise Zone. The new station will provide vital infrastructure capacity to support local plans for sustainable economic growth.

The Northampton Enterprise Zone is building on the areas strengths in advanced technologies, high performance engineering, and low carbon technology. With access to super fast broadband, up to 100 per cent business rates discounts and simplified planning process the Zone is already attracting big business hitters like Carlsberg, providing more jobs and boosting the local economy.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Northampton is using its Enterprise Zone to energise the local economy and boost business. As these new opportunities for innovation and enterprise open up it is vital the infrastructure is in place to match Northampton's ambitions.
> 
> ""This £10 million for the Castle Railway station is another step forward in Northampton's resurgence as a place where local communities thrive.""

Communities Minster Andrew Stunell added:

> ""Improving the transport links to this ambitious area will help Northampton to unleash its potential as a centre for local growth and innovation.
> 
> ""Turning Castle Station into a key transport hub at the heart of the Enterprise Zone is just one more reason for business to invest in this area and bring new jobs and homes that will benefit the whole community.""

Together with funding from Network Rail and Northamptonshire County Council the Government's contribution will go towards phase one of the redevelopment scheme which includes a new station building and access to the platforms, which will be a major improvement for residents and visitors to the area.

The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, the agency driving regeneration in West Northamptonshire, can now look at how they can take forward subsequent phases of the redevelopment which will include a new larger car park and release of land for commercial opportunities close to the station.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2079220,£1 billion cash boost for pro-growth communities,"Communities with ambitions for economic growth have today been rewarded with a cash boost of nearly £1billion to get their projects off the ground and improve their local areas.

Today's announcement forms part of a wider package of measures announced by Housing Minister Grant Shapps, highlighting the vital and central role that housing is playing in getting the country's economy on the road to recovery.

Ministers have confirmed the allocation of the £500milllion Growing Places Fund, designed to boost economic growth by getting the required infrastructure built to enable the creation of new homes and jobs and get stalled projects moving again.

The funding has been allocated to the country's 38 Local Enterprise Partnerships, who will now decide what to prioritise locally.

The fund can be used to establish revolving funds to take forward a range of projects that can help boost economic growth, as Local Enterprise Partnerships offer funding to developers, but also secure a return on that investment.

In addition, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has confirmed a cash boost to 353 councils, who will receive a share of £432million New Homes Bonus funding after delivering 159,000 homes last year - and from a second round of payments for homes built the year before.

This year's payment includes the first premium for affordable homes - totalling £20million.

Whether regenerating the town centre, reinvigorating treasured local assets or reinvesting in local services and enterprise, councils and communities will work together to decide how best to spend their New Homes Bonus.

Taken together, the allocations of the Growing Places and New Homes Bonus funding totals nearly £1billion.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today's announcement represents a massive cash boost of nearly £1billion to communities with a track record of going for growth, and with ambition to go even further.
> 
> ""The Growing Places Fund will unlock further sites for development, creating new jobs in those areas, while the New Homes Bonus recognises the efforts that have been made over the last year to deliver thousands of new homes and bring empty properties back into use.
> 
> ""I look forward to seeing how this significant investment will change the shape of communities across the country.""

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

> ""Transport provides the crucial links that allow people and businesses to prosper.
> 
> ""This investment will develop and improve the infrastructure that moves goods and people around helping to build the balanced, dynamic and sustainable economy that is needed for our future prosperity. Shovel-ready local transport projects like local roads and bridges can be essential to access new homes and new jobs.
> 
> ""The Fund is also a unique opportunity for Local Enterprise Partnerships to establish a rolling investment programme and leverage the private sector to continue to deliver future projects that maximise economic benefit.
> 
> ""Our vision is for a transport system that is not only an engine for economic growth but also one that is safer, more environmentally friendly and improves quality of life in our communities.""

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said:

> ""Today we are confirming the allocations of the half a billion pound Growing Places fund, which will make a real difference to local infrastructure across the country.
> 
> ""The flexible fix-it fund will invest in a variety of projects to boost the local economy. The local community, through the Local Enterprise Partnerships, will decide on the priority projects, ranging from building strategic link roads to reducing congestion.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2081203,£250 million fund to herald return of better weekly collections,"A fund of up to quarter of a billion pounds to help support councils to deliver better, more environmentally friendly weekly bin collections for residents is now open, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today, 3 February 2012.

In September last year the government announced its intention to introduce a new Weekly Collection Support Scheme for councils that retain or reinstate weekly residual waste and recycling services. The new Scheme will deliver benefits to the environment and taxpayers.

Ministers believe that waste services have become too complex, leaving residents anxious about following the rules and possible penalties. They think councils should focus on three things: better weekly collections, better contracts and better use of innovative ideas or technology that help residents to recycle more and do their bit for the environment.

The scheme is additional funding to local government, financed from savings made to the Department for Communities and Local Government's central budget.

The new fund will help support reward-schemes (for example, those like Windsor and Maidenhead's Recyclebank scheme and Birmingham's Nectar points scheme), where families are rewarded for recycling, delivering on a Coalition Agreement pledge.

It also explicitly intends to tackle 'bin blight' and the proliferation of bins, by supporting new technology where possible.

The fund will promote innovation, better procurement and joint working across local authorities. It intends to support a range of local initiatives to increase recycling and deliver weekly collections. It will seek to prioritise bids which support comprehensive weekly rubbish and recycling collections.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Rubbish collections are the most visible service that people get for their £120 a month council tax bill. But barmy bin rules have made putting out your rubbish more complicated than solving a Rubik's cube. The public are fed up of all the bin do's and bin don'ts.
> 
> ""People just want a comprehensive service in return for their council tax, which is why this Government is working with councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish and recycling collections.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said:

> ""We want to help people to go green by making it easier for them to do the right thing. This scheme will encourage councils to provide the services we believe residents really want, without sacrificing the environment.""

Matthew Farrow, the Environmental Services Association's Director of Policy, added:

> ""Waste management companies want to collect and manage waste in ways which are both user-friendly for the householder and benefit the environment. So we welcome the way in which the Fund prioritises environmental criteria and regular collections that meet the needs of householders.
> 
> ""We also support the encouragement given to local authorities to think innovatively and to work with the private sector. We look forward to working with their local authority customers to help them make best use of the opportunities the fund provides.""

### Notes to editors

1. The _Supporting Weekly Collections_ prospectus and bidding form for applicants can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/weeklycollectionsprospectus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/weeklycollectionsprospectus).

A wide range of councils have signalled their informal interest in the scheme since September. Today a prospectus _Supporting Weekly Collections_, explaining how to apply, is being published. Councils should submit an expression of interest by mid March, with initial bids sent in May and full bids by August. Funding bids will be evaluated on how well they meet three criteria:

  * delivering a weekly collection service to residents
  * delivering value for money
  * delivering improved environmental benefit

Councils will be able to bid individually or front bids with public and private sector delivery partners.

2. The Government announced in last June's Waste Review a series of measures to make life easier for the householder. It has already scrapped plans to introduce new bin taxes with provisions through the Localism Act; reversed Audit Commission guidance and inspections which marked down councils who do not adopt fortnightly rubbish collections; and abolished Local Area Agreements imposed by Whitehall which created perverse incentives to downgrade waste collection services.

3. The Government has committed to reducing waste and accelerating recycling rates by focusing on rewards incentives that encourage recycling. More details can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1608336](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1608336).

A Government scheme to encourage councils and other organisations to test out innovative reward and recognition schemes is now in place:  
[www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/consumer/reward-scheme/](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/consumer/reward-scheme/) (external link).

4. A consultation has been launched to stop council's imposing unfair 'bin fines' of up to £1,000 on households for breaches of confusing bin rules. The consultation, promised in the Waste Review, can be viewed here: [www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/01/16/bin-fines-consultation](http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/01/16/bin-fines-consultation) (external link).

5. A recent Sauce-Icaro Attitudes to Waste Survey found that Two thirds (67 per cent) agreed with the statement the Government should mandate weekly collections.  Weekly collections had higher satisfaction levels than fortnightly (83-74 per cent). Reports of problems with flies and smells for fortnightly collections was more that double that for weekly (14 per cent - 6 per cent).

6. The average Band D council tax bill in England is £1,439 a year (an average of £120 a month).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2099373,£250 million savings for local public bodies expected from Audit Commission outsourcing,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has welcomed today's announcement by the Audit Commission that hard-pressed councils and other local bodies should see big fee reductions following the successful outsourcing of the Commission's centralised audit practice.

Outsourcing is the next step to disbanding the Audit Commission and putting in place a new decentralised framework that will refocus audit on helping people hold their councils to account for local spending decisions. It should save £250 million over five-years, leading to fee reductions of around 40 per cent for local bodies. This will help councils in managing their budgets during this challenging period, and ensure the same high audit standards are maintained to safeguard public money.

Four firms are expected to win contracts, increasing the number of suppliers of local public audit from five to seven. This will help create more choice in the market ahead of local bodies appointing their own auditors. Other firms will have the opportunity to enter the market then too.

The contracts awarded by the Audit Commission will begin on 1 September 2012 and last for five years. The Government was happy to support the sector's preference for these big fee reductions to be locked in for five-years.

In the meantime, the Government is pressing ahead with its plans for disbanding the Audit Commission. A draft Bill will be published in the Spring for Parliamentary scrutiny. The legislation will be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows. The legislation will include arrangements that allow these contracts to continue after the Commission is abolished.

Staff at the Commission's in-house practice will transfer to the winning bidders on 31 October, leaving a small residual Commission to oversee the outsourced contracts until the Commission is abolished and the contracts transferred.

Mr Shapps said:

> ""Today marks another step on the road to replacing the Audit Commission with a more streamlined and competitive local audit system that increases town-hall transparency and the accountability of councils to local citizens.
> 
> ""The potential savings of £250 million with 40 per cent fee reductions for councils show that our decision to outsource the Audit Commission's in-house practice was the right one.""

Sir Merrick Cockell, Chairman of the Local Government Association, said:

> ""The Local Government Association would like to see councils themselves procuring their audit services and we have been working with Government to that end. In the current financial climate this next step towards that goal represents significant and guaranteed savings for five years and that is good news for local government. At a time when they are facing very hard decisions about budgets, this will be a tangible financial benefit to them.""

### Notes to editors

1. Around 11,000 local public bodies are audited under the Audit Commission's regime, including local government, health and police bodies, national parks authorities and passenger transport executives. Smaller bodies are handled separately from larger bodies.

2. The outsourcing announced today relates to the audits of larger bodies. The Audit Commission is running in parallel an outsourcing process for the audits of smaller bodies which fall under the limited assurance regime. There are around 9,900 such bodies, with audit work totalling around £2.9 million. The results of this outsourcing process will be announced in a month's time.

3. The contracts announced today cover around 70 per cent of the local public audit work for larger bodies, and have a value of £90 million per year, as expressed in terms of Audited Body Notional Value based on the proposed scale fees for 2012/13 and an estimated value for certification work. The other 30 per cent of the audit work for larger bodies is already outsourced.

4. The Audit Commission is proposing to award new contracts to four firms as a result of the current outsourcing: DA Partnership, Ernst and Young, Grant Thornton and KPMG. Grant Thornton and KPMG already have contracts in place with the Audit Commission, alongside Deloittes, PWC and PKF and these existing contracts will remain in place, so in total there will be seven firms that undertake the audits of larger public bodies. As a result of this outsourcing, it is expected that Grant Thornton will be the largest firm in this market.

5. Further details of the contract awards are available from the Audit Commission's website [www.audit-commission.gov.uk](http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk) (external link).

6. The outsourcing contracts will run for five years with the option to extend for an additional three years. A decision as to whether to extend the contracts will be taken nearer the time of expiry.

7. It remains the Government's intention to introduce the necessary legislation to abolish the Audit Commission as soon as Parliamentary time allows. It is the Government's current intention to transfer all rights and liabilities under the contracts in that proposed legislation, so that the contracts can run for their planned duration (even though the Commission will be disbanded in the meantime).

8. Outsourcing the Commission's in-house practice will mean that many of the Commission's audit staff will transfer with their work to the private sector under TUPE terms. The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 require that the terms and conditions of employees are protected on transfer.

9. In line with previous practice, the Commission have allowed for a significant period of consultation with local bodies prior to finalising appointments. This will begin imminently. The timetable means that appointments are planned by the start of the Annual Audit Cycle on 1 September 2012. In the meantime, the existing auditor who will be on-site undertaking the 2011/12 audits will keep a watching brief for the first six months of the new financial year.

10. The Government is currently developing the new local public audit framework that will replace the current arrangements, subject to legislation. Following the publication of the _Government Response to the Consultation on the Future of Local Audit_ on 4 January, we have undertaken comprehensive discussions with local public bodies and other key partners. These will inform the detail of the draft Bill to be published in the Spring.

11. The _Government Response to the Consultation on the Future of Local Audit_ is available on the DCLG website at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localauditgovresponse](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localauditgovresponse). The consultation ran from March-June 2011. Over 450 responses were received, mostly from local bodies and their representative bodies.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1730219,£390 million tax break for half a million small businesses,"From today over half a million businesses will, for one year, get double their usual Small Business Rate relief as the Government's budget promises to support local enterprise kick in.

The Government's emergency Budget set out plans to rebuild and rebalance local economies so that new businesses and economic opportunities spread across the country. The one-year reprieve from business rate bills will lighten the load for small companies, giving them more freedom to manage their accounts and grow.

A total of 530,000 small businesses with rateable values up to £12,000 will receive double their normal discount for one year, a move which is set to save them a total of £390 million. Approximately 345,000 of those businesses with rateable values up to £6,000 - will pay no rates at all. 

Bob Neill said:

> ""This tax cut will help small local shops on high streets across England.  Small firms are the lifeblood of local enterprise and the Government is committed to supporting them as we come out of recession.
> 
> ""Doubling their tax break for a year will give struggling companies a chance to get their finances on track, and help enterprising businesses to invest in their future and grow.""

The Government is committed to creating a more effective economic development system that can drive growth and maintain recovery. The establishment of local enterprise partnerships will support local economies by radically reshaping the way business and government interact at the local level. Further measures to encourage local entrepreneurs include a reduction in corporation tax, support for businesses on capital gains tax and an increase in support for small companies who want access to bank lending.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2118896,£420 million to support local infrastructure,"£420 million will be available through two routes to help communities deliver vital local infrastructure projects, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Justine Greening confirmed today.

Last week the Prime Minister gave a keynote speech where he set out a vision for this country's infrastructure in the 21st century. He described new infrastructure as 'the magic ingredient' to long term economic success.

An additional £270m is being made available through the Growing Places Fund. Less than a week after the Budget this money is being allocated to local enterprise partnerships giving them and the market greater confidence to invest. This builds on the £500 million already allocated.

The Growing Places Fund provides local areas with up-front and flexible funding so they can quickly boost economic growth by getting the required infrastructure built to build new homes, create jobs and get stalled projects moving again.

This includes £12 million for Greater Manchester; £11 million for Leeds City Region; £5 million for Hertfordshire; £6 million for Lancashire and almost £7 million for the Heart of the South West local enterprise partnership.

Up to £150 million will be available for large scale infrastructure projects in core cities. This money will be financed through a scheme known as Tax Increment Financing Type 2, which lets local authorities borrow against future growth in business rates for 25 years.

Further details on a competition for allocating funding will be announced in the spring.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""We know that new infrastructure is one of the most important ways to get the economy going again, support new homes and create long term jobs and growth. That is why last week Government made over £400 million more available to communities.
> 
> ""The extra Growing Places Fund money is available immediately so local enterprise partnerships can unlock sites for infrastructure development that support new homes and Tax Increment Finance will give councils the means to raise their own finances over the longer-term to back infrastructure projects themselves.""

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

> ""Transport infrastructure projects are often the key to unlocking jobs and growth potential, where new link roads or junction improvements can be a catalyst for investment in new regeneration sites of homes and businesses that otherwise might not happen. Feedback from the first round of our funding is that lots of projects are transport focused which is why I am delighted to provide £150 million from my Department towards the additional £270 million for the Growing Places Fund.""

1. Prime Minister's speech on infrastructure is available here: [www.number10.gov.uk/news/pm-speech-on-infrastructure/](http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/pm-speech-on-infrastructure/) (external link).

2. The Additional Growing Places Funding comes from various central Government department underspends. The government has written to local enterprise partnerships this week setting out the allocation for 2012-13 and beyond as follows:

_ 1£460 million of the original allocation went to local enterprise partnerships in England. The additional funding brings the total for England to £730 million. The remainder of the original allocation of £500 million was allocated to the Devolved Administrations._   
  


3. The Lancashire Local enterprise partnership has approved its first there schemes to receive £7 million. These three schemes - Luneside East commercial development in Lancaster, Burnley Bridge business park, Edge Hill University expansion in Ormskirk - are ready to start work immediately, providing transport infrastructure and land remediation works creating 1,550 new jobs, levering a further £95 million investment and creating 577 new homes.

4. Worcestershire Local enterprise partnership has allocated £3.25m of its Growing Places Fund to four schemes which will create over 500 new jobs and lever in over £20 million of other investment. These schemes include Hoo Brook Link Road and groundwork and utilities infrastructure at Worcester University Park and mixed use development around Worcestershire County Cricket ground.

5. The Local Government Finance Bill takes forward proposals designed to encourage local economic growth, reduce the financial deficit and drive decentralisation of control over local government finance. This includes allowing for authorities to retain in full the rates growth in designated Tax Increment Financing (TIF2) and Enterprise Zone areas. A brief guide to the bill can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/lgfinancebill/briefguide/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/lgfinancebill/briefguide/).

6. A first wave of city deals have already started with England's eight largest cities outside of London: Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield. These will give them the powers they need to attract private sector investment, create new jobs, and rebalance the economy.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2024671,£500 million fund to unlock the potential for economic growth,"Communities whose ambitions for economic growth have been stuck in the mud could benefit from a multi-million pound boost to help get their building projects off the ground.

The £500 million Growing Places Fund will be available to help boost economic growth by getting the required infrastructure built to enable the creation of new jobs and homes by getting stalled projects moving again.

The Fund will put local businesses and organisations in the driving seat, with the 38 Local Enterprise Partnerships able to apply for the funding and then take decisions about what to prioritise locally.

Councils will support these plans with their technical and financial expertise - leaving Local Enterprise Partnerships free of red tape and better able to focus their attentions on ensuring the funds go to where they will be used most effectively.

And to ensure work can start straight away to help get Britain building again, all £500 million will be allocated from the end of January 2012.

The Growing Places Fund can be used to establish revolving funds to take forward a range of projects that can help facilitate economic growth, jobs and housebuilding in the local area, providing returns which can be re-invested locally. Through this, Local Enterprise Partnerships will be able to offer secure funding to developers in their area, making it quicker for projects to get off the ground but also securing a return on that investment for the local area.

Types of projects could include:

  * early development of strategic link roads and access works to unlock major mixed-use developments, enabling the delivery of homes and commercial space - leading to the creation of jobs and securing private investment
  * provision of flood storage capacity to enable development of homes, employment space and  retail space; and
  * works to improve local connectivity and reduce congestion through interventions such as extending dual carriageways, enabling developments to be taken forward sustainably.

And today, Ministers have published indicative allocations of the £500 million Growing Places Fund to each of the 38 Local Enterprise Partnerships, including:

  * £12.9 million for the Liverpool City Region
  * £23.9 million for the Leeds City Region
  * £17.4 million for the Local Enterprise Partnership covering Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire
  * £14.9 million for Birmingham and Solihull
  * Nearly £40 million for London; and
  * £14.2 million for the Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The £500 million Growing Places Fund will unlock much-needed local infrastructure and get the homes we need built. It will be Local Enterprise Partnerships, made up of the people and businesses who know their local areas best, who will decide where this cash boost will be spent.
> 
> ""I now want to see these partnerships coming together and finding innovative ways to unlock local sites and help get Britain building again.""

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

> ""Transport is key to unlocking growth.
> 
> ""The Growing Places fund will let communities provide the transport links that get people and businesses from A to B.
> 
> ""This will be crucial in building the balanced and dynamic economy that is essential for our future prosperity.""

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said:

> ""The half a billion pound Growing Places fund will kick start local developments across the country.
> 
> ""This is a flexible fix-it fund that will make a real difference on the ground, improving the lives of local residents and boosting the local economy. From building strategic link roads to reducing congestion, the investment will set businesses free and create jobs.""

### Notes to editors

1. Details of how to apply for a share of the £500 million Growing Places Fund can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/growingplacesfund](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/growingplacesfund).

2. Below is a table of the provisional allocations of funding to the Local Enterprise Partnerships - Local Enterprise Partnerships will now submit proposals for their allocations, outlining how they plan to use the funding on local infrastructure projects.

  
  


Notes:

(1) Allocations do not sum to £450 million due to rounding. £50 million is to go to the Devolved Administrations.  
(2) Formula weighted distribution using district level data (2010), with Population and ""Employed Earnings"" (employment multiplied by earnings) given equal weighting;  
(3) Economic Development activity is devolved to the Mayor of London, and specific funding arrangements for transport and local economic development are already in place for this year. The entitlement for the London Local Enterprise Partnership is therefore restricted to money coming from the Reserve (£250 million in total, less £50 million entitlement for Devolved Administrations).  
(4) Where districts are in overlapping Local Enterprise Partnerships, the entitlement as a result of that district is split equally between those Local Enterprise Partnerships.  
(5) An allocation has been set aside to allow for any districts yet to join a Local Enterprise Partnership.  
*Subject to Ministerial approval of Local Enterprise Partnership proposal.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1848926,"£5 million boost for Church to deliver stronger, more integrated communities","The Church Urban Fund has welcomed a boost of £5 million for an initiative that will bring people of different faiths together - to collaborate on projects to improve their neighbourhood and get to know each other better.

The three year programme, called Near Neighbours, will offer small grants to communities that have bright ideas for local inter faith projects. A wide range of community, education, environmental, arts, and sports activities will be eligible, as long as they encourage involvement by local people from different faiths or none.

Near Neighbours taps into the unique Church of England parish system which has presence in all neighbourhoods and an ethos as the national Church, with a responsibility towards all in the parish, as well as the Church's decades of experience in funding community projects in deprived areas.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Religious organisations play an enormous pastoral role in our neighbourhoods and have excellent networks within our communities - none more so than the Church of England. They have been getting on with their work for centuries - offering support to youth groups, parents and pensioners and providing services to those in need.
> 
> ""Near Neighbours will build on this and bring folks from different backgrounds together for the good of the community - be it a sports event or working together to improve a local park, it will mean meeting your neighbours and getting on.
> 
> ""There are very few faith groups that don't look beyond their own faith and congregation to put something back into the community that surrounds them, so this project will build on that and I encourage people to get involved.""

The Department for Communities and Local Government has awarded the funding to the Church Urban Fund to strengthen and expand its inter faith and community development work and help break down barriers between groups of people. Near Neighbours will be set up as a charity by the Church Urban Fund and Church of England.

Church Urban Fund's chief executive Tim Bissett said:

> ""We welcome the government's recognition of the vital role churches and faith-based organisations play in local communities. More than 20 years experience has shown us local people often hold the key to solving local problems. Church Urban Fund is already working in these communities and will also use the Church's existing strong relationships and infrastructure to make this idea a reality.
> 
> ""We're also excited by the opportunities this grant presents for us to work alongside committed people from all faiths to bring about much-needed change in some of England's most diverse areas.""

Near Neighbours will start operating later in 2011 in locations in the M62 ""mill towns"" corridor, Leicester, East London and Birmingham, drawing on the resources of local churches long established in all the neighbourhoods in these areas.

The Church Urban Fund will deliver Near Neighbours in partnership with other bodies, such as the two below.

The Feast organises work in schools in the multi-religious Sparkhill and Aston areas of Birmingham, with the aim of developing better relationships between young people of Christian and Muslim faiths. Schools outreach workers build on initial encounter sessions with longer-term events that create a safe, trusting environment in which teenagers can share their faith experiences, gain a better understanding of each other's lives and develop friendships.

The Nehemiah Foundation provides training and mentoring for people and organisations seeking to develop their communities. Their 18-month full time Community Regeneration programme involves participants working with a host organisation while they learn how to assess community needs, developing business plans, carrying out an audit of previous work in the area and measuring its impact, organising local support, and building networks for effective communication. The Foundation has links with various local bodies, allowing it to tap into a wide range of areas of expertise. The Near Neighbours project will use the Foundation's expertise to train community organisers.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2036718,£71 million to end the legacy of England's 'ghost streets',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced the allocation of more than £71 million to help families trapped in half-empty and abandoned streets, as a consequence of a controversial regeneration scheme introduced in 2002.

A new fund will help tackle the 'ghost streets' across the Midlands and the north of England left by the Housing Market Renewal Pathfinder programme. Introduced in 2002, the Whitehall programme led to the demolition and clearance of dilapidated streets across the country - but left thousands of families trapped in unsellable homes.

Visiting a former Housing Market Renewal area in Stoke, Mr Shapps announced that thirteen projects in the worst hit areas - Merseyside, East Lancashire, North Staffordshire, Hull and Teesside - will receive a cash injection to help their local communities.

These areas originally bid for a share of a £30 million fund that they would then match - but the minister said that an extra £5.5 million had been added to ensure that every street or block with more than half its properties lying vacant would feel the benefit. Ministers have abolished the central targets for demolition, and want local communities rather than Whitehall to have the final say on how to promote regeneration.

The money is being provided on the basis of pound-for-pound matching locally. Combining Government investment with local cash this will mean:

  * £7.2 million for Stoke-on-Trent areas, encompassing North Shelton, Etruria Valley and Fegg Hayes
  * £18.6 million for Easby, Wavertree, Anfield and Breckfield in Liverpool
  * £6.6 million for Ings, Newington and St Andrews in Hull
  * £4 million for St Hildas and Gresham in Middlesbrough
  * £4.6million for East and West Accrington in Hyndburn.

In addition to ending the Whitehall-imposed targets for demolishing homes, Ministers are taking a series of steps to get empty homes back into beneficial use, as outlined in the Government's Housing Strategy published on Monday 21 November 2011.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Under the previous controversial scheme, local communities in some of the most deprived areas of the country were told they would see a transformation of their areas. But in reality, this amounted to bulldozing buildings and knocking down neighbourhoods, pitting neighbour against neighbour, demolishing our Victorian heritage and leaving families trapped in abandoned streets. This programme was a failure and an abject lesson to policy makers.
> 
> ""The families in these half-empty ghost streets should not be left desperately hoping for someone to reorder the rubble. That's why I've been able to boost the cash we're committing to more than £35 million - matched by councils to bring the total to £71 million - to help councils and residents move on from this difficult past and can start realising the potential of their area.""

### Notes to editors

1. A full list of project allocations is below:

  
  


2. Allocations were calculated on the basis of criteria set out in the bidding guidance, which specifically asked authorities to identify those streets/blocks which were more than 50 per cent vacant. Local Authorities were also required to set out robust exit strategies from the HMR programme including plans for taking forward refurbishment options.

3. For full detail of individual exit strategies please contact the relevant local council.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1774367,100 councils open their spending to public scrutiny,"This week South Ribble Borough Council has become the one hundredth local authority to put its spending data over £500 online for armchair auditors to scrutinise.

The milestone comes on the day Whitehall meets its own promise to publish the first of its spending data above £25,000 online. DCLG has already started publishing all its spending over £500 (see links right).

Greater transparency is at the heart of the Government's shared commitment, spearheaded by the Prime Minister to enable the public to hold politicians and public bodies to account. This ambition will also let the public, journalists and campaign groups put the data to use in meaningful ways - from rooting out waste to finding innovative ways of working.

Web developers and app designers have already taken up the challenge, transforming Government data on into ingenious mobile phone or home computer applications to help people move house, choose a school or care home or even find their nearest postbox - making everyday local life that little bit easier.

Minister for Communities and Local Government, Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""We are entering a new era of openness and transparency where all parts of Governmentare making information readily available to the public.
> 
> ""So it is great to see that one hundred councils have now put their spending over £500 online. With just six weeks till the New Year I urge those that have not done so, to catch up with their peers as soon as possible.
> 
> ""We are already seeing how useful public data can be in everyday life, from moving home to choosing schools. The public have a right to see what their tax money is doing.""

Here some of the best sites and apps out there for budding Armchair Auditors:

**Openly Local** collates everything you could want to know about your local council on a single page, from spending details and meeting documents to elected councillors to local demographics. [openlylocal.com](http://openlylocal.com/) (external link).

**UK Post Bo**x is a mobile phone application that helps the user locate their nearest post box displayed as red post boxes on a map. It uses a dataset of all the registered Royal Mail post boxes in the United Kingdom to plot their location. It also displays the last collection time so people can catch the last post! [data.gov.uk/apps/ukpostbox](http://data.gov.uk/apps/ukpostbox) (external link).

**Pick My House** Looking for somewhere to live? Just by browsing to where you're considering living and tagging (clicking) the spot in mind this site will give the user the low-down on the local area - local crime levels, schooling options, buses and more. [pick-my-house.com](http://pick-my-house.com/) (external link).

**ASBOrometer** This mobile phone app has become a national phenomenon, measuring levels of anti-social behaviour at your current location in England or Wales and shows key local statistics. It was made possible by the data.gov.uk initiative, which is opening up UK government data for public reuse. After achieving over 80,000 downloads in two days, ASBOrometer became the number 1 free app in the UK iTunes App Store. [www.asborometer.com](http://www.asborometer.com/) (external link).

**Best Care Homes** is a compare the market style search engine that helps the user find the right care home for a family member or client. Its database includes extracts from government inspection reports as well as information supplied by care homes, offering more detail than any other directory of care homes. The site also provides tools to help request more information about a residential care home or notify by email when new inspection reports are published on particular care homes. [www.bestcarehome.co.uk](http://www.bestcarehome.co.uk/) (external link).

**School Guru** helps parents find the best schools in Hertfordshire and enables them to see whether their child is eligible using official admission and outcome data from individual schools and Hertfordshire County Council. [www.schoolguruhertfordshire.co.uk](http://www.schoolguruhertfordshire.co.uk/) (external link).

The potential for many more of this sort of applications is growing as more Government and Local Authority data is being uploaded online every day. Councils have been asked to publish all their spending information over £500 online by January, which could lead to many more innovative web gadgets on all sorts of issues in the future.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2056449,14 areas to pioneer scheme to 'pool and save' billions,"Fourteen areas are to pioneer a public service revolution that will slash financial red tape and duplication so they respond to local need and save taxpayers' millions, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The revolutionary funding strategy known as 'Community Budgets' will let councils, boroughs or neighbourhoods team up with all public services in their patch to combine resources into a single locally coordinated 'pool and save' pot with greater local control of improved services for local people.

Early research showed that a saving of as little as a two percent equates to over £1bn and this approach has the potential to save up to twenty per cent in some areas.

Mr Pickles is clear the scale of public deficit means the country can no longer afford to leave public service investment in uncoordinated Whitehall silos. He believes this 'silo control' has created unequal access to services that are inefficient and unnecessarily expensive.

By removing Central Government mandates over how public money is spent locally and giving local professionals the power to combine budgets and coordinate local services using the best local intelligence, large swathes of red tape can be slashed and millions of pounds can be saved.

Four showcase areas, twice as many as first planned, have been selected today to run a Community Budget next year focusing on 'ways to create local growth and reduce dependency on the state'. Billions could be shifted into single budget pots to test how a local set up could deliver more efficient services.

  * **Cheshire West and Chester** will look at how to pool a single budget of between £3-4bn from over 150 local services;
  * **Greater Manchester** aims to use joined up local investment to reduce levels of dependency and to help create 50,000 jobs in the next four years;
  * **West London** will focus on skills and training for over 16s, speeding up family courts, and curbing youth violence and anti-social behaviour;
  * **Essex** will pull together a single set of objectives for the £10.4 billion they spend on public services so it is used more effectively and efficiently.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We can no longer afford the luxury which left public investment idling to no purpose. We need a gear change that makes 'silo control' obsolete and starts a local service revolution that puts people at the heart of spending decisions and saves money.
> 
> ""We're setting up more Community Budgets than originally intended -these 'pool and save' pioneers can bring about truly local services with one big local cheque that knocks out bureaucratic processes everywhere and upends Whitehall's monopoly over public money that's hemmed in frontline workers for decades.""

The intention to select Community budget pilots was first announced by the Deputy Prime Minister in June as the second part of a major 'resource review' to overhaul council funding and boost local finances. Earlier this week plans were set out, alongside a new Local Government Finance Bill, to let councils keep a share of the business rates they collect rather than returning it to Whitehall.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg said:

> ""The government is overseeing a fundamental shift in the way Whitehall works - putting power firmly in the hands of local people.
> 
> ""Community budgets will give professionals the clout to control how money is spent in their communities.
> 
> ""They will put local authorities in the driving seat to deliver better services, cut red tape and save millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.""

The pilots will create a joint team with local partners, aided by Government officials and the Local Government Association, to establish their devolved budget proposals with decision making structures for a locally run operation during 2012. This will help achieve significant public sector savings, cut red tape and improve policy making.

Ten 'neighbourhood level' areas have also been selected to develop smaller scale Community Budgets that will give residents a micro-local level say over the services they want and use. The local community will play a leading role, working with councils and professionals, to shape local services so they work from a customer's perspective.

A package of support will be agreed with each of the following ten pilot areas:

Cowgate, Kenton Bar and Montague in **Newcastle**; **White City**, **Kingston**, **Poplar**, **Queens Park in London**; Ilfracombe in **North Devon**; **Bradford Trident**; Sherwood in **Tunbridge Wells**; **Haverhill**; and Castle Vale, Shard End and Balsall Heath in **Birmingham**.

Steve Wyler, Chief Executive of Locality, said:

> ""We very much welcome this announcement and support government driving budgets down to neighbourhood level. Persistent problems which afflict communities can be addressed by putting an end to the bureaucratic nonsense of spending silos so that local people, with all their local insights, can be in the driving seat.  We hope that this approach will be rolled out quickly across the whole country.""

### Notes to editor

1. More details on the four 'Whole-Place' Community Budget Pilot plans:

  * **Greater Manchester** aims to use joint investment from a range of partners to reduce levels of dependency and support growth critical to creating 56,000 private sector jobs over the next four years. They will use local evidence to decide how best to address cross cutting priorities like unemployment, low skills and dependency to support early intervention. This will result in a greater efficiency and public spending savings.
  * **Cheshire West and Chester** plan to review over 150 local services that have the potential to pool a single budget of £3-4 billion. They will make neighbourhoods safer and cleaner. Create new opportunities for jobs and learning as part of a 'better deal' for unemployed people. A first class children's centre will be at the heart of the community plus help for older residents to lead independent lives.
  * **West London** - Hammersmith & Fulham, Kensington & Chelsea, and Westminster - have put together a 'Tri-Government Guarantee', setting out their targets these include making sure every young person under 25 has a job or is in training or education; 80 per cert of children across the three boroughs achieve five A*-C grade GCSEs; access to high-quality affordable housing. The pilot will involve radically redesigning services and aligning funding in a number of key areas over the next 12 months.
  * **Essex** will encourage residents to play a greater role in their community and in helping to shape good value public services. Any savings delivered could be reinvested back into prevention and early intervention, not handed back to the Treasury. Local priorities include health and social care, skills for young people, economic growth and community safety.

2. More details on the Neighbourhood level Community Budget Plans:

  * Hammersmith & Fulham (White City) want to integrate neighbourhood service budgets including welfare, crime, social care and 'clean/green'.
  * Tower Hamlets (Poplar Harca) want their neighbourhood services to include support for local enterprise with more spent on services than bureaucracy.
  * Bradford Trident will co-commission parish functions, health and unemployment services with youth and sports centres run by a social enterprise.
  * Tunbridge Wells (Sherwood) aims to devolve all appropriate service funding to the neighbourhood.
  * Kingston (Norbiton) will extend Local Integrated Services to all neighbourhood funds looking at housing, policing and community engagement.
  * Haverhill will devolve a pooled budget to the 'One Haverhill' partnership. This will embed local knowledge and community influence over services.
  * Birmingham (Balshall Heath, Shard End, Castle Vale) want the pilots to become a catalyst for more pooled budgets focused on prevention. Balsall Heath Forum and Shard End will be community led approaches while Castle Vale Community Partnership will be housing association led.
  * Westminster (Queens Park) will create a Recovery and Early Action Partnership to bring all relevant services and residents in the neighbourhood together to focus on families at risk.
  * Ilfracombe (North Devon DC) will create shadow accounts in ""Virtual bank"" as the first step to co-commissioning, before moving to budgetary control. It will look at neighbourhood services, libraries and highways.
  * Newcastle (Cowgate, Kenton Bar, Montague) will broker agreements so ward committees can invest in family-support services delivered by a community enterprise.

3. A Challenge and Learning Network will be set up to share learning from the pilots with other areas. The Network will help drive the Community Budget agenda forward helping make sure they are ambitious, sustainable and capable of being replicated elsewhere. Fourteen councils will sit on the network: Birmingham; Blackburn with Darwen Borough; Cornwall; Durham; Hertfordshire; Lincolnshire; Greenwich; Harrow; Sheffield; Shropshire; Sunderland City; Swindon; Wiltshire; and Worcestershire.

4. A Community Budgets Prospectus was issued on 17 October 2011 inviting councils to submit expressions of interest to pilot Community Budgets across the whole of a local authority area and also at a neighbourhood level. It set out how pilots would be shortlisted, then selected and includes details of the offer made to pilots: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/communitybudgetspropspectus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/communitybudgetspropspectus).

5. Community Budgets were announced as part of the Spending Review 2010 (see [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1748116](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1748111)).

6. Detail of the Local Government Resource Review Terms of Reference (phase two: Community Budgets) are available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1933423.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1933423.pdf) (PDF, 43 kb).

7. Locality is a leading network of over 650 community-led organizations. It helps local people to set up and run local organisations for the benefit of their communities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1748116,16 areas get 'community budgets' to help the vulnerable,"Sixteen areas were today given direct control over local spending in their area free of centrally imposed conditions as part of the Spending Review.

From April next year this first phase of 16 areas covering 28 councils and their partners will be put in charge of 'Community Budgets' that pool various strands of Whitehall funding into a single 'local bank account' for tackling social problems around families with complex needs.

Ministers are determined to give communities more power to target spending on key local priorities, despite the reductions in spending. Communities will be able to hold their councils to account in making sure tighter funding gets spent better.

Around £8 billion a year is spent on around 120,000 families that have multiple problems, with funding only getting to local areas via hundreds of separate schemes and agencies. Despite this investment, these families' problems continue. Services need to join up and intervene earlier so that families are given the chance to turn their lives around. This integrated, early intervention approach will also drive down costs.

Community Budgets, which the Government intends to roll out nationally by 2013-14, will put councils and their partners in the driving seat by pooling funds for tackling these families' needs into one budget so communities can develop local solutions to local problems.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Until now councils have never had the freedom to do things their own way. Whitehall funding has been funneled through hundreds of disparate funding programmes wrapped up in tight financial conditions that effectively strangled local choice. As a result the incentive to be innovative, efficient and responsive to voters instead of Whitehall was dramatically dulled.
> 
> ""By uprooting the silos, unlocking and relinquishing the spending controls administered by Whitehall we can give towns and places the freedom to direct spending to best meets the needs of the citizens within their boundaries.
> 
> ""We have already freed up billions of pounds of council funding but we're determined to do more to put councils in the spending driving seat. As part of the spending review, we've torn down those artificial barriers so that the funding for families with complex needs reaches areas as a single pot of money - a Community Budget - that will help better protect frontline services and help the most vulnerable.""

Already the Government will be freeing up a further £7 billion of council funding from red tape and bureaucracy from 2011-12, but Ministers believe even more can be achieved with Community Budgets. By having one budget wrapping money and services around the needs of the vulnerable, councils and partners will be able to directly support those that need help with education, health, anti-social behaviour and housing - instead of maintaining the service organisations.

Ministers believe Community Budgets will also help drive down overhead costs by removing the bureaucratic financial restrictions that have created barriers, generated waste and duplication in public spending stifling local innovation. They will be able to redesign and integrate frontline services across organisations and share management functions to reduce running costs for the best local outcomes.

The Government believes all 16 areas have demonstrated that they have strong local relationships involving communities, voluntary sector and public sector players which put them in a strong position to operate the first Community Budgets from 2011-12. They are:

  * Birmingham

  * Blackburn with Darwen

  * Blackpool

  * Bradford

  * Essex

  * Greater Manchester (a group of 10 councils)

  * Hull

  * Kent

  * Leicestershire

  * Lincolnshire

  * London Borough of Barnet

  * London Borough of Croydon

  * London Borough of Islington

  * London Borough of Lewisham

  * The London Boroughs of Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Wandsworth

  * Swindon

### Notes to editors

1. This is just the beginning, the Government expects Community Budgets to be available for those places with elected city mayors and from April 2013 we intend to make Community Budgets available to all places.

2. Central Government departments will also be actively working with a further 20 innovative areas to help push forward local flexibility and to address barriers. For example, DCLG and Cabinet Office will be working together to support budgets focussed at the very local level in 13 areas, including Birmingham, Bristol, Newcastle, and Stoke. Cabinet Office will work with Cheshire West and Chester, Kingston-upon-Thames, Blackburn, Barnsley, Calderdale, Sheffield, Leeds, Tameside, Warrington to involve communities in designing and commissioning services that better meet local needs. Places that want to trial different ways of delivering services including community-designed and delivered services are encouraged to do so.

3. In taking this work forward, the Department will be working alongside the national champion, announced in the Spending Review, who will be driving forward a national campaign to support and help turn around the lives of families with multiple problems.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1642160,40 ideas a day to cut red tape,"In just five working days, the Communities Secretary's call for suggestions about cutting red tape has attracted more than 200 ideas.

![Image: Eric Pickles and Andrew Stunell meet front line workers in Boscombe](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/163394.jpg)A number of ideas have caught Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles' eye and he has written back to some of those individuals to thank them for taking the time to send them in. They include:

  * a Bournemouth resident, who told the Secretary of State, on his visit to Boscombe that there were hundreds of people who wanted to volunteer to help with the upkeep of parks but all the 'health and safety' forms and supervisory rules prevent communities from getting involved
  * in Fylde Coast, a resident wrote that the law that forces councils to advertise when they transfer public space ownership between county and parish councils wastes taxpayers' money
  * one of the ideas from Shropshire was that all of the rules for preparing local development plans should be consolidated into a single set of regulations
  * in Northampton, a resident suggested getting rid of central government targets because they are time consuming and about box ticking not improving services

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Too much power has been sucked out of communities into Whitehall eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy.
> 
> ""It is great to see frontline council workers making localism a reality by helping us cut back red tape, wresting control away from the bureaucrats and reversing the years of creeping state control.
> 
> ""In a week we've already had over 200 ideas from people who know what is getting in the way of them doing their frontline job. Keep them coming.""

### Have your say

On 7 July 2010 the Communities Secretary called on council staff and sector experts to submit their ideas. The Communities Secretary is keen to hear more ideas. If you have thought of something that will make work easier but have not told anyone yet or know of some CLG sponsored secondary legislation, statutory guidance or regulation that should be scrapped - then have your say by emailing: [cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

While we cannot guarantee that we will implement all suggestions they will all be considered.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1842073,50 days to go to sign up to be a councillor,"With only 50 days left to put yourself forward as a councillor in this year's local elections Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has been joined by councillors past and present to urge more people to consider standing.

Mr Shapps said:

> ""With more powers being devolved from Whitehall to the Town Hall, now is a better time than ever before to stand for election. Through the Localism Bill, a key part of the Big Society, we are freeing councils to make decisions that will benefit their whole community, and come up with creative ways to improve their local area.""

The Localism Bill, currently before Parliament, will devolve unprecedented power to local communities. Its measures include a new General Power of Competence for councils and their councillors giving them the green light to be creative and act in the best interests of their communities. Rules that have restricted councillors from championing local issues will be scrapped and councils will be allowed to return to the Committee system meaning all councillors will have direct involvement in decision making.

Mr Shapps said that despite having been tied down by Whitehall red tape and local bureaucracy he is full of admiration for those existing councillors who have continued to champion their communities. But with these restrictions set to become a thing of the past he wants to see a new generation join this army of community champions. The Minister also hopes that this will see councillors become more representative of the communities they serve. According to the most recent survey only around 30 per cent of councillors are women, 3.4 per cent from ethnic minority backgrounds and the average age of councillors is almost 59.

Manjula Sood, a councillor in Leicester, said:

> ""Being a councillor is so rewarding. It allows one to make a real difference to the lives of others. It helps one to champion injustice and eradicate inefficiencies. Councillors are involved in all aspects of public service as well as community issues.""

Manjula implores anyone who has a passion to make a difference ""to become a councillor and leave a lasting legacy to the lives of others"".

Afzal Khan served Manchester, his ward and city, for 10 years. In his words ""this role has been both challenging and rewarding."" He also urges everybody with the time, energy and desire to help to improve their local area to get involved in politics, saying that ""you can make a difference but you have to be part of something to bring change"".

Fiona Thompson, a councillor from Welwyn Hatfield said:

> ""I always thought becoming a councillor was the sort of thing other people did. But the work is extremely rewarding and I really feel I'm making a difference in the community. I would encourage anyone in my position who cares about where they live to stand to be a councillor as it is vital to keep our communities alive. I welcome the changes that will be introduced when the Localism Bill is passed.""

People interested in putting themselves forward should consider whether a local political party best represents their views and speak to them about how to stand. Councils will also provide advice, and further details and contacts can be found at the Government supported website [www.beacouncillor.org.uk](http://www.beacouncillor.org.uk) (External link). Councils have varying dates from which people can apply to be a councillor but all applications must be received by 4 April 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1735522,"9,000 parish councils to be freed from archaic payment rules","9,000 Parish Councils will be freed from old fashioned rules which force them to use out-dated payment methods such as cheques, so that they can make faster and easier payments, helping the small businesses they employ.

This comes as part of the Coalition Government's drive to cut unnecessary red tape, improve efficiency and give power back to local people and councils, and has also been raised as an issue by people responding to the Government's Spending Challenge.

Under the changes announced by Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today, Parish Councils, who represent around 19 million people across the country, will be given the freedom to abolish outdated methods of payment and adopt modern banking methods such as electronic transfers.

Parish councils spend over £340m each year, but they are bound by 1894 laws which have restricted them to using outdated ways of spending their money. This old fashioned legislation means that even the smallest of payments made by Parish Councils must be signed by two members of the council, stopping them from making quick electronic payments and leading to a time-consuming process.

The new changes which are planned to come into force in 2011 will mean that Parish Councils will be given the freedom to make use of modern banking methods such as electronic banking, which will save them valuable time and enable them to carry out their business in a quicker and easier way. But it is also an important move as cheques are set to be abolished completely in just eight years time.

The changes are also set to benefit many private companies who parish councils employ to carry out work and they should now get paid faster, something which is crucial for the survival of small businesses.

However, important safeguards will also be put in place to make sure that all the payments made by Parish Councils are legitimate and that there is no misuse of the system. These checks and controls will be designed by the National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Parish Councils have been around for over a hundred years, but it doesn't mean they should be bound by outdated rules which make it harder for them to serve their local community.
> 
> ""It's time to bring Parish Councils into the 21st Century so they can get on and do their jobs in a faster and simpler way.
> 
> ""This is about removing the barriers so that local people can deliver the services that their communities care about, but it could also help hard pressed contractors who rely on quick payments to survive.""

According to the Payments Council which monitors the way payments are made, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of cheques being used with cheque usage dropping by £21.5bn over the last year alone. This is because businesses and consumers have moved to faster and more convenient electronic and card payments.

The move has also been supported by the National Association of Local Councils, whose Chairman Councillor Michael Chater said:

> ""I am delighted that the Government is making it easier for local councils to get on and do their job through modernising the rules on the way they can make payments.
> 
> ""This much needed reform is very welcome and underlines the important role local councils play in their communities supporting local people and local businesses.
> 
> ""This initiative will give a much welcome boost to local councils to help them operate more efficiently and effectively and enable them to continue to play their role at the heart of localism and Big Society.""

### Notes to editors

1. The changes are expected to come into place in 2011 subsequent to consultation and the legislative process.

2. The Payments Council produce statistics on the method of payments and the latest quarter data can be found at: [www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/files/payments_council/q2_2010_statistical_report_(final)_-_9_sept_2010.pdf](http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/files/payments_council/q2_2010_statistical_report_%28final%29_-_9_sept_2010.pdf) (external link).

3. The National Association of Local Councils (NALC) is the nationally recognised membership body representing the interests of around 9,000 local councils and their 80,000 local councillors in England. Local councils serve electorates ranging from small rural communities to major cities, all are independently elected and raise a precept from the local community. Together, they can be identified as among the nation's most influential grouping of grassroots opinion-formers. Over 19 million people live in communities served by local councils, around 35 per cent of the population, whilst over 200 new local councils have been created in the last 10 years.

4. Local councils work towards improving community well-being and providing better services at a local level. Their work falls into three main categories:

  * representing the local community;
  * delivering services to meet local needs;
  * striving to improve quality of life and community wellbeing.

Through a range of powers local councils provide and maintain a variety of important and visible local services including allotments, bridleways, burial grounds, bus shelters, car parks, commons, community transport schemes, crime reduction measures, footpaths, leisure facilities, local youth projects, open spaces, public lavatories, planning, street cleaning, street lighting, tourism activities, traffic calming measures, village greens and litter bins.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1796009,A fair deal for local taxpayers: freezing Council Tax and protecting the vulnerable,"Despite the huge pressures on public finances, the Coalition Government has taken unprecedented steps to protect councils most reliant on central government funding and freeze council tax, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

Today the provisional details of the funding settlement for councils in England for 2011-12 and 2012-13 were published. Reductions to council spending reflect the urgent need for the public sector to help put the country's finances back in order, keep interest rates down and prevent national debt escalating to £1.4 trillion of taxpayers' money.

Ministers have taken a progressive and fair approach to calculating how the £29 billion of central taxpayer funding for local government grants this year will be allocated. More money is being channelled at those areas of the country that have the highest levels of need. A plain English guide to today's Finance Settlement is also being published to cut through Whitehall jargon, this is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf).

Ministers are clear that the settlement represents a fair deal that will enable councils to protect the front-line services people rely on, shield the most vulnerable places, safeguard the most vulnerable people, and protect taxpayers' interests. The Government has:

  * Given more weight to those parts of the country with the highest levels of need. For example, funding per head for residents in Hackney in 2011-12 will be £1043 compared with £125 per head in Wokingham.
  * Ensured that the settlement is fair between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. Formula grant is being directed to where it is needed most.
  * Sought to insulate those areas of the country most dependant on central government funding by creating four separate grant bands to group councils into, based on the extent to which different councils are reliant on government funding. These bands or 'floors' set different limits for their reductions and thereby protect councils against the sharper grant reductions they would otherwise have faced.
  * Established a transitional grant of £85 million for 2011-12 and £14 million in 2012-13. This transitional funding will help councils manage issues related to the ending of the Working Neighbourhoods Fund. This was a three year fund that was always scheduled to end in March 2011.

Ministers have also sought to deliver a fair deal to local taxpayers and all councils by:

  * Taking a fairer and more progressive approach to calculating grant than that used in the past by focusing on the impact any grant reductions would have on the all important spending power of individual councils. Local authority budgets are not just made up of formula grant - they also include other government grants plus council tax receipts. A focus on spending power therefore considers the financial position of councils in the round - this includes funding from the Department for Health totalling £648 million in 2011-12 and £622 million in 2012-13 of NHS funding to support social care and benefit health, improving integrated working.
  * Limiting the average spending power reduction across all councils to 4.4 per cent in 2011-12 and ensuring that no council faces a reduction of more than 8.9 per cent in spending power in 2011-12 or 2012-13; the provisional settlement today distributes the £29 billion in 2011-12 and the £27 billion in 2012-13 that the October Spending Review allocated to local authorities through formula grant.
  * Protecting the public from council tax rises by making £650 million available to fund a one year freeze on council tax, offering real help to families and pensioners. The funding will continue over the Spending Review period to prevent council tax from shooting up next year. Local taxpayers living in an average Band D home could save up to £70 a year over the next four years.
  * Rolling £2.4 billion funding into the formula grant to support adult social care services - one of the biggest pressures councils face - ensuring that the lion's share of resources go to councils delivering social services and that the needs of the most vulnerable people are met.
  * Making additional resources available through the Early Intervention Grant to support early years' services, the Regional Growth Fund to support areas to deliver economic growth and the New Homes Bonus to establish a financial incentive for councils to deliver housing.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""This is all about how we raise and spend taxpayers' money. Government has been living a credit card lifestyle at taxpayers' expense, and now it's time to pay off some of those bills.
> 
> ""There has been a great deal of speculation and scaremongering about what the implications of the local government settlement might be. The reality is that despite the toughest economic circumstances in recent memory, the Coalition Government will ensure that next year the average reduction in councils' spending power will be 4.4 per cent.
> 
> ""By adopting an intelligent and fair approach to the way funding is allocated we have been able to ensure those parts of the country that are most reliant on central funding continue to get the lion's share of the taxpayers' money that is available. Funding fairness underpins this settlement.
> 
> ""We are protecting the public from excessive council tax rises by stopping any council tax revaluation and setting up a £650 million fund so town halls can freeze council tax this April. This will offer real help to families and pensioners.
> 
> ""Taxpayers are no longer prepared to write a blank cheque for the public sector. But they do want less interference in their local communities from Whitehall government. So the Coalition Government is delivering the most significant shift in power from officials in London to elected local councils in a generation.
> 
> ""Whilst resources are tight in the current financial climate, council freedoms are not. Councils now have unprecedented freedoms over how to prioritise their money. The need to reduce public spending means that this is a unique settlement, but also a unique opportunity for councils to show how efficient they can be, root out the wasteful spending that still exists and ensure that money goes to the frontline public services.""

The settlement is set against the background of the most radical shift in power to local government for a generation. Local authorities have already been given full control over £7 billion of funding, all non-schools ring fenced grants have been removed, councils and the NHS are being brought closer together and the bureaucratic burdens associated with inspection and targets have been removed.

This package of measures gives councils a radical new set of tools to manage reductions in line with the priorities and needs of their residents. They can protect frontline services providing they use the significant new freedoms and flexibilities they have been given to put everything they do under the spotlight, share services and increase transparency. A total of £2.4 billion of adult social care funding will also have been moved in to Formula Grant by 2014-15 - this is £1 billion more than for social care grants this year.

### Notes to editors

1. The Department for Communities and Local Government has today published a Plain English Guide to the funding settlement to assist people who understandably may not know their Relative Needs Formulas from their Area Cost Adjustments, or their Damping Floors from their Formula Grants. _A Plain English Guide to the Local Government Finance Settlement for 2011-12_ is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf).

2. Local Government accounts for around 25 per cent of all public expenditure. Councils were always going to have to play their part in fixing the black hole in the nation's finances.

3. Around a quarter of all council revenue is raised through council tax. The amount raised by individual councils through council tax varies dependant on the nature of the area. Revenue from council tax, along with other income a council receives, determines the overall level of a councils spending power. The more dependent a council is on formula grant funding from central government to fund their budgets the lower their spending power.

4. If in calculating the settlement Ministers had applied a blanket reduction in formula grant to all authorities it would not have accounted for the fact that some councils are more self sufficient and thus have more money available to spend and would have left a number of councils significantly worse off than others.

5. In order to fund the transitional grant and ensure that councils are protected from unmanageable reductions in their budgets in the first year, DCLG has taken difficult decisions on its own budget. Despite a reduction in DCLG revenue funding of 46 per cent in cash terms (equivalent to 51 per cent in real terms) over the spending review and 12 per cent in cash terms in 2011-12 the department has provided £85 million additional money next year for local government over and above the formula grant settlement. This has the effect of reducing the spending available for the department's own programmes by a further 4 per cent.

6. Detail of the spending power reduction for individual councils can be found here [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/1796201.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/1796201.xls).

7. The details of the spending power analysis and details of how the transitional grant limits reductions to 8.9 per cent in both years is set out in a consultation on the transitional grant available on the local government finance website. The analysis of spending power includes funding £648 million in 2011-12, and £622 million in 2012-13, through the NHS budget, to support social services and benefit health - promoting integrated working between Primary Care Trusts and local authorities.

8. The settlement is fair between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. We are getting formula grant to where it is needed most

In calculating the settlement ministers have ensured that formula grant funding per head is higher in those parts of the country with the highest level of need. For example, needy councils receiving high per head funding in 2011-12 are: Hackney, £1043; Tower Hamlets, £968; Liverpool, £764; Manchester, £714; Leicester, £602. Whereas less needy authorities receive much lower per head funding in 2011-12 are: Stockport, £305; Solihull, £263; Bromley, £214; Richmond upon Thames £158; Wokingham, £125.

9. This announcement marks the start of a further short period of statutory consultation which runs to 17 January. Ministers will then finalise their proposals and the settlement for 2011-12 will be debated in Parliament in early February in time for councils to set their budgets for next year.

10. The Coalition Government is giving more freedoms and flexibilities to councils, from reducing ring-fencing to bringing in a general power of competence in the Localism Bill. By cutting the red tape and Whitehall interference which holds councils back, this will give them the ability to protect frontline services and focus their spending on local priorities. This includes ending the expensive Comprehensive Area Assessments and Local Area Agreements. Independent research put the average annual cost of reporting back to government at £1.8 million. Leicestershire councils found they had 90 full time staff collecting and processing more than 3,000 individual data items for central government at a cost of £3.7 million a year. They also faced 83 different inspections every year.

11. The Localism Bill overturns decades of central government control and gives power back to local communities. We aren't just devolving power to local councils - we are also giving more power to citizens, community groups and neighbourhoods, to help local people shape and influence the places in which they live and help build the Big Society.

12. Councils can protect frontline services by sharing services and back office functions, improve procurement to get more for less, bring escalating senior pay under control, and use transparency to cut waste and empower the public to see how their money could be better spent.

13. The Home Office has today published allocations of grant to police authorities in England and Wales for 2011-12 and given an indication of how it intends to allocate funding for the years 2012-13 to 2014-15.

The Department for Transport has also published today the local transport capital settlement for individual local authorities in England. This gives details of the allocation of more than £3 billion over the next 4 years for local highways maintenance and over £1.3 billion for small transport schemes. The announcement gives the individual amounts that each authority will receive over the next two years, and indicative amounts for the two years after that. Funding allocations are calculated according to needs-based formulae that are developed with local authorities. The funding is not ring-fenced, and local authorities are free to spend their allocations in accordance with their priorities. This announcement follows a recent consultation on local transport capital funding. A summary of responses and the Department's proposed next steps are available on the Department's website at: [www.dft.gov.uk/localtransportfunding](http://www.dft.gov.uk/localtransportfunding) (external link).

The Department for Education is announcing local authority allocations for their Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) and capital for 2011-12 and for the Early Intervention Grant in 2011-12 and 2012-13 and total funding for the pupil premium.

",13-Dec-10,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,,,,eric-pickles,,,,
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1977816,A fair deal for the voluntary and community sector: from Whitehall to town halls,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today published guidance to local authorities on how to protect voluntary and community groups from disproportionate cuts to their funding.

It follows warnings from Mr Pickles that councils should not ""pull up the drawbridge"" in this tough economic climate, but should instead look to give greater support for local groups that do so much for some of the most vulnerable in their communities.

Mr Pickles has also sought to cut reams of red tape on local councils to make it easier and more efficient for them to meet the needs of their residents. The Communities Secretary has scrapped 56 pages of prescriptive statutory guidance on local priorities introduced by the previous Government.

Instead, councils will have only one page of guidance on how best to achieve Best Value in their areas - not just in terms of cost for local taxpayers, but also the wider social and environmental benefits above and beyond the services they provide.

And in deciding how best to fulfil their Best Value Duty, councils are required to consult those using, or likely to use, a local service. This should include community and voluntary organisations.

This new deal sets out that councils should not pass on larger reductions to their local voluntary and community sectors and small businesses than they take on themselves. In particular:

  * those councils looking to reduce or end funding, or any other support to one of these organisations should give at least three months' notice of the actual reduction to both the organisation involved and the users of the service they provide
  * councils should involve and discuss their plans with the organisation and local service users as early as possible before making any final decisions on the future of the service; and
  * councils should give organisations, local service users and the wider community the opportunity to offer options for reshaping and reducing the costs of the services provided.

Central Government departments have already signed up to these same principles.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Community and voluntary groups provide vital and valuable services to our communities, often aimed at some of the most vulnerable in our society. They deserve a fair deal.
> 
> ""That's why I'm introducing new guidance on councils to consider how they fulfil the Best Value Duty for their communities, not just in stark money terms but also in terms of the wider benefits to residents above and beyond the services that these organisations provide. And in return, I'm cutting reams of red tape that in the past have hampered council efforts to get their important work done.
> 
> ""I'm not asking councils to do anything that I wouldn't do myself, so all Central Government departments are now signed up to these fair new standards.""

In the new streamlined statutory guidance Mr Pickles has also clarified that there is no requirement for councils to undertake lifestyle or diversity questionnaires of their residents or their suppliers. Ministers want to see an end to the costly and unnecessary surveys and questionnaires being sent out by some councils alongside responses to residents' queries about rubbish collection or joining the local library. These surveys often ask personal questions about religious beliefs, sexual orientation and ethnicity, often duplicating information already collected in the Census.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""At a time when taxpayers are watching their pennies, the last thing councils should be doing is sending out unnecessary and intrusive questionnaires.
>

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/2086370,Heads of Agreement for firefighters' pension scheme reached,"The Government has today published a Heads of Agreement for the Firefighters' Pension Scheme in England. This follows constructive engagement with representatives of all four firefighter unions.

The Government pays tribute to the importance of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the bravery, dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work in it. The Government is committed to providing public service pensions that are sustainable, fair and effective.

Building on the proposals brought forward by Lord Hutton, these proposals aim to strike a balanced deal between public service workers and the taxpayer. They will ensure that public service workers continue to have access to good pensions, while taxpayers benefit from greater control over their costs.

The Heads of Agreement presents a fair and affordable long-term reform package that means firefighters will look to their future retirement with certainty and with a pension to reflect their valuable years of service.

Public sector pensions will remain among the very best available - a guaranteed level and inflation proofed. Only 1 in 10 private sector workers have access to such schemes.'

This Heads of Agreement sets out the main elements of a scheme design that will form the basis for ongoing discussions about reforms to be introduced from 2015. Trades unions have agreed to take this package to their Executives and, if appropriate, their membership for further consideration.

Further discussions on the remaining detail will take place over the coming weeks.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1848275,A new independent report shows value of handypersons,"Returning home from hospital after a fall, or facing the mountain of climbing a step when you are elderly can be daunting, but help through handypersons services can go a long way to reducing these worries.

A new independent report commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government shows that handypersons services around the country are showing that they are value for money and help elderly people to carry on living in their own homes with confidence.

Just one example is expressed in the words of one elderly Tranmere resident:

> ""I would like to thank you and the department for the service of your 'handyman'. The relief to be able to pull myself up the step to my door is beyond words. I am having so much pleasure from it that I felt the least I could do was return thanks.""

The report says handypersons services, can reduce the risk of injury or even death through preventing further falls, reducing risk of burglary or fire. These preventative services are cost effective, for example postponing entry into residential care can save up to £28,000 per year per person.

The handypersons services include:

  * odd jobs and small repairs such us putting up shelves or grab rails

  * falls and accident prevention checks and remedial action, for example installing hand rails at steps

  * moving beds and furniture

  * fire safety work such as the installation of smoke alarms, and electric blanket checks

  * home security improvements

  * gardening services

Many local authorities now have handyperson services kick-start funded from DCLG. Handypersons services generally support older people and people with disabilities. These services are often part of the arrangements made to enable people to be discharged from hospital to return to a safe home environment. Services are provided through in-house staff, housing associations, or independent providers including charities and individual traders.

DCLG has funded handyperson services from 2009 through direct grants to kick start services where they did not exist and build the capacity of others. From April 2011, handypersons funding will be rolled into unringfenced Formula Grant as part of the Government's decentralisation programme but local authorities were informed that the national allocation is £15.5m for 2011-12 and £13.5m for 2012-13.

Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council has been running its handyperson service since 2005 and works in partnership with the local Home Improvement Agency (HIA). Through joining up the handyperson service with occupational therapy, adult social care, the Home Improvement Agency and social landlords, they have succeeded in reducing the waiting list for major home adaptations by 12 months.

Now widowed, a Bromborough lady, was keen to thank Wirral's staff saying:

> ""I recently had a keycase fitted and thus I am now, no longer beholden to anyone else to hold keys on my behalf. This is very comforting.
> 
> ""From my first contact with a man who provided me with the correct number to the lady at the handyperson service who arranged it my personal thanks. George, who fitted it, was efficient and friendly and also notified the code number etc. to the right people, which was a big help. I wish to put on record my appreciation. Any organisation is only as good as its staff.""

Feedback from clients shows that their gardening service is also appreciated. A garden becoming increasingly overgrown can be a great worry and it also advertises that a vulnerable, often older, person lives there.

> ""On behalf of me and my husband, I would like to thank you for the excellent service provided by the handyperson. The handyperson is such a very special person, does such a good job in a friendly cheerful manner, nothing is too much trouble. Please give him my thanks"" says Mrs M of Bebington.

Wirral's gardening service has also helped a young person with Asperger's syndrome giving him work experience that greatly helped his confidence.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1728546,Account books opened as Pickles continues to show public the money,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles continues to trailblaze transparency today by publishing more departmental spending and setting out new austerity action.

In the first of regular updates Communities and Local Government has published spend over £500 online for the first quarter of 2010-11 (April-June).

With every central government department required to publish data above £25,000 from November Mr Pickles is moving ahead of the game to shine a spotlight on spend. Having set the bar at £500 for town halls, Mr Pickles also believes his own department should play by those same rules.

### New cost-saving ideas for thriftier future

The Secretary of State also set out series of cost-saving measures being implemented at the Department from cutting printers, to turning the heating down to closing the Department's HQ. The ideas submitted by staff are part of identified £780m savings across the CLG budget for 2010-11.

The money saving ideas, submitted by staff, include:

  * New compliance rules to ensure staff always use public transport and standard class on trains;
  * An end to refreshments for internal staff meetings and any meeting under four hours;
  * Cancellation of non-essential newspaper and magazine subscriptions;
  * A reduction in staff Blackberries and mobile phones;
  * Cutting down on first-class post;
  * Switching off a number of lifts during quiet periods;
  * Plans to limit the number of printers and limiting photocopiers to one per floor;
  * Plans to close CLG's HQ overnight and at weekends; and
  * Trial turning heating down to save energy and expense.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Being open about how taxpayers' money is spent will push central and local government into rooting out waste and duplication. That's why we're throwing open the shutters and bringing the full glare of the public's eye onto spending.
> 
> ""This new transparent era means a new way of thinking for councils but I'm showing them it's possible by publishing more of my department's spending online. I can't expect councils to cut waste if we don't get our own house in order. Today I'm implementing the best austerity ideas from CLG staff from cutting catering, to only using second-class stamps to more double-sided printing. These show there are thriftier and smarter ways to use taxpayers' money in the future.
> 
> ""The whole country has to play its part as we tackle a mountain of inherited debt. By publishing this data we invite an army of armchair auditors to scrutinise where their money goes and make sure it is spent on the right priorities. I want town halls to do the same so the public have local spending at their fingertips.""

Departmental spending has also been published today for 2008/09 for over £500 and for spending over £1000 for Arms Length Bodies (ALBs). Last month spending details over £500 for 2009/10 were published.

### Books opened to reveal more Whitehall local spending data

In addition central government departments and ALBs are expanding the data made available relating to expenditure in local areas through a free to use website. The public can now find datasets on local spending by searching for local-spend-data on government's central data portal [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/home) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2050225,Accountability and transparency for fire and rescue authorities,"A consultation on a new Fire and Rescue National Framework was launched today (13 December 2011) by the Fire and Rescue Minister Bob Neill. The consultation seeks views on freeing fire and rescue authorities to tailor their services to meet local needs whilst meeting the wider needs of national resilience.

This more localist approach builds on the approach of the Coalition Government in ending the regionalisation of the fire service and dismantling regional government in England. We have already announced that fire and rescue authorities no longer have to work through Regional Management Boards, and we have stopped the forced regionalisation of fire control rooms through the termination of FireControl.

Launching the National Framework consultation Bob Neill said:

> ""The draft National Framework marks a key milestone to reset the relationship between fire and rescue authorities and central Government.
> 
> ""We know that fire and rescue authorities, not Whitehall, are best placed to decide what their communities need. Government must get out of their way and allow them to get on with their vital job of keeping our communities safe.""

The Government is committed to all public services meeting the needs of their communities and the priorities in the draft National Framework are for fire and rescue authorities to:

  * Identify and assess the full range of fire and rescue related risks their area faces, make provision for prevention and protection activities and to respond to incidents appropriately

  * Work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service and

  * Be accountable to communities for the service they provide.

2. The draft National Framework sets out the priorities and objectives for fire and rescue authorities in England in connection with the discharge of their functions. It clarifies the role of fire and rescue authorities and the Government in delivering national resilience and of the importance of accountability and scrutiny for this important public safety service.

3. The consultation will close on 19 March 2012.  Responses can be sent to: [FireNationalFramework@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:FireNationalFramework@communities.gsi.gov.uk) (with any attachments in Microsoft Word). 

4. Alongside this public consultation, the Department will be working with key partner organisations, including the Local Government Association and the Chief Fire Officers' Association, to determine the appropriate strategic governance arrangements for national resilience, as introduced in the draft Framework.

5. The existing National Framework remains in force until the new one is brought into effect.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1885484,Action to boost support for voluntary sector and cut red tape for councils,"Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles, today announced a new fair deal for voluntary and community groups, wrapped up with cutting reams of red tape on local councils.

Mr Pickles is proposing a 'social responsibility' deal which will ask that councils give greater support for local community groups, including:

  * seeking to avoid disproportionate reductions in funding

  * giving at least three months' notice if they plan to reduce or end funding or other support

  * working with the organisation to shape the future of the service; and

  * speaking to the organisation and community about other ideas about how the service could be continued in a different, or more efficient, way

Central government departments will be signing up to the same principles.

This follows a call in a tough talking speech to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations in March when Mr Pickles challenged town halls to resist any temptation to 'pull up the drawbridge' and pass on disproportionate reductions in funding to the voluntary and community sector.

In order to reduce bureaucracy for councils Mr Pickles is scrapping 56 pages of statutory guidance on local priorities issued under the previous Government. The guidance spells out how councils should engage with the people in their area, how they should feed back information, and even a definition of what a 'local person' is. The change will remove barriers and burdens which Ministers believe currently forces councils to focus more on working to top down priorities than on serving their local communities.

Many councils are already working well with the voluntary and community sector. For example, Reading council is increasing the money it gives to voluntary groups, Worcestershire is publishing online all details about grant awards and payments to the voluntary and community sector to increase transparency, and Hampshire using 'microlots' to make it easier for small groups to bid for opportunities. The new 'Fair Deal for the Voluntary and Community Sector' will help ensure that all councils will give voluntary and community groups the opportunity to work together to provide services in new ways.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""The Government is reducing the burden of bureaucracy and removing red tape from councils, local firms and the voluntary sector.
> 
> ""I'm offering a social responsibility deal for town halls: I'm tearing up the unreasonable Whitehall red tape that costs them money and wastes their time. In return, local councils should treat local community groups with the full respect they deserve.
> 
> ""I'm not asking councils to do anything that I wouldn't do myself, so all central government departments are also signing up to these fair new standards.""

Sir Stuart Etherington, Chief Executive of National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said:

> ""This guidance is a welcome step forward, as it makes clear that councils need to avoid making disproportionate cuts to the sector and sets out what voluntary and community organisations should expect from working with local government. In the current climate, it is more important than ever that local authorities and voluntary and community organisations work together effectively, to ensure the best possible outcomes for individuals and communities.""

Sir Stephen Bubb, Chief Executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, said:

> ""It is essential to ensure the right actions are taken by some recalcitrant councils before irreversible damage is done to the voluntary sector in their area.
> 
> ""However we now need to move towards more positive engagement between councils and the sector, both at a local and a national level. We need a relationship where councils work in genuine partnership with the sector in order to reshape public services so that they deliver the best results for service users.""

Greg Clark, Decentralisation Minister, said:

> ""We are returning powers from central government to local authorities, but we expect councils in return to devolve downwards to voluntary and community groups.
> 
> ""We are determined not to decentralise in Government only to see local authorities centralise services in the town hall.""

### Notes to editors

1. The new best value guidance can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/bestvalueconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/bestvalueconsult).

2. The current guidance being withdrawn is _Creating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communities_. This contains 56 pages of guidance on a range of duties and associated issues around how local authorities should agree their priorities, engage their citizens, lead their communities and commission public services. Ministers also plan withdrawing two associated statutory duties. It follows withdrawal last month of other detailed guidance (21 pages) on workforce matters in local authority service contracts, such as terms and conditions of employment - this includes the 'two tier code'. Taken together, this will result in nearly 80 pages of central government guidance being withdrawn. The Local Government Association has called for the revocation of such guidance ([www.lga.gov.uk/lga/publications/publication-display.do?id=14334815](http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/publications/publication-display.do?id=14334815) - external link).

3. The new guidance, taken together with measures such as Community Right to Challenge in the Localism Bill, reduce the barriers that often prevent voluntary organisations competing for local authority contracts. Both measures aim to promote local authority leadership in providing a level playing field for all, including local voluntary and community groups and social enterprises.

4. A number of local authorities are already working with the voluntary and community sector to deliver cost-effective, innovative public services. These include:

  * Gloucestershire will transfer more than 30 buildings or assets worth millions of pounds to communities across Gloucestershire in bid to make services more local. The Big Community Offer will include attractive peppercorn rents and up to 50 per cent asset share. The council will be offering one-off small grants from a pot of £50,000, which will be available to small groups to help kick-start their local projects. (Source: Gloucestershire County Council)

  * Hampshire is pursuing use of 'microlots' to make it easier for small and medium enterprises and the voluntary and community sector to bid for opportunities. For example, the Hampshire and Isle of White Small Project Framework small and medium enterprise builders was set up in 2007 in the Hampshire area for construction project with values between £25,000 and £500,000 and was made up of 15 small and medium enterprise builders. These frameworks have carried out over 220 projects in Hampshire with a total value of £25m, cashable savings £1.7m, helping them achieve average savings of 11 per cent. (Source: Hampshire Council)

  * Reading has set aside £100,000 to fund capital projects for the voluntary and community sector. All groups in Reading will be able to bid for a share of the money to help pay for their key projects. This new money is in addition to the £220,000 the council has confirmed this year to bring the Central Club back into community use, working in close collaboration with the Reading African and Caribbean Community Group. (Source: Reading Council)

  * Walsall is maintaining funding to the voluntary and community sector for this financial year, amounting to £6m annually. The council are exploring with local and national third sector organisations how they can develop a greater role in the delivery of vital services. (Source: Walsall Council).

  * Worcestershire is publishing all details about grant awards and payments under contract to the voluntary and community sector to increase transparency. Close involvement of communities is a key priority in planning for change. A pilot Community Model project is now underway which explores maximum potential for collocation of both statutory and voluntary sector services. (Source: Worcestershire Council)

7. Once published, the new Best Value Guidance will apply to all best value authorities, which are councils plus a range of other authorities including Police, Fire, Broads, Waste and Transport authorities. The full list is:

  * Local authorities (including county, district and Greater London Authority)
  * National Park authorities
  * Broads Authority
  * Police authorities
  * Fire authorities
  * Integrated Transport Authorities
  * London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority
  * Waste disposal authorities
  * Joint Waste Authorities
  * Transport for London
  * London Development Agency
  * economic prosperity boards
  * combined authorities

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1609411,Age of aspiration,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today heralded the return of an ""age of aspiration"" for those struggling to get their first foothold on the property ladder.

![Grant Shapps addressing the RICS conference](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1610131.jpg)Grant Shapps addressing the RICS conference.

In his first speech since becoming Housing Minister, Mr Shapps insisted that the new Coalition Government would be ""prepared to take the tough decisions needed"" to tackle the Budget deficit and prevent rapid increases in interest rates - which would hurt both homeowners and those aspiring to enter the housing market.

At an event hosted by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the Minister highlighted the ""quick and decisive action"" already taken to help improve confidence in the market - including making Home Information Packs history.

And he outlined plans to scrap Regional Spatial Strategies and housing targets, and instead replace them with new incentives, so communities can see the benefits that new developments can bring to their area.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""If we are really serious about supporting people's aspirations for home ownership, the real prize is we must build more homes.  For the first time incentives will create direct benefits for local communities, bringing jobs, investment and more homes for local people.
> 
> ""Rather than being told what to build and where, residents of villages, towns and cities will be able to develop their own vision for their place. We'll introduce Local Housing Trusts, enabling communities to create new housing for local people.
> 
> ""By unleashing the aspirations of communities as well as individuals to build homes where and when they are needed, we will bring about greater certainty - certainty that will replace the conflict caused by imposing housing numbers from right here in Whitehall. Certainty that will give investors confidence to invest.""

He added:

> ""I believe that it is human nature to aspire to shelter and security - and for the many that means owning the roof over your own head. 
> 
> ""And I don't consider it my job as Housing Minister to hold those aspirations back.
> 
> ""With a new Government and despite the enormous financial difficulties the country faces, I want to state clearly today:
> 
> ""The Age of Aspiration is back.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1830232,All councils should be transparent from today,"All councils should have opened their books up to public scrutiny by the end of today.

Almost seven months ago Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles called on every council in the country to publish all of their spending data over £500 online in accessible formats by 31 January 2011.

The latest figures reported to the Department show that 294, over 80 per cent of councils across the country, had got their details up in time.

More councils are expected to go online today and a final analysis will be published in due course. Ministers are also expected to set out the next steps in transparency should any council deprive its residents from having access to this information.

A draft code of practice will be published shortly to help councils get on track.

Councils are expected to put details of senior pay, councillor expenses, tenders and contracts, meetings, and frontline service data into the open so that 'armchair auditors' can clearly see the decisions being made on their behalf by the council in due course. 

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""A new era of transparency unfolds today where every aspect of council business is open to public scrutiny and an army of armchair auditors can shine a spotlight on waste and unnecessary cost to help protect frontline services. 
> 
> ""Transparency and openness must underpin every decision a council makes for its residents. The vast majority have shown they agree and their communities will now see the benefits.
> 
> ""Those who choose to leave their local electorate in the dark will face serious questions from them about why. The public have a right to know where their tax pounds are spent.""

The Department for Communities and Local Government has already set the precedent for councils to follow, regularly publishing all spend data over £500.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2087942,Almost half of all councils already pledging to freeze or cut Council Tax,"Residents and hard pressed families will be delighted to hear that now over 200 councils have already signalled they intend to help with the cost of living by taking up our council tax freeze offer, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles confirmed today.

Over 200 councils in England are preparing to vote this month to freeze or reduce council tax next year according to public information.

Seven authorities have indicated they will cut council tax in cash terms. They are Hammersmith and Fulham, South Oxfordshire, Stratford-on-Avon, Tendring, Windsor and Maidenhead, Stratford-on-Avon, South Holland and the Greater London Authority.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill has now written to council leaders urging all councils to sign up to the freeze offer as 'an act of public service' that 'local residents will greatly appreciate'.

Council tax bills more than doubled since 1997 until last year's freeze. The Government has set aside up to £675 million for local authorities in England to help keep council tax down. Last year's freeze saved households up to an estimated £72 on a Band D bill, and this year's freeze could potentially do the same.

This is the second year the Government has offered to freeze council tax for local residents, families and pensioners. It builds on the offer taken up by all councils last year boosting what they could get over four years to £3.3 billion if they hold council tax for a second year.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles said:

> ""Freezing council tax is a concrete way councils can support residents in tough times, by keeping bills down for local families. Anything less is a kick in the teeth to hard-working, decent taxpayers which is why it is great that over 200 councils have already pledged to freeze.
> 
> ""Most councils will be setting their budgets in the next few weeks and I fully expect the number freezing to climb further. For council taxpayers who've seen their bills double since 1997 to around £120 a month they need that decision to go their way.""

Local Government Minister Bob Neill added:

> ""I know the public service ethos is at the heart of local government. Freezing council tax is a public service act in itself which, local residents will greatly appreciate, both now and in the months ahead.""

Letter from Local Government Minister Bob Neill to all English local authority Leaders regarding Council Tax for 2012-13 is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/letterlacounciltax201213](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/letterlacounciltax201213).

3. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. This year, 2011-12, the average Band D bill set by local authorities remained at £1,439. In London it was £1,308; in metropolitan areas it was £1,399; and in shire areas it was £1,484. Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double.

4. The value of saving for taxpayers by area from two years of the council tax freeze scheme compared to a five per cent rise can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls) (Excel, 63kb).

5. Local authorities who do not put up their council tax will receive a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax income. The freeze means local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £72. More details on how the council tax freeze scheme works: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf) (PDF, 32kb).

6. The Localism Act abolishes Whitehall capping in England and puts local referendums in its place. This gives the public the right to veto excessive council tax rises. Councils that set council tax increase above a ceiling approved by Parliament each year would automatically trigger a referendum of all registered local electors in their area. This year the proposed new 'local tax lock' allows people a vote to stop council tax going up in most cases if their local authority refuses to freeze bills and hike the tax by more than 3.5 per cent. Parliament will be asked to endorse the final vote threshold before councils set their annual budgets in the spring.

7. The Government's provisional funding settlement for English local authorities next financial year will mean councils have an average spending power of £2,186 per household at their disposal. £27.8 billion will be distributed in 2012-13 in a fair and sustainable way across all parts of the country - rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. It will give more weight to areas with the highest levels of assessed need. For example, the average spending power per household in Hackney will be £3,050 compared with £1,537 in Windsor and Maidenhead reflecting the fairness of the settlement. Overall the average spending power reduction for councils in 2012-13 is expected to be limited to just 3.3 per cent or £75 per household, less than last year's comparable figure of 4.5 per cent.

8. Average Band D council tax and percentage change between 1993-94 and 2011-12 are shown below:

![Andrew Stunell laying bricks in Crosby Ravensworth in Eden Valley, Cumbria, for the village's new community led housing scheme.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1950080)

With the help of the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Homes and Communities Agency and Eden District Council, local residents set up their own housing association, The Lyvennet Community Trust, in order to overcome the bureaucratic barriers holding up progress on the building of essential affordable housing.

With an investment of £660,000 by the Homes and Communities Agency and a further £1 million of funding from a Charity Bank, The Trust has created a scheme made up of 12 homes, with 10 for rent and two for shared ownership. An additional eight properties for self builders are also planned, in response to interest from local people to have a hand in the design and construction of their own homes.

Speaking on the anniversary of the Prime Minister's launch of the Big Society vanguards, Andrew Stunell said:

> ""What the residents of Crosby Ravensworth have achieved is remarkable. From canvassing the need for affordable housing to laying the first brick today they have demonstrated how community led solutions can bring lasting change to local needs. I am sure communities up and down the country will draw inspiration and ideas from the Eden Valley vanguard to shape their local services.""

David Graham Chairman of the The Lyvennet Community Trust said:

> ""We have been working on the housing project for some two and a half years and today sees another milestone with the start of build. Involvement with the Big Society vanguard has helped speed up progress and we are grateful for the support given by our community, construction team, council and national government agencies.""

The community led solutions are bringing widespread benefits to the area and Mr Stunell also visited the Butchers Arms pub, purchased by the community for £250,000 raised through a shares initiative. The community pub is to re-open shortly as a traditional Cumbrian pub selling local ales and providing a venue for local sports, events and celebrations.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1730077,Andrew Stunell celebrates Big Society in action at Manchester Airport,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell joined 100 volunteers from Manchester's Airport Community Network (ACN) to celebrate their achievements.

The Minister met with volunteers at the 'Impact 10' event at Manchester airport.

The ACN, now in its sixth year, is an initiative where on-site partners from Manchester airport get involved in community volunteering and support projects to improve the local area. This year alone they have given over 1000 hours in volunteer time. One of the many successful projects involves airport employees acting as mentors in local schools, helping students pass GCSE maths.

Mr Stunell said the scheme reflected many of the themes in the Big Society vision, and applauded volunteers for their commitment.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""The Big Society is not about dictating from Whitehall, it is about shifting control to the people and giving individuals and communities real power to implement positive change to their areas. Here in Manchester, the Airport Community Network have taken the initiative and demonstrated the real outcomes that come from working together.
> 
> ""I was delighted to be able to join in their celebrations and meet the people who have taken part, clocked up an amazing amount of volunteer hours and achieved so much to improve their local community. The Network is a great example of how people power can transform ideas into action. Everyone can be involved in building the Big Society and the volunteers here have shown how the community spirit and desire to get involved is very much alive.""

Julie Armstrong, Manchester Airport's HR Director, said:

> ""The aim of 'Impact 10' is to celebrate the projects that the ACN has been involved with and to try and inspire other companies and employees to get involved and show them how easy and how fun it can be. We wanted to encourage more active participation to get a feel for how the projects work and how the community and the volunteers develop as a result.""

> ""Good representation is the key to making public institutions responsive to the needs of the people they serve.""

The scheme aims to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds to engage with their council. Fifteen of the women were so inspired that they stood for election in the 6 May poll, four of them winning seats.

The minister spoke alongside Lynne Featherstone, Equalities Minister.

![Image: Andrew Stunell speaking to the BAME Women Councillors Mentoring Scheme](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1615398.jpg)Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Good representation is the key to making public institutions responsive to the needs of the people they serve. The Big Society and Localism are both about inclusiveness and fairness, giving huge potential for women and ethnic minorities to influence decisions. The more we give power back to local bodies, the more important this gets.
> 
> ""Congratulations to all of the women who took part in the scheme. I'm looking forward to working with partners and Ministerial colleagues across government to push the race equality agenda forward and improve opportunities for people of all backgrounds.""

The scheme paired BAME women with local councillors over a six month period, from October 2009 to March 2010 and gave participants first hand knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of councillors, serving officers and an insight into systems and procedures. The aim was that upon completion, the leadership programme would equip and motivate participants to engage in party politics.

One of the participants, Pathuma Ali, commented:

> ""The scheme gave me a fantastic insight into the life of a councillor and really opened doors for me.""

> ""This is an excellent, well-run scheme, which gives people a really good taste of public life. I'm now a councillor and it gave me the push I needed to stand for election.""

Another, Jeya Nadanakumaran, said:

> ![Image: Andrew Stunell and Lynne Featherstone with graduates from the BAME Women Councillors Mentoring Scheme](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1615393.jpg)""The scheme gave me a fantastic insight into the life of a councillor and really opened doors for me. The opportunities to network and make contacts that it provided are so important. I stood for councillor this year and have high ambitions! I would recommend this scheme to anyone.""

The event took place in the House of Commons yesterday (Monday 14 June). The scheme was launched last year by the Government Equalities Office and Operation Black Vote.

The ground-breaking programme, funded by CLG, has been helping to unlock political talent and provide a meaningful platform for black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to engage in the democratic process for a number of years.

Andrew Stunell will be shadowed by one of the 31 black, asian and minority ethnic participants who were picked from over 150 applicants from across the country. Alumni of the scheme were elected to the House of Commons for the first time this year.

The Minister spoke on the theme of 'Race equality, representation and the Big Society'. He said:

> ""This Government wants a fair society where race and ethnicity are no barriers to taking part. And we'll need to draw on the skills of everyone across the country as we respond to the varied challenges Britain faces today.
> 
> ""The House of Commons is still disproportionately white but things are moving in the right direction. This scheme will provide 30 ambitious ethnically diverse people with invaluable experience and guidance to help them make parliament and local councils more truly reflect our communities.
> 
> ""I'm looking forward to working with partners, such as OBV and Ministerial colleagues across Government, to push the race equality agenda forward and improve opportunities for people of all backgrounds.
> 
> ""I'm really proud to be acting as a mentor to one of the participants in this year's project and hope to one day sit alongside them in the House.""

OBV is a non-party political campaign group that is working to address the under-representation of BAME communities in civic and political society. The shadowing scheme will nurture the next generation of BAME MPs and community leaders.

The event was attended by people from the Bangladeshi community, business leaders, ministers and Dr. Sayeedur Rahman Khan, the High Commissioner of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

150 people attended the seminar held at the House of Commons, hosted by Rushanara Ali MP and organised by the Development Council for Bangladeshis in the UK. The organisation works to bring people together and improve opportunities for British Bangladeshis.

Mr Stunell was keen to discuss the issues currently facing the community, but also recognised the important contribution that Bangladeshi people had made in British society and the valuable lessons other groups could learn. He also outlined the Government's commitment to pushing power down to communities and to tackling the causes of inequality in order to deliver a stronger more integrated society.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to be involved in their community and have their say in shaping its future. The Bangladeshi community play an important role in every sphere of British life and they have already have shown their readiness and enthusiasm to participate in local democracy and improve their local areas.
> 
> ""By pushing power away from the centre and working to remove the barriers that restrict people from getting involved and making their voices heard we will help to create a stronger, better integrated society.
> 
> ""There is still some way to go and we are committed to tackling inequalities and ensuring that opportunities are available to all. This event has been a valuable opportunity to both celebrate the achievements of the Bangladeshi community and explore ways in which the barriers they face can be  tackled and resolved.""

The Cafe on the Hill, together with an arts and crafts studio, print and design studio and a commercial gardening business, are run by the successful Ealing-based Accession Social Enterprise Partnership.

The Minister was joined on the visit by local councillor Julian Bell, and they were shown the work of the trainees in the design and print studio. Project manager Ezekiel Ikomoni explained how the trainees had learned to master design software to create the logo for Accession which is now used on all of their branding. Taking a tour of the gardening business, supervisor Robert Brooks showed the Minister the thriving allotments full of fresh produce from pumpkins to tomatoes that will be sold at the local market.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Our social enterprises play a hugely important role in communities across the country, providing vital services that are not only relied upon by local people but contribute to strengthening the community as a whole.
> 
> ""The Accession Social Enterprise and the Cafe on the Hill project are excellent examples of what can be achieved when local authorities and social enterprise work together. Today has been a great opportunity to meet the trainees and see how the skills they are learning now will help them in the future.""

The visit coincided with the launch of a new report by the Young Foundation called _Grow Your Own: How local authorities can support social enterprises_. The report highlights the different ways that local authorities and social enterprises can work to together to achieve better value for money and better services for local people.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1920480,Andrew Stunell meets the young advisors of Waltham Forest,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell met with the Young Advisors getting involved in the Big Society and making a positive difference in Waltham Forest.

At the event, at Waltham Forest Town Hall, the Minister heard presentations from the Young Advisors on the work they are doing to encourage their peers to get involved in the community and to ensure that the voice of young people is heard in local decision making.

Since their formation in 2007, Waltham Forest's Young Advisors, all aged between 14 and 21, have been a key voice in the local community offering valuable advice from their perspective. They work closely with the Council on important issues such as sexual health and drug services for young people. More recently, the group played a pivotal role in promoting take-up of the national 2011 Census.

Speaking at the event Communities Minster Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Everyone should be given the opportunity to get involved, to influence decision making and help shape local services.
> 
> ""Today's event confirms what we know, but do not always recognise, that young people have the enthusiasm, creativity and bright ideas to make a real difference to where they live.
> 
> ""There is nothing 'big' about a society that doesn't include young people, and Waltham Forest's young advisors are showing the value of their voice and a real appetite for making an active contribution. The team are an inspiration for other young people to speak up and have their say in their local communities.""

Speaking of the benefits of being a Young Advisor, 16-year old Darnell said that it was about more than just listening to young people but actively taking on their advice and views.

> ""In that past, when we've trained councillors and how to work with young people, we've found that [councillors] didn't necessarily understand the issues or how to go out and engage with young people.
> 
> ""At the end of the training, we made them sign pledge cards so that after a few months, you can really see the progress they've made personally.""

To wrap up the event Young Adviser, Rickisha read a self-penned poem on her experiences as a young advisor and the Minister was given his own pledge card to sign.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""I'm delighted that funding from my Department is helping to inspire knowledge and enthusiasm about business amongst young people. The positive impact on the students and their communities in helping to drive social mobility is something the Government is proud to be associated with.""

The initiative brings together a range of people and organisations from across all sectors in an exciting way to help give young people the ability and aspiration to prosper and break down barriers to social mobility.

Taking part in the Enterprise Challenge encourages individuals and businesses to take a more active role in our communities and to engage in positive social action.

Mr Stunell added:

> ""I'd like to congratulate Southfields College and all the other teams on their success in this year's Enterprise Challenge Grand Final. Their efforts impressed all those in attendance and I hope will give them the inspiration and confidence to continue with innovative business ideas in their communities in the very near future.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2095541,Andrew Stunell offers £100 million boost to breathe life back into empty homes,"Neighbourhoods suffering the blight of empty homes could benefit from a £100 million boost to bring these properties back into use and provide stable homes for families in need, Communities Andrew Stunell announced today.

Seeking expressions of interest for the scheme, the Minister stressed that the funding was to breathe new life into the country's abandoned streets by bringing back into use clusters of empty homes that can often attract anti-social behaviour, vandalism and fly-tipping to neighbourhoods.

There are more than 700,000 empty homes across the country - with around 280,000 unused and under-maintained for six months or more.

Since the introduction of the New Homes Bonus the number of long term empty homes has been reduced by nearly 38,000 since October 2009, with rewards to local authorities of £64 million as a result.

Today Mr Stunell offered £50 million Government funding to areas with clusters of empty homes which have good market prospects, such as access to transport links, but require intensive refurbishment to return them to a liveable standard.

Councils who wish to apply will match the funding they receive - bringing the total investment to £100 million. Every successful bid must have strong local support and aim to bring at least 100 homes back into use.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""It's shocking that hundreds of thousands of houses sit unoccupied while people across the country are in need of a home of their own. Thousands of homes have already been brought back into use in the last year - but there are still many areas where there are whole streets of abandoned homes.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm offering Government cash, backed up by the investment of communities themselves, for a £100 million boost to breathe new life into these areas and providing homes to those in need.
> 
> ""I want my ambition to be matched by the communities that apply for this cash injection, with local people backing locally-led efforts to bring at least 100 empty homes in their area back into use. And in addition, these areas will receive further financial recognition for their efforts through the New Homes Bonus.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1800967,Andrew Stunell outlines plans to improve building regulations,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has today outlined a programme of work to improve the system of building regulation in England.

Changes will look to reduce the regulatory burden on builders, making it easier and cheaper for them to comply. The programme results from an exercise that asked the industry to identify the changes that really needed to be made, either to the technical standards themselves or the regime more generally to secure compliance.

In a statement to Parliament, Mr Stunell reaffirmed the commitment that Building Regulations relating to the conservation of fuel and power will be revised, delivering the necessary next steps towards zero carbon buildings, and considering how they may support wider retrofit policies.

He also said he would examine how regulations might be used to ensure suitable toilet and changing facilities are offered for people with multiple and profound disabilities in new developments and explore further how building regulations could be used to help improve the security of new homes.

The Minister also reiterated the Government's determination to manage this process through a ""one-in, one-out"" approach to regulation, ensuring that the cost of any new regulations is offset by regulatory savings of at least the same value.

In response to significant concerns raised by many in the industry, the Minister also plans to evaluate how the Building Regulations relating to electrical safety can be changed to lower the costs of compliance. He also set out plans to examine a number of other regulations where there may be an opportunity to not only reduce the cost to business, but also improve compliance.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""At the end of July I asked the building industry to tell me their ideas about what in the Building Regulations and associated processes needed to be improved or extended, where we might reduce the regulatory burdens and how we might deliver even better levels of compliance.
> 
> ""Today, I'm publishing the findings of that process. In the coming year, I plan to look at how we ensure our regulations are as effective as they can be in delivering safe and sustainable buildings.
> 
> ""The success of this process is dependent on consultation with those at the frontline of the construction industry, building the homes and buildings that this country needs. That's why for me this is just the start of the process - their contribution has informed my programme of work for the next year, and I want to work with them further to ensure building regulations are fit for the 21st century.""

Addressing the Muslim Christian Local Leadership Conference at Lambeth Palace, the minister welcomed the shared commitment that the leaders of the two faiths are making to explore areas where they can work together locally on issues of shared concern and encourage practical partnerships between people of the two faiths.

### Bringing faiths together

Hosted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the aim of the event was to bring together pairs of Christian and Muslim clergy from different parts of the country to discuss how relationships between their respective congregations can be improved.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Across the country, Christians and Muslims are making huge contributions to their communities in countless churches and mosques, charities and community groups. But, because they are often working towards similar goals, there is great potential for them to collaborate more.
> 
> ""That is what this conference is about - challenging ignorance and building effective, friendly working relationships, not only between clergy and imams but between their congregations. Inter faith activity is an important component of the Big Society we want to build, in which people work together for the common good and to tackle shared problems.""

The Christian Muslim Forum was set up in 2004 to improve understanding and friendship between Christians and Muslims and to build a shared public platform to strengthen people of the two faiths working together for the common good, in partnership with others.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2049563,Andrew Stunell reappoints chair to West Northamptonshire Development Corporation,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has today announced the reappointment of the current Chairman to the Board of West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, the agency driving regeneration in West Northamptonshire.

John Markham has been reappointed as Chair for a second term. The appointment will run for the remaining life of the Corporation.

This reappointment follows approval by Parliament of a statutory instrument to formally restructure of the Board of the Corporation which came into force on 17 November 2011. The Order reduced the size of the Board from 13 including Chair and Deputy Chair, to nine. Six of the remaining seats on the Board are reserved for the four local authorities, giving them a majority of seats on the Board.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation has started the last phase of its work where it has the important role of delivering some key local development projects and also becoming a more locally based body.
> 
> ""The process for change has already begun with restructuring of the Board to make it more locally accountable and the return of the first phase of statutory planning powers to the local authorities in April 2011. The full return of planning powers will be completed in April 2012, subject to parliamentary approval.
> 
> ""The Corporation will focus on using its statutory powers to take forward five key projects in Northampton which should then transfer to a local authority vehicle for completion at the end of 2013/14. Strong leadership will be vital during this period of transition and I am delighted to announce the reappointment of John Markham as Chair to lead the Corporation as it drives forward this important work.""

John Markham, Chair of the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, said:

> ""I'm very pleased to be leading the Corporation during this highly important and exciting time for West Northamptonshire. The area represents one of the UK's best opportunities for attracting new jobs and private investment.
> 
> ""Since being established, West Northamptonshire Development Corporation has invested around £80 million in regeneration projects across West Northamptonshire. A considerable amount of progress has already been made, with projects ranging from Northampton's Becket's Park Marina to Daventry's iCon Innovation Centre already making a positive impact on the area.
> 
> ""However, there's a lot more to be achieved and the Corporation has a vital role to play over coming years. Working in partnership with the local authorities, we will continue to progress a range of regeneration schemes, including the redevelopment of Northampton' Grosvenor Centre, Railway Station and Waterside area.""

The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation was established in 2004 to drive forward regeneration, improved infrastructure, investment and sustainable growth in the towns of Northampton, Daventry and Towcester. The Public Bodies Review announced in October that the corporation would be devolved into a local authority led delivery vehicle based on proposals to be submitted by the local authorities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1973362,Andrew Stunell responds to a letter in The Times about playing fields,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell responds to a letter in The Times about playing fields.

Sir,

Your reader is right to point out the importance of playing fields to communities all over the country (The Times, 22 August 2011), but the Coalition Government's policies are supporting their protection not undermining it.

The 'Community Right to Buy' set out in the Localism Bill will help save valued local assets such as village shops, libraries and playing fields by introducing a 'window of opportunity' to allow community groups a fixed period of time to put together a bid to buy a community asset - if it comes up for sale. These provisions will not force property owners to initiate any sale, dictate who they should sell to, or what sale price they choose at the end of the window of opportunity. It does a disservice to the thousands of landowners who already engage with their communities by providing playing fields to suggest that they would react to this provision by simply shutting up shop.

We are also introducing a new planning protection for valuable local green spaces - both in the countryside and urban areas. Together, these provisions will help safeguard the parks and playing fields at the heart of our communities.

> Dear Sir,

> Far from what your article suggested, social rents will not increase to 80 per cent of market levels ""across the board"" (Families on benefit 'will be priced out of social housing', Sunday 21 August). Our Affordable Homes programme will lead to thousands more homes being delivered over the next four years, as well as ensuring the mix of homes this country needs are built.
> 
> Appetite for our Affordable Homes Programme has far exceeded expectations - we now expect to provide up to 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015, compared to the 150,000 originally. As providers have bid to offer affordable rent homes, their rents have been set at a range of levels up to 80 per cent of market rent - and in London, the majority of these were well below 80 per cent.
> 
> As a Government we have been clear from the outset that these changes will not affect the tenancy rights of existing tenants, or the wider responsibilities of landlords. Existing social tenants will still pay the same rent levels they are now, and some 95 per cent of new social tenants will still be on social rents in 2015. These homes will be available to help some of the millions of people stuck on waiting lists across the country. And your article also failed to highlight how this research from the Cambridge Centre recognises how the Affordable Rent programme could ease the strain of meeting private rents for thousands of struggling families.

Dear Sir,

The suggestion by certain groups that the Government's planning reforms put the Green Belt in peril is misleading and simply wrong (Furious battle over Green Belt, Sunday, 7 August 2011).

The Coalition Government is committed to safeguarding the natural and historic environment and has made this very clear in the draft National Planning Policy Framework which protects the Green Belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and many other natural areas including ancient woodland.

We need sustainable growth to provide the jobs and homes we need but this will not be at the expense of the environment. Our streamlining of the planning system does not give the green light to development everywhere and the doomsday scenario being played out by certain groups that reform will wreck the environment does not stack up. Development will be expected to be sustainable and well-designed if it is to go ahead.

We are scrapping the top down Regional Strategies, which threatened to concrete over the Green Belt in more than 30 areas, and introducing a new special protection for green spaces that are most important to local communities, recognising the value of green spaces in both urban and rural areas. In addition, new guidance on traveller sites will increase protection of the Green Belt and open countryside.

These safeguards along with the new planning powers we're introducing for communities - the people best placed to determine what they need in their area - will not only protect, but will help enhance, the Green Belt and our natural environment.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""At this special time when the Hajj pilgrimage comes to a close I want to extend my warmest and best wishes to all of those celebrating Eid.
> 
> ""As thousands of Muslims complete their pilgrimage, thoughts of fellowship, togetherness and community are at the fore. With the spirit of sacrifice at the heart of this festival, it is a reminder to all of us of the value of charity, and helping others.

> ""These values can inspire us all to give up some time to contribute to our communities and reach out to neighbours.

> ""As you join in reflection and celebration with your friends, families and loved ones, I wish you all Eid Mubarak.""

Eid ul-Adha, also known as the 'festival of sacrifice' or the Greater Eid, marks the end of the Hajj and commemorates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son when God commanded him to do so. Muslims mark the period with special prayers and charitable giving.

Mr Stunell was the keynote speaker at the Local Government Chronicle (LGC) and New Local Government Network (NLGN) conference in London, which focussed on the new era for local authorities.

The Coalition Government has committed to promote decentralisation and democratic engagement, and give new powers to local councils, communities, neighbourhood and individuals.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Localism Bill will set the stage for the long-overdue push of powers out of Whitehall to councils and neighbourhoods right across the country, and give local communities control over housing and planning decisions. It will help set the foundations for the Big Society by radically transforming the relationships between central government, local government, communities and individuals.
> 
> ""Together, these reforms will shift power from the central state back into the hands of individuals, communities and councils. It will also give local people - individuals and community groups - more power over local government and over how public money is spent in their area, and ensure that councillors are more directly accountable to them.
> 
> ""It was a pleasure to speak at the conference today to explain how we can take this agenda forward, and give power back to councils.""

The conference focussed on the new vision for government and localism, with a number of speakers and workshops throughout the day.

Mr Stunell has previously worked in architecture so has a vested interest in how sustainable homes are progressing. He also took the Sustainable and Secure Buildings Bill through Parliament to secure the Sustainable and Secure Buildings Act 2004.

![Andrew Stunell with Dr Peter Bonfield](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1630414.jpg)

He toured the site with Dr Peter Bonfield, the Chief Executive of BRE, and visited the Victorian Terrace project, made up of three solid wall terraced homes. Developers, builders and engineers have been working on retrofit solutions to improve insulation, water efficiency and waste minimisation on these older homes, which are now completely overhauled. The skills and results used for the project will feed into new specifications and protocol guidance, and could even create new green jobs.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""Over a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions come from our homes so unless we tackle this we're never going to get the fight against climate change right. I was impressed with what I've seen at BRE, they are doing a fantastic job looking at different technologies and the kind of skills people need to use them across the spectrum - from designers to tradesman.
> 
> ""Setting the standards for greener homes is not only about creating new ways of reducing energy consumption in new buildings, it is about updating our existing homes to make them sustainable, so I'm pleased to see the BRE are excelling in this area on the Victorian Terrace project.""

Mr Stunell toured Perry Common meeting residents from the Witton Lodge Community Association, who created an urban village with support from Birmingham City Council and local partnerships. Over the past decade residents have transformed the Perry Common area, redesigned planning of the houses and the area, to create a safer place for children and pedestrians, restoring green spaces and recycling facilities.

Following this the minister visited the Perry Common Community Hall, a pilot project which transfers assets from the City Council to community organisations. Witton Lodge Community Association, with support Advantage West Midlands have created a space for the community to meet, take part in social activities and get advice on jobs and health.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1946954,Andrew Stunell visits low-carbon Coronation Street of the future,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has seen how Government plans to make existing homes warmer and cheaper to run could work on the Coronation Streets of the future.

With the countdown to the Government's Green Deal initiative underway, the Minister visited the University of Salford's pioneering Energy House. The life-sized Coronation Street-style terraced property has been built within a sealed chamber for testing ways to reduce domestic energy consumption, and can show how existing homes can be made more sustainable.

The Green Deal is a new and radical way of making energy efficiency available to all. Under the scheme, homeowners and tenants will be able sign up for Green Deal providers to upgrade properties so they become more energy efficient.

No money will be paid upfront - instead people will be able to pay for the green home improvements over time, with all the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the savings on energy bills. By allowing the improvements to be paid for gradually, the scheme will remove one of the biggest barriers for retrofitting existing homes - the cost of the initial investment.

The visit to Energy House comes as the Government published the biennial report on progress to make the nation's buildings more sustainable. A new design for the front page of Energy Performance Certificates has also been revealed. The changes will make the certificate more relevant and engaging to householders, and help them understand what action can be taken to make their homes warmer and save money on energy bills.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Over 40 per cent of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions come from the built environment, so we must make every effort to ensure retrofit schemes like the Green Deal work, or the country risks losing its battle against climate change. That's why I've come to the Energy House today. This fantastic facility shows us that greening our homes isn't just an elite pastime, it's something everyone can do.
> 
> ""With the countdown to the Green Deal underway, the Energy House will be a vital tool for understanding how measures to improve energy efficiency measures work in practice. I have argued for many years that we must close the gap between the predicted improvements of retrofitting and actual energy performance, so I'm delighted the Energy House will help us achieve this.""

The Minister also witnessed the work being carried out by the University of Salford's Energy Hub, to encourage tenants to take up the Green Deal. Mr Stunell said improving tenant engagement will be vital to the success of the Green Deal. The Energy Hub's work will help social landlords understand how to get tenants on board, and the best way for social landlords to promote the retrofit scheme.

Greater Manchester is already leading the way in this area, with social housing trailblazer projects in the city helping to get the market going and demonstrating the vast potential for the Green Deal in the social sector.

The minister's visit started with a Hindu ceremony of tying a nada chhadi (band of strings) around his wrist; applying a vermilion mark (chandlo) to his forehead; and placing a garland over his head.

The temple is a focal point for activities and support services, not only for Hindus, but also the wider local community, including schools and local businesses.

### Notes to editors

1. The Building Regulations Advisory Committee is a statutory advisory body that exists to advise Ministers on the making of Building Regulations and works closely with Government officials in the development of both regulations and wider policies on building related matters. There are currently 15 Building Regulations Advisory Committee members. The work of the Committee is concerned with regulations applicable in England and Wales. Comparable regulations apply in Northern Ireland and Scotland, which have their own advisory committees.

2. Appointments to the Building Regulations Advisory Committee are made jointly by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Wales in open competition, in accordance with the Commissioner for Public Appointments' Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies. Following the transfer of functions under the 1984 Building Act, Welsh Ministers will appoint a new separate committee for Wales and BRAC will cover England only from 31 December 2011.

3. Terms of appointment are made on merit and are usually between two to three years; there is no minimum or maximum level of membership. All re-appointments are made following performance assessments by the Chair in liaison with Department for Communities and Local Government officials.

4. The Chair and members are appointed on an independent basis to represent particular areas/fields of expertise and experience, relevant to the Building Regulations, rather than as delegates of particular organisations or interest groups. They are unpaid for their work both on the main Building Regulations Advisory Committee and associated working parties, but can claim travel and other expenses.

5. Full details of the Building Regulations Advisory Committee membership and further information about the Committee can be found on the Department for Communities and Local Government's website: [www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/buildingregulationsadvisory](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/buildingregulationsadvisory/).

6. Neil Cooper Dip Surv, MRICS, FBEng, MIoD is a chartered surveyor and currently Managing Director of MLM Building Control Ltd. Neil is also a founding member and former Chair of the Association of Consultant Approved Inspectors. Neil was appointed as a member of the Building Regulations Advisory Committee in October 2006 and has been Deputy Chair of the Committee since February 2009.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2047660,Andrew Stunell welcomes largest year-on-year drop in number of empty homes,"Families across the country in need of a stable home could benefit from thousands of formerly long term empty homes being made available, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has said.

Latest figures show that over the past year the numbers of long-term empty homes has fallen by over 21,000 - the biggest year-on-year drop since 2004.

Empty properties can blight local communities, often attracting problems including squatting, anti-social behaviour and fly-tipping.

On a visit to Redcar, Mr Stunell made clear that it was a top Government priority to bring empty properties across the country back into use, and ensure these are available for people in need of a new home.

Councils, housing associations and voluntary groups can apply for a share of £100 million Government funding to help bring more empty homes back into use. The recent Housing Strategy also included an additional £50 million to help areas with the worst concentrations of empty properties, whilst the Coalition is also consulting on giving councils the power to charge an Empty Homes Premium - worth up to 50 per cent of council tax - on properties that have been left vacant for more than two years.

Communities are also for the first time seeing the benefit of housing growth in their area. Last year, councils delivered 159,000 properties - both newly built homes and empty homes brought back into use. 353 councils are next year expected to benefit from a share of £210 million.

These latest figures show there are 279,000 long-term empty properties across England - 21,000 less than the previous year and less than the 319,000 long term empty homes reported when the figures were first collected in this way in 2004.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2097262,£10 million for English language support,"Communities Minister, Andrew Stunell today announced that the Department for Communities and Local Government will make available up to £10 million in funding to help English language training for speakers of other languages.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is making the funding available in the current 2011/12 Academic Year to support additional provision for learners with no, or extremely poor, levels of spoken English. It will be targeted at helping those who are not in employment and are thus unable to afford normal course fees.

As highlighted in the Government's 'Creating the conditions for integration' paper published last week, a high proportion of those identified as being in need of support are women with children living in areas already facing significant integration challenges. The training, provided mainly by Further Education colleges, will enable participants to communicate in English, which is vital to creating strong and integrated communities and for an individual's personal advancement.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""A poor command of English can blight both an individual's life chances and damage community relations. This fund will help to release people from the prison of not being conversant in English, give them access to the jobs market, build their self esteem and help build relations within communities.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is determined to give everyone the ability and aspiration to prosper, to realise their full potential and break down the barriers to social mobility.""

### Note to editors

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1821886,"Church groups can bond communities, regardless of faith","Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said this week that church leaders are in a unique position to connect people from different faith groups and to get communities involved in local action.

He paid tribute to the important community work that so many faith based organisations are engaged in and encouraged church groups to use their embedded links in society to put localism into action, whether it's running local youth clubs and campaigns, or simply acting on behalf of a local area.

Mr Stunell made the comments at a speech to senior figures from London churches in Southwark. Representatives from across the Christian denominations gathered to explore ways in which the church can practically engage with the priorities of the Big Society.

Church leaders were encouraged to identify any barriers they encounter when providing services to the community - such as any regulations, byelaws, planning rules or legislation in the way of community action. The Minister also asked how churches can link up with other faith groups and share their skills and knowledge to increase the positive effects of their good work.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""Churches and other religious establishments do a huge amount to improve neighbourhoods and support vulnerable people. They often have a better reach into communities than other organisations, with strong networks on the ground and a significant presence at the heart of their neighbourhood.
> 
> ""This means they are often best placed to bring local people together - of any religious or cultural background - and work with them to achieve common goals.
> 
> ""My Department can help remove unnecessary red tape or legislation that some currently face - and which are likely to be common to all faith based community projects. This, along with measures in the Localism Bill, will mean that groups are empowered to carry out their work even more effectively.
> 
> ""Today's meeting has been a valuable chance to explore the new opportunities for practical action that localism will bring about.""

There are hundreds of examples of churches and other faith communities already providing services and support beyond the limits of their congregation. These include:

  * The Springfield Project, run by St Christopher's Church, has provided a youth group, day care and family support services to a multi-faith community in inner city Birmingham for the last ten years. Their new purpose-built children's centre is run through a partnership between the council and the church.
  * The multi-faith ""Faiths4Change"" initiative helps faith communities from across the North West work together and with other local residents. By offering training and advice on issues of sustainability and social justice, they help local people improve their neighbourhoods and strengthen relationships across the community.

Today's event, attended by around 80 church leaders, is one in a series of discussions Ministers are attending to hear first hand the ideas and concerns of various communities.

Other speakers at the meeting included Jon Cruddas MP and Debra Allcock Tyler from the Directory of Social Change.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2073183,Communities have a chance to revive their neighbourhoods,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today invited community and voluntary organisations to apply for a share of £100 million that will help revitalise communities and bring the empty homes blighting their areas back into use.

Mr Stunell said that the Government cash would help tackle this national scandal, creating more affordable housing and giving a new lease of life to homes and communities.

Some community projects have already started tackling the empty homes in their area include:

  * PHASES, a small registered charity operating which trains marginalised people in South London in construction. Phases renovated a former GP's surgery in Camberwell which had been empty for about seven years. The ground floor became offices for themselves and another charity, while the first floor was re-instated as a three-bedroom flat which has been let to a family on the council's waiting list.
  * Giroscope, formed in 1985 by a group of ex-students and unemployed young people bought an empty property by getting together their giro cheques and borrowing funds. They have been working to tackle homelessness for almost 25 years, buying, renovating and letting properties in West Hull for people in housing need. To date, Giroscope has acquired and renovated 23 houses, seven flats, three offices, a shop, a meeting space and 3,000 square feet of workshop space, helping many hundreds of people over the years.

Around 720,000 homes are sitting empty across the country - with 280,000 unused and under-maintained for six months or more.

Assisted by the New Homes Bonus which rewards councils for getting empty homes back into use, more than 21,000 long-term empty homes have been brought back into use in the last year, and the community grants programme is the next step in the Government's strategy for tackling the problem.

The minister appointed fund manager Tribal - who have a wealth of experience in dealing with voluntary and community groups - to manage distribution of funding to successful applicants. Tribal will also assess applications and report back to the Department according to the criteria set out in the guidance released today.

Successful applications will:

  * bring empty homes back into use as affordable housing
  * deliver value for money
  * have support from their local authority
  * expect to be complete by 31 March 2015.

Mr Stunell encouraged innovative and ambitious applications, expressing his hope that successful projects would not only bring much needed empty homes back into use but also provide extra opportunities for local jobs and training.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The blight of empty, abandoned homes is putting strain on communities right across the country - if every empty home were refurbished and made fit for living, we could nearly halve the housing waiting list. Thousands of homes have already come back into use in the last year - but there's plenty more to do.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to bringing this national scandal to an end. That's why the programme I've launched today will give communities a chance to breathe new life into their neighbourhoods. This is an opportunity to create high quality new homes to ease the local waiting list, boost local skills and revive local pride.""

This funding is part of the Government's Affordable Homes Programme to build up to 170,000 new affordable homes over the next four years. It is expected that up to £30million of the total £100 million could be given over to community groups.

Other groups that have successfully transformed empty homes in their areas include:

  * Canopy, a small self-help housing charity in Leeds which renovates derelict houses with volunteers and homeless people. Homeless families are housed in quality, affordable homes that they have helped to bring back into use. They contribute to the regeneration of disadvantaged areas, and increase community cohesion as they train groups of unemployed local volunteers, helping them move towards work.

  * B4box, a social enterprise and building company operating in Greater Manchester and the North West. B4box provides apprenticeships in building trades - working in empty homes which offer the full range of experience in building skills, as well as regenerating the communities they work in. Recently they completed a property owned by Salford City Council which had been empty for 18 years.

### Notes to editors

1. There are around 720,000 empty homes in England, with 279,000 empty for six months or more.

2. The Department has appointed Tribal to administer the fund. Tribal Group PLC has a wealth of experience in managing multi-million pound grant programmes that target voluntary and community sector organisations and groups for public sector bodies.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1743433, Farmers should be able to offer affordable homes on the farm,"Councils should look to amend their existing planning policies to make it easier for disused farm buildings to be converted into affordable homes said Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.

The average house price in rural England has more than doubled over the past decade to over £250,000, but the average salary is still £21,000. The numbers of people on social housing waiting lists in rural areas has risen to 750,000.

So Mr Stunell has called on farmers to identify disused farm buildings that could be converted into new affordable homes for local people, and for councils to look favourably on their planning applications.

It fulfils a key Coalition Agreement commitment to enable the building of Homes on the Farm, by encouraging the redevelopment of disused agricultural buildings as new and affordable housing.

He said:

> ""Farmers are the custodians of our countryside, managing thousands of acres of rural land across England. But when they want to make disused buildings available for new homes, they can often face an uphill battle to get planning permission in the face of their council's development plans.
> 
> ""As more young people are unable to afford to live in rural areas and village schools, shops and pubs struggle to survive, farmers are ideally placed to help bring the community together to help reverse this trend.
> 
> ""That's why I want to make it easier for farmers to offer Homes on the Farm for local people. One small step for councils will offer a significant opportunity for communities to get the new and affordable homes their villages need. I want farmers to take their place at the forefront of this rural revolution alongside their local councils, to make farm buildings available, and to work with their local communities to shape the sustainable development of their countryside so it can remain a vibrant place to live for generations to come.""

National Farmers Union planning adviser Ivan Moss said:

> ""The Home on the Farm scheme is an excellent opportunity for farmers who want to use their outbuildings for a constructive purpose. It should also sustain the rural economy by providing homes for those working in it.
> 
> ""The NFU will watch with interest the outcomes of the first applications from farmers to their local councils to convert disused buildings into affordable homes and hope that councils will be equally eager to be pioneers in the scheme.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2099464,First cash for neglected neighbourhoods to bring empty homes back into use,"The first cash payments to tackle the scourge of empty homes will ensure thousands of properties are lived in once again and breathe life into scores of neglected neighbourhoods across the country, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

Almost £70m of funding for 95 projects will bring over 5,600 properties back into use across the country, far exceeding original expectations of 3,300 homes, and with £30m still to be allocated at a later date. Over half of the projects receiving funding today are in the North and Midlands.

Many of the successful projects will provide housing for people at risk of homelessness, and provide employment to local people, helping them to learn new skills. 

Although the total number of long-term empty homes has fallen to its lowest level since 2004 under the Coalition, there are still 720,000 homes sitting empty across the country - with 280,000 left vacant for six months or more.

Mr Stunell said Ministers are determined to tackle this national scandal, and in the process create more affordable housing and give a new lease of life to neglected neighbourhoods blighted by empty homes.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The number of empty homes in this country is a national disgrace - for every two families that need a home there is one standing empty. Too often a blight on communities, these abandoned homes can be transformed to provide much needed affordable housing, create jobs and breathe life back into neglected neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""So I'm delighted to announce today that £70m of Government cash will bring over 5,600 empty homes back in to use across the country - far exceeding our original target and demonstrating excellent value for money.
> 
> ""And with the New Homes Bonus, Empty Homes Premium, and £30m of funding still to allocate, plus a separate £100m scheme for areas with large clusters of empty homes, the Coalition is putting its money where its mouth is and delivering real support to bring these derelict homes back into productive use.""

Projects that will receive funding, subject to contract, include:

  * **Ashfield, Nottinghamshire**   
Almost £3.5m for 345 homes. Ashfield District Council uses a comprehensive empty homes register to map out empty properties street by street. Homes in Ashfield, Newark and Mansfield will be brought back into use through a 'lease and repair' model, and will involve the YMCA and Kirkby Trust, who help homeless 16-25 year olds move on from supported housing.
  * **Coast and Country Housing, Teeside  
**Coast and Country's project is part of a £2.9m allocation for Spirit Partnership Tees Valley for 205 homes. Their innovative project will bring empty homes in Redcar and Cleveland back into use, while also helping unemployed residents to learn new skills for employment. The scheme offers landlords owning long-term empty properties a package of refurbishment work in return for leasing their property to Coast and Country.
  * **Cross Keys Homes, Peterborough  
**Over £1m for 120 homes. Mears Academy, and the award-winning Working 4U project, will both bring empty homes back into use while helping local people gain new skills and become more employable.

Last week Mr Stunell announced a further £50m of Government funding to tackle large clusters of empty homes. Councils who wish to apply will match the funding they receive - bringing the total investment to £100m. Every successful bid must have strong local support and aim to bring at least 100 homes back into use.  
  
Through the New Homes Bonus, the Government is giving councils the same financial rewards for bringing an empty home back into use as building a new one - nearly £9,000 for a band D property. Since the introduction of the New Homes Bonus, councils have benefited from reducing the number of long term empty homes by nearly 38,000, with rewards of £64m as a result.

The Coalition has also brought forward plans to allow councils local discretion to introduce an Empty Homes Premium on properties in their area that have been vacant for more than two years, providing a stronger incentive to get empty homes back into productive use.

On a visit to the Broadway Centre in Shepherd's Bush - a charity-run day centre for rough sleepers - the Minister said the money was part of the £100million a year commitment made by the Coalition Government to prevent and tackle homelessness.

_A transcript is available to download below._

Mr Stunell made the announcement on the same day new figures showed that 1,768 people spend the night sleeping rough.

He said that for too long the figure hasn't reflected the reality on the streets, as not all councils had provided a figure. So to give a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area of the country, the Government now asks all councils to provide a robust estimate or a count of those sleeping rough in their area.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""I'm delighted to be able to announce £18.5million of funding this year alone directly for the voluntary sector; on top of the £81.5million we give to councils.
> 
> ""Charities play a key role in getting people off the street and setting them up with a roof over the head and giving them the skills then need to consider employment. It's at the heart of the Big Society and will help achieve our objectives of reducing the number of people sleeping rough every night.
> 
> ""Homelessness is a very real and worrying problem in our country and charities play a key role in providing shelter, food and support to those who find themselves sleeping on the street. That's why at the Spending Review we entirely protected the funding for tackling the misery of rough sleeping and committed to spending £100million a year on it.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2077970,Government takes next step on zero carbon homes,"Zero-Carbon Homes are a step closer today after new proposals were announced to cut carbon emissions in new and existing buildings by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.

Mr. Stunell said changes to the country's building regulations would make new homes, shops and offices warmer and cheaper to run, support growth and take England a step closer to meeting its bold low carbon commitments.

Today's ambitious measures, developed together with the construction industry, will help reduce the regulatory cost for businesses, and pave the way for the introduction of zero-carbon homes from 2016.

The proposals will also help with the roll out of the Green Deal this Autumn, stimulating demand, whilst helping to cut both carbon emissions and energy bills for householders.

The new set of Building Regulations published for consultation today will save over £63 million a year for businesses by cutting excessive red-tape and deliver safer and more sustainable buildings.

When these amendments come into force next year, more energy efficient homes will typically save householders over £150 a year on energy bills compared with homes being built in May 2010.

Homeowners will also save money with an extension to the range of simple, electrical DIY jobs that can be carried out without the need for a building inspector, reducing costs for both consumers and installers and the burden on local authorities who inspect work.

Launching the consultation, Mr Stunell said:

> ""A quarter of the carbon emissions produced each year come from our homes, so it is vital we get to grips with energy efficiency to tackle this problem. Making our homes more sustainable will also keep people warm, drive down bills and support jobs in the construction industry.
> 
> ""The Coalition is committed to being the greenest government ever, so improving the energy efficiency of our existing buildings through the Green Deal, and ensuring that all new homes are zero carbon by 2016 is a top priority.
> 
> ""But we need to do this in a way that doesn't add to the regulatory burden on businesses. So I'm delighted that these much-needed changes will provide guidance that is both fit for purpose and will cut carbon emissions, whilst also saving money for householders and businesses alike.""

The Department is now looking for views and evidence on the proposed regulations and will continue working with industry and other key partners before finalising proposals.

### Notes to editors

1) The consultation opens today and responses can be provided up until 27 April 2012, other than the proposals related to the Green Deal where responses have been requested by 27 March 2012.

2) The Government will consider the responses and aim for new building regulations to come into force in 2013, although some changes might be brought in earlier to support the Green Deal framework.

3) The consultation document on the new proposed regulations has four sections:

  * changes to technical details

  * increasing the energy efficiency of buildings

  * electrical safety in homes; and

  * changes to the building control system.

4) The proposed 2013 changes take the next step towards the 2016 zero carbon standard for homes by tightening the carbon dioxide targets for new buildings and introducing specific energy efficiency targets for new homes.

5) The energy bill savings under this Government include those from 2010 Building Regulations changes as well as those proposed in this consultation.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1991764,More power for communities to bring empty homes back into use,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today announced that community groups will be able to apply for Government cash to bring empty homes that blight neighbourhoods back into use.

Community and voluntary organisations will now be able to bid for part of £100m Government funding for pioneering housing schemes that will ensure empty properties that ruin neighbourhoods are lived in once again, and at the same time provide affordable housing. Many of these schemes will also have wider benefits such as providing excellent training opportunities for local people.

Mr Stunell said that tackling the 700,000 empty homes across the country was a top priority for the Government, and would be a key feature in the drive to increase the provision of affordable housing.

The Government will also consult in due course on plans to allow councils local discretion to introduce a council tax premium on homes in their area that have been empty for more than two years, to provide a stronger incentive to get the homes back into productive use and remove the blight from such properties on local neighbourhoods.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""There is a desperate need in this country for affordable housing, and yet for every two families that need a home, there is one property standing empty. This is a national scandal, and after years of inaction and inertia, this Government is determined to get to grips with the problem.
> 
> ""That's why I am today announcing that community and voluntary organisations will now be able to apply for a slice of £100m to tackle empty homes. With the new homes bonus applying to empty homes as well as new ones, councils can also receive six years worth of funding for every home they bring back into use. And I will continue to explore all options so it is always in the interest of councils to tackle empty homes.""

Community and self help groups will now have the opportunity of applying for financial backing to tackle empty homes, with formal bidding guidance to be published shortly. Previously only conventional housing providers could apply. Community-led schemes are already doing excellent work in this area, as well as providing valuable skills for local people, helping them get a job and a roof over their heads.

Examples include:

  * **Youthbuild in Harrogate** - the charity purchases empty homes for refurbishment by trainees under the guidance of a mentor. The refurbished properties are rented out to the trainees. This provides employment, training and affordable housing, while also giving young people a long term stake in the local area.

  * **Housing Action in Suffolk and Norfolk** - the thriving social enterprise works with the owners of empty properties - offering them a competitive lettings service while bringing empty homes back into use for vulnerable tenants.

By including empty homes brought back into use within the New Homes Bonus, the Government is also giving councils the same financial rewards for bringing an empty home back into use as building a new one - nearly £9,000 for a band D property. Already in year one of the New Homes Bonus, just under 16,000 long term empty homes were brought back into use, equating to a reward for councils of around £19m.

Formal bidding guidance for community groups who want to apply for Government funding will be published shortly. In the Autumn the Government will also publish its approach to tackling empty homes, as part of the wider Housing Strategy.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1903733,New drive to tackle scandal of empty homes,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today described the 300,000 long term empty homes in England as a scandal with four million people stranded on housing waiting lists. He said that if the empty properties were occupied by average sized families, around 700,000 more people could have a home of their own.

Mr Stunell called on communities to step up work to tackle the problem by making use of help and support from the Government. Communities stand to benefit by over £2bn if all long-term empty properties were brought back into use, with the New Homes Bonus paying out £7,000 for the average empty property.

The Minister also encouraged areas to back what he described as 'win-win' schemes - pioneering projects like the Canopy Housing Project in Leeds where homeless people are given training opportunities and a roof over their heads while they help bring empty properties back into use. The local area then receives government cash for each refurbished home.

On top of this, the Government has made a £100m fund available to bring empty properties back into use, and expressions of interest to bid for projects on are currently being considered.

There are around 300,000 long term empty properties across England. They can easily fall into disrepair, attracting squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour, bringing down the neighbourhood and causing misery for neighbours.

The Government has introduced powerful new incentives for communities to get empty homes back into use. The cash incentives offered to areas through the New Homes Bonus mean that for every property renovated the extra council tax will be matched for six years - so if ten typical houses are brought back into use the community will receive nearly £100,000 of extra funding from government. The extra funding can be spent to benefit the local community - whether on council tax discounts, boosting local services, renovating more empty properties or improving local facilities.

The Minister was today speaking to local experts in bringing empty homes back into use from councils, housing associations and charities that he had brought together as part of a week of intensive action to step up work across the country to tackle this problem. This will include a new toolkit providing a wealth of advice on how to bring properties back into use and a new on-line mapping tool that will help areas identify homes that are empty.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""With so many people on housing waiting lists looking for a home of their own, it is a scandal that there are 300,000 long term empty homes across the country.

The Canopy Housing Project in Leeds is a self-help, community housing project which was started in 1998. It renovates derelict and empty houses to create decent homes for people that are homeless. The work of Canopy has brought together lots of volunteers from the local community to learn skills, increase confidence, break down barriers and make big improvements to local neighbourhoods. Volunteers come together and help new tenants to paint, decorate and furnish their new home.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1922478,New green revolution needed to cut carbon emissions from existing buildings,"Andrew Stunell has today insisted that carbon reduction measures must be taken to ""green-up"" the country's existing housing stock to reduce its carbon footprint and save households considerable sums of money on their energy bills.

Speaking at the Policy Exchange, the Minister said that around three quarters of the housing stock that will exist in 2050 has already been built, making it vital to tackle emissions from existing buildings, as well as new build properties, to meet the country's tough carbon reduction targets.

Buildings account for over 40 per cent of the UK's CO2 emissions - a figure that needs to fall to almost zero by 2050, which is the equivalent to refurbishing a city the size of Cambridge every month.

Mr. Stunell said that the Government is putting in place a package of measures to enable a step change in domestic retrofit activity that will cut carbon and stimulate jobs and growth, but that Whitehall alone cannot deliver the necessary improvements. He argued that power must be shifted down to local people, businesses and community groups and empower them to shape their environment and promote local economic growth.

The Green Deal which will become available in 2012 will help householders improve the energy efficiency of their homes at no upfront cost. By allowing them to pay for green home improvements over time rather than upfront, through the savings in energy bills, it will remove one of the biggest barriers they currently face to retrofitting - being able to afford the initial investment.

Feed-in Tariffs are available to support homes in generating their own renewable electricity, and support for renewable heat will be available for homes. Looking to the future, the Government's policy on Zero Carbon means that from 2016, new homes will need to be built to a zero carbon standard (and all non-domestic buildings from 2019).

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Buildings are responsible for over 40 per cent of the carbon emissions we produce each year. If we are serious about a revolution in the energy efficiency of homes, it is vital that we ensure that existing as well as new homes have significantly lower carbon emissions.
> 
> ""A strong programme of retrofitting will green-up our existing homes through the Green Deal, part of our clear strategy for delivering not only more homes, but crucially more sustainable housing.
> 
> ""We need a green revolution in housing that transforms our homes and becomes the central pillar in meeting our commitments to slashing carbon emissions. The Government will put in place measures to help households green their houses - but industry and community need to step up to the plate and deliver them.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2122010,New look energy advice will help homeowners save money on bills,"New-look Energy Performance Certificate to offer practical advice for improvements

Prospective homeowners will be given better and clearer advice on making their new homes more eco-friendly, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

![Energy Performance Certificate](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2122024.jpg)New look certificate

The Minister unveiled a package of measures to make energy information on properties easier to understand, which if followed could help customers save money on their fuel bills.

A new-look Energy Performance Certificate will give homebuyers clearer information about the energy efficiency of their homes. Alongside the recommendations for improvements, the new certificates will indicate to the consumer whether they can be funded through the Green Deal.

And Domestic Energy Assessors, who compile the Energy Performance Certificates, will have undergone further training to ensure these documents are produced to a consistently high standard and assured advice is given to prospective homeowners.

Prospective buyers and tenants will also be given this energy information much earlier in the buying process, to give them time to plan how they will implement some of the recommendations included.

From April, these buyers will also be able to compare the energy performance of their home with that of similar properties, as the National Energy Performance Certificate Register is opened up to public use for the first time.

But to ensure the data is as secure as possible, companies wanting to use the Register will be required to sign a licensing agreement - which will include strict rules over how the data is used.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Energy Performance Certificate has proved useful in putting the efficiency of our homes at the forefront of our minds, but homeowners can often struggle to know how to act on the advice it gives.
> 
> ""That's why we're giving it a complete redesign, making it clearer and easier to understand and putting the recommendations for improvements into matters of pounds and pence by showing how much consumers could potentially save on their energy bills.
> 
> ""And by making the national register of Energy Performance Certificates open to the public, each homeowner will for the first time be able to see how their property compares with others, and where changes could be made so their homes become as eco-friendly as possible.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1909126,New online toolkits to tackle scandal of empty homes,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today launched two new online toolkits to help local councils and communities better identify the empty homes in their area and bring them back into use.

The launch is part of a week of intensive action by the Minister, to step up work across the country to tackle the 'scandal' of the country's 300,000 empty homes, which if occupied by average sized families would give around 700,000 more people a home of their own.

The Geographical Information System (GIS) Empty Homes Mapping Toolkit, which plots the location of long term empty homes in private ownership across the country, has been developed to allow councils to pinpoint empty homes 'hot spots' in their area, and work with the landlords and local community to bring the derelict properties back into use.

The Empty Homes Knowledge Toolkit will be a new 'one-stop shop', giving local authorities, housing associations, empty property owners, landlords and the wider community access to everything they need to know about bringing properties back into use, including the legislative frameworks, partnership building and investment mechanisms.

Communities Minister, Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Long term empty properties easily fall into disrepair, attracting squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour, bringing down the neighbourhood and causing misery for neighbours.
> 
> ""Local communities hold the keys to bringing these empty homes back into use and I hope these new toolkits encourage councils to work with them and the landlords to end the scandal of empty homes.
> 
> ""They will sit alongside the new £100 million fund we have announced for refurbishing properties, and our commitment to match the council tax raised for every empty property brought back into use for six years. Together these are powerful incentives to encourage local areas to bring more properties back into use, and create new homes for thousands of families.""

The mapping toolkit will also include information on the surroundings of empty homes, such as levels of housing needs, numbers of households in temporary accommodation, housing stock by tenure, households on waiting lists, local housing allowance levels, crime, arson, antisocial behaviour data and data on local socio-economic indices - allowing councils to prioritise areas in need of attention.

Both toolkits can be found on the Homes and Communities Agency website: [www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/empty-homes-toolkit?page_id=&page=1](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/empty-homes-toolkit?page_id=&page=1) (external link).

The knowledge toolkit is available to everyone, and the online mapping toolkit to all local authority and central government partners who are covered by the Public Sector mapping Agreement.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1737671,Rights for Travellers who play by the rules and protection for councils,"As part of a new fair deal for travellers and the settled community, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today outlined plans for improved tenancy rights for travellers on authorised council sites.

Following consultation, legal changes are set to be made that will mean that those travellers who play by the rules will get more protection against eviction, putting them on an equal footing to those living on other residential caravan sites or in council houses.  
At the same time councils will be able to take swift action against any travellers who flout the rules of their tenancy agreements and they will be able to obtain possessions orders with less risk of legal challenge.

Councils will also be able to safeguard pitches for travellers who cannot afford to pay for a private pitch and who might be otherwise forced to camp on unauthorised sites, by not allowing tenancies to be automatically passed on when a caravan is sold or given to family members.

The changes come as part of the new Government's plan to improve community relations between travellers and the settled community, which has already seen councils freed from the top-down Regional Strategies and the associated building targets; which now means that councils can decide for themselves how many traveller pitches are necessary in their area according to local need and historic demand. And at the same time, Mr Stunell is looking at ways to strengthen the powers available to councils to more effectively tackle unauthorised developments and unscrupulous private developers.

Ministers have also confirmed that new authorised traveller pitches will be treated on an equal footing as new bricks and mortar homes, with councils getting financial benefits for building authorised sites where they are needed.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""This is about redressing the balance, putting travellers and the settled population on a level playing field and bringing fairness back to communities.
> 
> ""The message is clear whether you live in a caravan or a bricks and mortar house, if you are a law-abiding citizen you have a right to have safe place to live.
> 
> ""But rest assured, we will not stand by and let people flout the planning rules that everyone else abides by, which is why we will strengthen the powers that councils have to take action against those who abuse the planning system.""

### Notes to editors

  1. Following consultation, the Government intends to commence Section 318 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, designed to extend tenancy rights for travellers in authorised local authority traveller sites by including them in the Mobile Homes Act 1983.
  2. The responses to the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/implementinghomesresponses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/implementinghomesresponses).
  3. Further announcements will be made in due course on plans to increase planning enforcement powers; measures will be included in the Localism Bill this autumn.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2040922,Rural councils need to think outside the box to deliver homes on the farm,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has today called on farmers and rural councils to ""think outside the box"" to deliver more affordable housing.

The average house price in rural areas is £250,000, yet the average salary is only £21,000 a year, meaning many local people struggle to get on the housing ladder. Mr Stunell wants to see farmers identify disused farm buildings that could be converted into new affordable homes for local people, and wants councils to look favourably on their planning applications.

Mr Stunell highlighted a scheme run by Harrogate Borough Council that requires developers to make provision on the site for affordable housing, resulting in 34 extra affordable homes across 19 sites.

Mr Stunell believes that other rural councils can learn from Harrogate's example, and wants to see other councils work with their communities to deliver the homes they need.

Harrogate's approach is in the spirit of the ""Home on the Farm"" idea, championed by Mr Stunell, which promotes conversion of disused farm buildings into new homes.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Councils and rural communities need to think innovatively and outside the box to make sure they deliver the homes they need.
> 
> ""The work by Harrogate Borough Council shows what can be done when a local authority thinks imaginatively about its affordable housing needs, and uses all the powers they have at their disposal.
> 
> ""And with the measures announced in the Housing Strategy, the New Homes Bonus, FirstBuy, plus Neighbourhood Plans on the way from April 2012, the Coalition is making sure that councils have even more tools to get the job done.
> 
> ""I'd like to congratulate Harrogate, and call on other rural councils to look at their example, and see what else they can do to work with local farmers and their communities to convert their disused buildings and deliver a home on the farm.""

Councillor Jean Butterfield, Cabinet Member for Housing, said:

> ""This is the most practical way of implementing the rural building conversion policy so that we can help bring redundant buildings back into use as much-needed homes. Barn conversions can make extremely large high-value houses. Our policy encourages a more flexible way of looking at these buildings, creating more types and size of house including affordable homes for local people.
> 
> ""A total of 34 affordable homes associated with rural building conversions have been delivered on 19 sites and we currently have four more under way. Every rural affordable home added to our stock is desperately needed and helps local people to stay in communities where they work or where they grew up.""

### Notes to editors

1. Harrogate Borough Council's Discounted Home Ownership scheme allows the purchaser to buy at a discount of 65 per cent of the market value which is then protected in perpetuity.

2. As an example, Wilstrop Lodge Farm built two large units at market value and two smaller, affordable units. The market value homes sold for £500,000. The affordable homes sold at the discounted sale price of £60,000.

3. The average rural house price is now £250,000 and the average salary only £21,000.

4. Separately, the Government has announced as part of the Autumn statement, that it intends to consult on proposals to allow existing agricultural buildings to be used for other business purposes, such as offices, leisure and retail space, to make it easier for rural business to find the premises they need to expand.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2038635,Tackling the blight of empty homes in Salford,"On Monday 21 November 2011 Communities Minister Andrew Stunell joined construction workers from B4Box - a Salford-based social enterprise and building company - at a former empty terraced home currently being renovated in the city.

Tackling the blight of the country's 700,000 empty homes and bringing more vacant properties back into use is one of the key pledges made in the Government's Housing Strategy unveiled last week.

On the visit, Mr Stunell announced details of how councils and communities can bid for the £100 million Empty Homes Fund designed to bring more than 3,300 homes back into use as affordable housing, and confirmed the allocation of nearly £3 million this year to 18 organisations to enable them to get to work straight away. A new separate £50 million fund will also be available to bring the worst and largest concentrations of empty homes back into use.

B4Box is helping to regenerate local communities across the region by providing apprenticeships through bringing empty homes back into use. All the work carried out on this project has been undertaken by a local workforce drawn from within a three mile radius of the property and all employees have had training opportunities and learnt new skills. Work on the house is nearly complete and once finished will be marketed for sale by Salford Council to key workers.

Communities Minster Andrew Stunell said:

> ""700,000 homes standing empty across the country is a national scandal that the Government is determined to fix. Instead of letting these homes fester in our neighbourhoods whilst millions are desperate for homes, we're giving councils, housing associations and community groups access to the cash they need to do something about it.""

The Empty Homes Agency's 'National Week of Action on Empty Homes' which aims to identify and raise awareness of the problems with empty homes takes place between Monday 5 to Friday 7 December 2011.

The Communities Minister also said that the scheme, which has continued to raise the standard of quality of green spaces since its start in 1996, has Government support to continue past 31 August 2012, the end of its current arrangement. Mr Stunell indicated the Government's intention will be to advertise next year for an external group to run the Green Flag Award scheme under license from 1 September 2012, and to invite bids. Details of the license offer will be available in February next year.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Green Flag Award scheme continues to recognise the importance of our green spaces and the efforts of those who look after them. 2010/11 was the best year yet for the number of awards and long may this continue.""

The scheme has just had its most successful year, with 1,290 green spaces receiving an award and raising the standard: [www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/News/Default.aspx?newsID=7712](http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/News/Default.aspx?newsID=7712) (external link). The Green Flag Community Award category, which recognises those spaces run by voluntary and community groups, saw a 13 per cent increase in winning entries.

The Green Flag Award is the national standard for public green space, currently used by 77 per cent of local authorities for green space management. The awards are increasingly being used by communities to maintain and improve the quality of precious green spaces such as parks, community gardens, woodlands, and allotments.

According to preliminary stats the page has had over 7,000 views.

Our Transparency map and timeline (see 'You may also be interested in' top right) show which parts of the country have opened their books and which are lagging behind. And with over 1,800 views, it's clear that progress is being carefully scrutinised.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""We want a new era of openness and transparency where all councils open their books to the scrutiny of the public gaze. This is not a box ticking exercise. The public have a right to see how their tax money is spent and make sure it's being spent on the right priorities.

They have until January to catch up by which time I want our army of 'Armchair Auditors' to have local spending at their fingertips.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1950704,Armchair auditors should act on their rights to inspect town hall books,"A new online [search engine](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1584&LGIL=8) launched today shows local taxpayers when they can inspect their council's detailed financial spending and ledgers as part of greater public transparency, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Every council is required by law to make its accounts available to the public for 20 days a year. This includes every invoice, payment and receipt registered in the council's ledgers. It applies to all expenditure, not just amounts over £500.

To help residents and armchair auditors to find out when they have a right to inspect, an online search engine has been published setting out the open day period for over 280 councils. Ministers have said they would like to see all councils sign up to the catalogue. Accounting rules have already been amended to require councils to publicise these little known rights to inspect.

For the majority of taxpayers the window of opportunity to see these documents is open now or due to begin shortly. Mr Pickles is urging citizens not to miss out on the chance to view their council's and fire and rescue authorities books.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Transparency is the foundation for a strong local democracy. It strengthens the hand of citizens by opening up the processes that show where their council tax goes. It helps councils do more for less, protect frontline services and save taxpayers' money.
> 
> ""For the next few weeks, Town Hall ledgers across the country are open to the scrutiny of armchair auditors. Every concerned citizen should use this opportunity to dig into the intricacies of their council's coffers.""

Every council, except, Nottingham City Council, now routinely publishes its spending over £500 online. Mr Pickles added:

> ""These rights complement online transparency. It is disappointing that one local authority is still failing to publish its spending online. I urge the press and public to exercise their legal rights to inspect Nottingham's books on the day they make their accounts available.""

**Notes to editors**

1. To find out when they can check the accounts at their council, residents can simply enter their postcode, town or council name into the search engine to find their councils details. They can choose from the options for entering your details and click 'Go'. Alternatively they can search through a map function. This service is only available in England and is dependent on local authorities registering with the local directgov team: [http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1584&LGIL=8](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1584&LGIL=8) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1954748,Audit commission to outsource audit practice next year,"The Audit Commission will outsource all its in-house local public audit work to the private sector in the next financial year, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Ministers have determined this approach should offer the best value for money. This follows the decision to disband the Audit Commission last year which will refocus audit on helping local people hold their councils to account for local spending decisions.

The Commission has already been asked to begin substantive preparations for outsourcing. The contracts, which start from 2012-13, are expected to run for three or five years giving local councils and other public bodies the time to plan for appointing their own auditors.

A fair and competitive procurement process will be run that would give suitable private sector bidders the chance to compete for the Commission's audit work in a way that gives taxpayers best value for money.

This option would also allow for the possibility of a bid on behalf of the staff of the Audit Commission which could then form the basis for an employee owned company. Arrangements are in place to ensure such a bid does not have an unfair advantage.

The Commission will radically reduce in size by the end of next year as a consequence of outsourcing its audit work. Prior to primary legislation being enacted a small residual body will remain to oversee the contracts and make audit appointments. The Commission's inspection work and Comprehensive Areas Assessments has already ended.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""We have set in train measures to save council taxpayers money by radically scaling back on the centrally imposed, bureaucratic and costly audit and inspections previously undertaken by the Audit Commission.
> 
> ""This Government is determined to refocus local audit on helping local people hold councils to account. We believe that the next step is to outsource the audit practice next year as a way to secure best value for money.
> 
> ""We are working closely with the Audit Commission to design a fair procurement process that will allow a wide range of bidders, whether a mutual or private sector accountancy firm, to compete for the Commission's audit business.
> 
> ""Outsourcing will also allow further progress to be made on the new audit framework that will give councils the power to appoint their own auditors.""

The consultation on proposals for a new audit framework closed on 30 June 2011. Ministers are considering the proposals in light of the consultation responses received and the Government will bring forward primary legislation in due course. Once established the Audit Commission would be formally disbanded and local public bodies would appoint their own auditors.

### Notes to editors

1. Around 11,000 local public bodies are audited under the Audit Commission's regime, including local government, health and police bodies, national parks authorities and passenger transport executives.

2. The Audit Commission's Board met this morning and formally agreed the process for outsourcing the audit work from 2012-13 onwards.

3. The Audit Commission will be running two outsourcing processes in parallel, one for principal local public bodies and another for the smaller bodies which fall under the limited assurance regime following which private sector auditors (as opposed to Commission auditors) will be appointed to all local public bodies.

4. Outsourcing the Commission's in-house practice will mean that many of the Commission's audit staff would transfer with their work to the private sector under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) terms. In line with previous practice, the Commission plan to allow for a significant period of consultation with local authorities prior to finalising appointments. Their procurement and consultation timetable means that appointments are planned by the start of the Annual Audit Cycle on 1 September 2012, which will be manageable as the focus of auditors work in the first half of the financial year is generally on the previous year's accounts.

5. The Commission will seek bids from audit firms on the basis of three and five year outsourced contracts. Longer outsourced contracts, five years as opposed to three, have the potential to generate lower audit fees. The Department therefore plans to engage in a short discussion with local public bodies about the trade off between the potential for lower audit fees and delaying the point at which local public bodies can appoint their own auditor once there is a better sense of the difference this makes to audit fees.

6. The Department for Communities and Local Government's Permanent Secretary, Sir Bob Kerslake, wrote to local authorities on 2 June 2011 to advise Ministers' initial view was that outsourcing was likely to offer the quickest, most straightforward and value for money option for transferring the work to the private sector. Sir Bob Kerslake is writing again today to local authorities. The Department of Health and Home Office are communicating the same message to health bodies and police authorities respectively.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1841394,Baby friendly Britain possible through neighbourhood planning,"Parents who are behind ITV Daybreak's campaign to make a Baby Friendly Britain have a real chance of making a difference if they get involved in neighbourhood planning, Planning Minister Greg Clark has told the programme.

![Image: Greg Clark speaking to Katy Hill](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1842167.jpg)Greg Clark with Daybreak's Katy Hill

The Minister, who is backing TV presenter Katy Hill's bid to get more child parent parking spaces and better access to shops, says reforms to the planning system will give parents strong new powers that could go a long way to making England much more baby friendly.

Neighbourhood planning will enable people to come together to decide what their area should look like, where new shops, offices or homes should go and what green spaces should be protected. Plans could decide the types of parking spaces stores have and influence shop design.

Mr Clark said:

> ""Parent child parking is the kind of thing that gets forgotten when supermarkets and shopping precincts are planned yet mums and dads know how important it is. I think parents should get the right to say what a car park should be like before it's built, before it's too late. And the new planning system will allow that.
> 
> ""Through neighbourhood planning, people will be able to sit down before any development takes place and say exactly what is important to them. If having enough parent child places in a car park is a priority then they can insist this is addressed and any new plan for a supermarket or shops in their area will have to take account of this. This goes for access to shops too. Parents will have real influence in the future.""

A survey commissioned by Daybreak found 75 per cent of parents wanted better pushchair access to shops and more parking enforcement to stop misuse of parent child parking bays.

For mums and dads eager to make changes now, the Minister advises parents write to their councillors and local store managers to ensure that when the car park is next painted more parent child bays are considered, and to contact stores if they are frustrated that enforcement of bays is not adequate.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1884893,'Backdoor' bin charging not allowed,"The Coalition Government is today reminding local councils not to exceed their legal powers by imposing 'backdoor' bin taxes.

In a joint letter to all councils, Environment Minister Lord Henley and Local Government Minister Bob Neill raise serious concerns that, through the Waste Review being carried out it has become clear that a small minority of councils are seeking to charge for bin bags or for the collection of normal household rubbish. Councils were accordingly reminded of the law and instructed to stop the spread of such practice.

The letter states: ""councils cannot introduce 'backdoor' bin charging for mainstream waste collections or waste disposal. Such stealth taxes are not legal and are contrary to the policy direction of the new Government.""

Section 45 (3) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 specifically bars local authorities from making a charge for the collection of household waste, except in cases prescribed in regulations.

The Localism Bill is ending the legislation which allowed for the introduction and roll-out of new taxes for the collection of household bins. The new Government has also cancelled the pilot schemes for these new bin taxes.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""We are stopping municipal officials from levying unfair backdoor bin taxes. Families pay £120 a month in council tax - they deserve a comprehensive and frequent bin collection service in return without bin bag charges on top. Bin charging harms the environment by rewarding fly-tipping and backyard burning.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs added:

> ""We want it to make it as easy as possible for people to do the right thing and dispose of their waste responsibly. Measures such as additional charging or petty officialdom simply make life difficult for hard-pressed families and pose additional threats to the environment from fly tipping and other socially irresponsible behaviour.""

Councils were also informed that as part of the Waste Review, due to report in May, the Government is reviewing the enforcement powers and penalties available to local authorities in relation to waste collection and disposal, to ensure that they are proportionate, relevant and respect civil liberties.

The review is looking at how it can work with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections; and to address public concerns over the civil liberty aspects of inappropriate enforcement practices associated with household collections.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1746796,Baroness Hanham calls on councils to be innovative in order to make savings,"Councils need to be innovative in how they manage their assets and services, said Local Government Minister Baroness Hanham.

Speaking about the implications of the Spending Review at the Local Government Group Conference, Baroness Hanham said:

> ""The productivity challenge facing councils is how to manage the impact of reduced funding by identifying those areas where savings could be made while protecting vital frontline services.""

Local authorities own over £128 billion worth of buildings and land across the country. Baroness Hanham said they needed to consider innovation when thinking about how they manage their assets and co-locate services.   
   
Some councils have already started to put this into action by creating a one stop shop for local services, putting health services, job centres, and police into one area or building. Kent County Council estimate that countywide approaches to jointly managing LA assets and other public sector assets could deliver around £40 million per annum potential revenue savings. 

Local Government Minister Baroness Hanham said:

> ""Councils must take the lead at the local level. They have the freedoms and flexibility to deliver their services in a streamlined and efficient way. By working with local authorities and public bodies, they can maintain vital front line services whilst making savings.  
   
""By working with other local authorities and public bodies, co-location of services means that local residents have just one point of call for advice and help. My department is working with local areas by setting up the 'Capital and Asset Pathfinders' that will help encourage more authorities to better manage their capital and assets by removing national barriers and unlock potential savings through cross agency collaboration.""

Other ways Councils are finding savings:

  * smarter procurement, increased collaboration and economies of scale, for example 16 London boroughs have saved more than £10 million buying ICT hardware collaboratively through an e-Auction

  * streamlining and merging operations, for example Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Westminster councils plan to merge back office services, and are exploring options to move to a single senior management team and chief executive.

The Local Government Group set up Place Based Productivity Programme to help councils challenge barriers that stand in the way of improvement and find new ways of working in response to the Spending Review (see link right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1641267,Baroness Hanham maps the progress of government transparency,"The national mapping agency is the pioneer in a new era of information transparency by Government, Communities Minister Baroness Hanham said today.

Three months after launching the OpenData initiative, Baroness Hanham said Ordnance Survey is leading the race to make public data freely available and accessible.

### Free information for all

Since April the Government's mapping agency has provided a range of geographical and mapping information for free, and developed innovative digital tools to help the public sector and businesses use the information.

On a visit to Ordnance Survey headquarters in Southampton, Lady Hanham saw first hand that OpenData is driving efficiency and boosting innovation and entrepreneurship. The free information has already been used to map the famous Elephant Parade across London, and collect road routing information to help the emergency services.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""Freeing up this public data has unleashed a wave of fresh thinking by the public sector and businesses. In just three months this new transparency by the Government has helped created a stream of fresh applications and websites that are combining free information and digital technology with the good ideas of ordinary people.
> 
> ""And this is just the start. We're changing the way Government works so more information is available to the public. We've already been working with local government to put information on spending, tenders and contracts over £500 online. Local authorities are also publishing job vacancies online for anyone to re-use and re-publish without charge.
> 
> ""More transparency will lead to greater accountability in Government. This will make it easier for local people and communities to get directly involved in issues that matter to them, and demand we work harder to meet their needs.""

### Boost for business, art, cycling...

Businesses are already using OpenData to boost their performance. Financial services companies have used the free geographic data to build ""fraud maps"" that reveal levels of fraud across the country. The maps are revolutionising the way these companies look at fraud because they show trends in different areas. Being able to see where fraud is going up or down helps with risk assessment and supply chain management as well as disaster and contingency planning.

OpenData has also had the domino affect of driving up the use of other free mapping services. The National Archives have started using OS OpenSpace to display a collection of 14,000 inter-war photos.

  * [UK history photo finder website](http://labs.nationalarchives.gov.uk/wordpress/index.php/2010/03/uk-history-photo-finder/) (external link)

And Halfords and The Great Tour of Britain have used OpenSpace to launch a unique 64-day cycling challenge circumnavigating the entire coastline of Great Britain. The free service has been used to plot the route for the riders who will raise cash for The Prostate Cancer Charity.

  * [The Great Tour of Britain website](http://www.thegreattour.org/route/) (external link)

In Cheshire OpenSpace is being used to run a road safety campaign which pulls together a wide range of information including accident hotspots to improve driving skills in the county.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1761570,Baroness Hanham praises Kensington and Chelsea Social Councils' Big Society work,"Communities Minister Baroness Hanham highlighted the key role of the charity and voluntary sector in motivating communities during a speech to the Kensington and Chelsea Social Council, who are embracing the Big Society vision.

Kensington and Chelsea Social Council work to support local voluntary and community organisations serving local residents to improve the quality of life in the area. Speaking at their Annual General Meeting Baroness Hanham emphasised the need for collaborative working between Government, the voluntary and charity sector and communities in building the Big Society.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""Charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises can have a powerful role in mobilising community action. They are central to the Government's aspiration for local people to become more involved in their neighbourhoods. Under the Government's proposal for Community Rights, they will be able to provide the support needed to bring this about - for example, building or managing community halls, or taking council services.""

The Government have opened a £100million short-term fund to help charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises to help make the most of opportunities. Overall this new fund means that the Office for Civil Society will be investing around £470million over the spending review period to directly support charities and voluntary groups.

### The people are the boss

In line with the Government's drive to empower local communities to identify and drive positive changes in their local area, Baroness Hanham outlined the priority to rebalance the state to ensure that 'the people are the Boss'.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""We believe that the state has intruded too far into people's lives over recent years and that the time has come to give them more control over their own lives. It is time for a fundamental shift of power away from Westminster""

She emphasises the role that everyone can play in the Big Society and pointed to Government initiatives such as the National Citizen Service pilots that seek to engage young people and cultivate a sense of involvement and pride in community.

As part of the Governments programme to shift the balance of power to the people the Government has been working to cut the red tape and remove restrictive bureaucracy that have acted as barriers to participation.

Visiting the Ecobuild conference in London, Lady Hanham saw some of the cutting edge designs and technology that will help build greener homes.

Ecobuild is the biggest event in the world for sustainable design and construction, and will have 50,000 visitors over its three days.

The Minister also took part in a panel discussion about 'solving the housing conundrum', where she set out the Government's plans to turn Britain into a nation of housebuilders once again.

Lady Hanham explained how a new approach based on local support and powerful financial incentives will lead to the building of more homes, which Ministers believe top-down targets failed to deliver.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""After years of top-down targets that saw housebuilding slump to record lows, we want Britain to become a nation of housebuilders once again. That's why radically reforming the way we build homes - so communities decide what gets built, and how to spend the extra cash they will receive for allowing homes to be built in their area.

Coventry and the West Midlands area has benefited from European Regional Development Funding money to support small and medium enterprises, regenerate the area and create jobs.

On a tour of Electric Wharf, Baroness Hanham met residents, entrepreneurs and businesses who have benefited from the regeneration of Coventry's original electricity turbine site. The site was renovated and converted to create a village with living space for the community and office space for more than 20 businesses to thrive. The site has since won an Outstanding Place of the Decade in the West Midlands in 2010.

Amongst the five European Regional Development Funding projects Baroness Hanham visited, were the centres of excellence at the University of Warwick. The West Midlands boasts a high calibre of Science based industries, pioneered by the University of Warwick, with partnership from University of Birmingham and Birmingham Science City, some innovative projects have been developed including:

  * Low Carbon Vehicle Technology Project, which is looking to place the West Midlands as the primary source of local carbon technology for the global market place. Working with leading car manufacturers, the project is designed to accelerate the introduction of next generation low carbon vehicles through key advances of batteries, motors, materials and aerodynamics. The project supports local and wider United Kingdom small and medium enterprises acting as a strong support to the region's supply chain.
  * Science City Energy Futures programme, local small and medium enterprises are able to tap into the universities techniques, facilities and research to further enhance their business and productivity in an energy efficient way through the following themes - electricity, efficiency of energy conversion and power distribution; fuel combustion for transport and power; hybrid electric powertrain technology; sustainable thermal technology and buildings; and energy policy.

Communities Minister, Baroness Hanham said:

> ""European Regional Development funding supported by central and local government money is having a big impact in Coventry and the West Midlands area, regenerating communities, supporting local enterprise and creating new jobs.

Amongst the innovative projects that Baroness Hanham visited were:![Baroness Hanham meets a blind man at The Elms, Cornwall](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1909915)

 

  * The Elms, Redruth, a voluntary, community and social enterprise centre. Disadvantaged, young people and the community are supported and coached back into work, through learning skills for life, capacity building, and community learning, and outreach. The £1,027,000 funding will support smaller voluntary sector organisations including Cornwall Neighbourhoods for Change, Redruth Community Radio and Cornwall Community Volunteer Services for the Visually Impaired.
  * Fifteen Cornwall, Watergate Bay, a pioneering social enterprise developed by Jamie Oliver to train young apprentices in restaurant skills, and which celebrated it's fifth birthday, 18 May 2011. £565,000 funding has helped towards the build cost, with 60 people graduating from the programme to date.

Other ways in which the fund helps Cornwall and the Scilly Isles are:

  * Broadband roll-out - providing super-fast connections to small and rural businesses so that they can help economic recovery. With the introduction of the superfast broadband, local businesses will have the opportunity to expand and be more innovative.
  * Heartland project - Transforming former mining land back into use, providing space for the community and restoring heritage facilities, due to be completed later this year.
  * Builds on investment from previous programmes in the Eden Project, art galleries such as the Tate in St Ives and Combined Universities for Cornwall.

Communities Minister, Baroness Hanham said:

> ""This funding will have a big impact in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, supporting people, regenerating communities and helping local businesses to flourish.
> 
> ""We need the small businesses and the private sector to lead our economic recovery and I want Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly to share in and lead that growth. Whether it's helping rural business through superfast broadband, or boosting tourism and helping our agricultural businesses to thrive.
> 
> ""I would also like to congratulate Fifteen Cornwall, as it enters its sixth year of giving young people the opportunity to develop skills in the restaurant industry.""

The Government is currently exploring how in addition to European Regional Development Funding we can use Local Enterprise Partnerships who have specific local knowledge to provide their expertise in business support and cultivate innovation in local communities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2112868,£1 million fund to tackle binge and underage drinking,"A new £1 million fund to give local communities the tools they need to tackle binge and underage drinking is now open, Baroness Newlove announced today.

In her latest report, Building Safe, Active Communities, published last month, Baroness Newlove announced her intention to give up to ten areas in England the money and extra resources for projects to make their neighbourhoods safer and better places to live.

Her report highlighted the good practice already out there, such as the community based projects based in East Belfast, Derry, Maidstone, and Newquay that are successfully dealing with problem drinking head on, but she is clear that with communities involved from the start there is room for further innovation.

As a minimum, successful applicants will need to set out how community groups, local residents, the police and retailers are integral to the action they propose to take. The strongest bids will also include health and education services and alcohol industry representatives and work with young people to arrive at effective solutions. The expectation is that these projects will lead to a direct reduction in local anti-social behaviour and that their experiences will be shared nationally.

In Maidstone, Kent, a Community Alcohol Partnerships Model has brought together Town Centre Management, the Primary Care Trust, Police, Borough Council and charities such as St John Ambulance service. They meet regularly, selecting, reporting and monitoring the key issues, and sharing information to respond better and faster to local challenges. Local traders have been fully engaged from the start and larger retailers supported the smaller independent stores by providing training and mentoring. The Proxy purchasing of alcohol has also been tackled and through the 'No ID No Sale' programme anyone who appeared to be under 25 is challenged and warning posters put up in pubs, clubs, local shops and off-licences. Police patrols confiscated alcohol from minors, and their details and other information passed on to the Youth Services to follow up.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""The crime and antisocial behaviour that comes in the wake of underage and binge drinking drags places down, spreading fear and anxiety in communities in place of satisfaction and pride. Everyone should have the right to live in a safe, clean environment for themselves and their children. It is a basic right and one that this fund will help deliver if enough people have the passion and will to make it happen.
> 
> ""The rules are simple. You must prove you have the backing and support of the local authority, police, education and those who sell alcohol to succeed. But most importantly that your bid has been developed around the expressed views of the local community. They need to be part of the solution and must be given a direct say in choosing projects the money supports.
> 
> ""I've seen how successful working together can be when everybody engages and there are some great grassroots projects already getting to grips with problem drinking. But I also I want to see further new ideas and fresh thinking. I want to see real team work that the rest of the country can follow.""

The fund will be available to local authorities to spend over a two-year period in approximately ten communities, with each receiving in the region of £45,000 per year. Applicants are also encouraged to indicate within their overall application, any separate community project work which, in the event of an unsuccessful bid, could receive a smaller amount of funding - approximately £10,000.

The launch of the Alcohol Fund Prospectus comes on the day the Government published its Alcohol Strategy which sets out proposals to crackdown on irresponsible drinking and empower communities to reclaim their high streets.

### Notes to editors

1. Crime and anti social behaviour caused by alcohol abuse is a widely recognised problem across England. According to a 2010 Home Office Impact Assessment, alcohol-related crime is estimated to cost £8 billion-£13 billion a year. This estimate takes into account the costs in anticipation of crime, the direct physical and emotional cost to victims, the value of lost output, and the costs to the health service and the Criminal Justice System.

2. The Alcohol Fund Prospectus and bidding form for applicants can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/alcoholprospectus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/alcoholprospectus). The Government is inviting applications, structured around  selection criteria and no more than five pages in total, from anywhere in England (rural or urban, combination of Local Authorities) to be sent to [baroness.newlove@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:baroness.newlove@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

3. Department for Communities and Local Government has committed £1 million to support this Fund, to be equally split across the 2012-13 and 2013-14 financial years (i.e. £500,000 per financial year). The Fund is applicable to England only.

4. The Fund will expect to award in the region of £90,000 to each of up to 10 communities, subject to the outcome of the bidding process. Winning bids will be notified in May 2012.

6. Community Alcohol Partnerships aim to tackle public underage drinking through co-operation between alcohol retailers and local stakeholders, such as Trading Standards, police, local authority licensing teams, schools and health networks. Community Alcohol Partnerships address both the demand and supply side of underage drinking through enforcement, education and public perception. There are now over 35 Community Alcohol Partnerships in operation across the UK.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2088542,New £1 million fund to give local communities the tools to tackle binge and underage drinking,"A new £1 million fund to give local communities the tools they need to tackle binge and underage drinking was announced today by the Government's Champion for Active Safer Communities, Baroness Newlove.

The announcement of the new fund comes on the day Baroness Newlove published her latest report 'Building Safe, Active Communities: Strong foundations by local people', which is a collection  of inspiring, yet practical lessons from those who are changing their neighbourhoods for the better, providing good advice, and highlighting some of the barriers that have stifled their growth. In her interim report to Government published in July last year, Baroness Newlove identified tackling problem drinking as her most urgent priority and she will continue to sharply focus on this in the months ahead. This new fund will give ten successful communities - based on models of grass roots projects already delivering for their neighbourhoods - the resources to really get to grips with problem drinking and deal with it, head on.

One outstanding success is Newquay Safe Partnership, which brings together local councils, police, health workers, the Local Safeguarding Children's Board, businesses, tourist chiefs, town planners, and - most importantly - local residents to share information and deliver action. In the past two years the partnership has taken steps to curb the use of fake IDs, has prosecuted proxy buyers and targeted campaigns aimed at young people urging them to be responsible and for parents not to supply alcohol to children. Since 2009, the Cornish resort has seen an average fall of almost 30 percentage points in recorded anti-social and 'rowdy' behaviour.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I am sick of the harm caused by those young people who put themselves and others at risk from illegal drinking. The crime and anti-social behaviour that comes in its wake is a terrible blight on this country. It destroys the quality of life of innocent people and in the process sucks up huge amounts of public funding to repair the damage done to people and places.
> 
> ""We need a new drinking culture in this country. I want to see responsible drinking, so we can rid our streets of drunken violence and intimidation. We need direct, effective action on the ground to make a difference, and make 'sociable drinking' the acceptable norm. This will not be achieved overnight, I realise. But we need to take action now and I am very pleased that the Government will shortly publish a long term strategy on alcohol.
> 
> ""There are many people in communities across the country - backed by local authorities, the police, health workers and the retail trade - who have found innovative ways to combat this problem and this fund will help the police, health workers, businesses and, crucially, local people to come together and tackle problem drinking head on and inspire other communities to act.
> 
> ""I am the Chair of Community Alcohol Partnerships and our Board is resolute we will share our years of expertise for activists to draw on, based on enforcement, education and public perception. A downloadable guide on their website will get any community started if they only have the will.""

Baroness Newlove has travelled extensively across the country throughout the past two years meeting local people in their communities to learn from their experience and gather together examples of their inspiring work to inform her latest report. Her new report will act as a roadmap to others, offering sources of help, advice, encouragement and practical lessons.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I've always believed that 'out there' are quiet, unassuming, unsung heroes who improve the quality of life for themselves, their friends and neighbours in many different ways. Our neighbourhoods are bursting with energy, passion and ideas for making the streets we live in safer, happier places. This report is based on real people, rolling up their sleeves and getting on with it. The reaction of ordinary law abiding people to the summer riots showed this wonderful spirit in the most dramatic way possible.
> 
> ""We all need to be able to 'pinch' a good idea from one place and plant it somewhere else with the minimum of fuss. But realize that it is just not 'one size fits all'. Anyone reading this report will be inspired and hopefully see what they can do when they leave their armchairs and get active in their own community.""

The new report also examines progress on the 12 challenges to action Baroness Newlove put to Government last year. It outlines how Departments are responding to these challenges and her thoughts on progress and what more she feels can be done.

Baroness Newlove continued:

> ""Last year I challenged The Government and public agencies to help, not hinder grassroots activists and I am pleased to note the progress made on a number of fronts, within Whitehall and beyond, some of which I have seen or heard about at first hand.
> 
> ""However, I am convinced more can be done. The cash seized from drug dealers and criminals for example  that goes to communities for them to work on making their neighbourhoods safer is welcome - but it is not enough and  I call on the Government to go further and faster.
> 
> ""Furthermore I intend to write to all candidates for the role of Police and Crime Commissioner and will ask them to commit in their manifestos to making sure community groups can use or have a say on at least 1 per cent of their budget.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2143983,10 communities to tackle binge and underage drinking unveiled,"The 10 communities that will lead work to tackle binge and underage drinking have been announced by the Government Champion for Active Safer Communities. The successful bidders will share a £1 million fund that will put decision making and resources right in the hands of local people to help them eradicate the effects of alcohol abuse that blights their lives, Baroness Newlove said.

Over the next two years these innovative grassroots projects, backed by local authorities, police and retailers, are expected to deliver real results to end the fallout of problem drinking. Other communities will hopefully be inspired to follow their lead. The projects will address separate issues that are the greatest challenges in their neighbourhoods, with measures of their success that will include:

  * a reduction in the number of anti-social behaviour incidents related to alcohol consumption
  * fewer A&E admissions to local hospitals or fewer ambulance call outs as a result of drinking
  * the consumption of alcohol by young people reducing to safe levels; and
  * a reduction in purchasing of alcohol made on behalf of under 18s (""proxy purchasing"").

The 10 successful projects range from county-wide and whole cities programmes, to projects targeting specific neighbourhoods. Each successful bid clearly identified their local problems and outlined how innovative community-based approaches would deal with them. They also had to demonstrate how their projects would be sustainable beyond the two years of the programame.

The areas are:

  * Bury, Greater Manchester
  * Chelmsford, Essex
  * Cornwall
  * County Durham
  * Lincoln, Lincolnshire
  * Maidstone, Kent
  * Moseley, Birmingham
  * Newcastle
  * Shropshire
  * Wakefield, West Yorkshire

Baroness Newlove will work closely with each of the 10 areas. She said:

> ""I am delighted that the Fund was 10-times oversubscribed, but not really surprised. I have always believed there is a seam of active citizens prepared and willing to work at creating safer, happier communities together with the agencies there to help them. This response proves it. We shall mine these wonderful examples of fresh ideas and local solutions to tackle alcohol misuse and the crime and blight that follows. In two years these areas will be transformed. I intend to support them all the way and ensure others follow their trail blazing progress.""

Among the projects that will receive funding are:

  * The City of Lincoln. Among their proposals is the development of social media to link up evening safety wardens, street pastors and local police to better address weekday problem drinking and anti-social behaviour in the city centre. They will tackle the repercussion of the rapid expansion of students and visitors to the city centre.

  * The local community in Moseley, Birmingham that wants to establish a lasting solution to the stubborn issue of street drinking and its associated problems of begging, littering and rough sleeping by giving local people a direct say in deciding how their project develops and how the budget is spent.

  * Newcastle that wants to work with young people and their families to address crime and anti-social behaviour in two inner suburbs: Elswick; and Benwell and Scotswood, where local surveys suggest that a third of people polled, consider drunk and rowdy behaviour to be a problem.

  * Shropshire, whose project will focus on five of the county's public parks which experience seasonal summertime issues around underage drinking and anti-social behaviour. The Shropshire Safer Stronger Communities Board will work with local police, trading standards and retailers to confiscate alcohol from minors, tackle proxy buying and work with young people on developing positive park-based activities.

### Notes to editors

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1893097,"Baroness Newlove joins the Department for Communities and Local Government to promote active, safer communities","The Government's champion for Active Safer Communities, Baroness Newlove, has joined the Department for Communities and Local Government to continue her campaign for a 'people power' revolution.

The Baroness will continue her work started at the Home Office and use the natural links the Department has with community groups, local government and partners with a 'call to action'. This will include acting as a champion for grassroot activists and working with ministers to raise awareness with local people, businesses and frontline workers on what they can do to make their communities safer.

Baroness Newlove published her report last month, _Our Vision for Safe and Active Communities_, detailing what residents, businesses, local agencies and central government can do to begin a generational shift in the country's approach to activism and tackling neighbourhood crime. The Government will be responding to the report over the summer, however many of the recommendations, such as more power for community activists, have strong links to the Localism Bill and the push to decentralise power away from Whitehall.

Baroness Newlove will also make her Maiden speech to the House of Lords today (Wednesday 27 April 2011) about her role and vision.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I am delighted my move into Communities (the home of barrier busting and cutting of useless red tape) will increase the pace of delivery of my plans for happier, safer neighbourhoods. This is the natural place for me to turn our joint vision into reality, and I am grateful for this opportunity to work across Whitehall too, as the voice for citizens.
> 
> ""I promised everyone who helped me with my report it would not gather dust, but it would be a roadmap for us to work towards our common goals which includes empowering local people to help find the solutions to local problems.
> 
> ""We have to let decision making and direction of resources be placed in the hands of those directly affected.
> 
> ""I look forward to meeting more community 'heroes' and developing  real, sustainable partnerships across government, agencies, charities  and more importantly 'ordinary' people, who act in extraordinary, and sometimes very brave and selfless ways to be good neighbours. And working with ministers to make it happen.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""It's great to have Baroness Newlove onboard to really drive the localism agenda at a grassroots level. She will bring invaluable insight and advice from communities that will ensure policies and new initiatives are relevant and useful for people instead of confusing Whitehall jargon. We look forward to working with her.""

Baroness Newlove will advise the Government on how to take forward her recommendations and develop further policy. Her role at the Department for Communities and Local Government will involve:

  * continuing her support for the seven activist areas that helped inform her report and recommendations
  * learning from people across the country who have helped make a difference in their area, and witnessing first-hand the very best of what works and what the barriers are to successful community activism
  * working closely with the Ministerial Team at the Department, and help them to develop policy that meets the needs of the unsung community activists who make such a difference on the ground
  * continuing her blog to directly communicate with activists and the wider public, sharing on-going learning from her visits, highlighting innovation and challenges and signposting people to useful resources
  * reporting back to ministers detailing how Government and local agencies can empower communities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1963492,Baroness Newlove meets National Citizen Service graduates in Bolton,"Baroness Newlove, the Government's Champion for Active Safer Communities has visited The Bolton Lads and Girls Club - the country's largest youth club and one of the 12 pilots for the Government's new National Citizen Service programme.

She was given a tour of the club and heard from recent graduates from the programme about their experiences and discussed their ideas for social action. In a lively interactive session the youngsters performed a role play to demonstrate an anti-bullying project designed by them as part of their summer work.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""Too many of our young people have become disaffected from each other and from society. It's especially sad because many of these same young people have so much to give back to their communities.
> 
> ""Often the feeling is that volunteering and the chance to make a difference is just not for them, when in reality what these kids need is just a little bit of encouragement and some basic skills to 'give it a go'. Listening to these young people today discussing the community projects in Bolton they feel most passionate about is genuinely inspiring.""

National Citizen Service involves schools, local authorities, businesses and other neighbourhood groups aiming to bring together thousands of 16-year-olds from different backgrounds and around the country to become community volunteers and learn new skills and attitudes to become better engaged with their communities.

Participants spend time away from home taking part in outdoor team-based challenges before returning home to work on community projects that they feel most strongly about.

Over the summer 270 young people from the club will take part in teamwork and leadership skills training over a week long residential programme before heading back to Bolton for a second residential week of team building and problem solving and learning about their community.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2076553,Baroness Newlove meets young advisors in Sefton,"Baroness Newlove has this week congratulated young people making a real difference by influencing the key decisions that affect their local communities. The Government's Champion for Safer Active Communities met Young Advisors at a project in Sefton, Merseyside, and heard the issues that concern them most and how they are successfully raising them with local decision makers.

Young Advisors - typically aged between 15 and 21 - show community leaders how to engage young people in community life, and get their input into improving local services. There is now a national movement of young people around the country with over 800 Young Advisors trained so far across 43 projects.![Baroness Newlove meeting Young Advisors in Sefton](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2076536)

A key area of concern for young people involved with the Netherton Park Neighbourhood Centre in Sefton has been on community safety and crime.

The team devised a questionnaire collecting over 200 responses and brought together those leading on community safety policy to debate its findings and establish how they could work together to ensure young people could feel safer on the streets. They sat on a number of influential panels and The Merseyside Police Authority consulted the Young Advisors on their 2010-11 Merseyside Policing Plan.

This first piece of research and the subsequent working with the local police and other agencies resulted in:

  * a 49 per cent decrease in the number of young people who had said they didn't feel safe in their own community
  * a 64 per cent decrease in those who had said felt unsafe going out of their area; and
  * a 45 per cent increase in those who said they would contact the police if they had a problem.

Following a discussion with young people from Netherton Park, Baroness Newlove said:

> ""We don't always acknowledge the fact that many of our young people want to get involved and make a real difference to where they live. They have an important voice and it's heartening to learn of the success they've had in being listened to and that their advice has been acted upon.
> 
> ""Everyone should be given the opportunity to get involved and help influence local decision making and the Sefton young advisors have shown a real enthusiasm for making an active contribution and having a say in their local community.""

Launched three years ago, the project is a partnership between community and voluntary groups and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and involves local people actively monitoring anti-social behaviour in their own areas. Every Friday and Saturday night highly visible volunteers patrol their neighbourhoods, looking out for any potential problems.

The teams have built up close relationships with local people and work closely with local neighbourhood police units, freeing up police resources to allow officers to tackle criminal behaviour.

Baroness Newlove also visited Derry in her role as Chair of Community Alcohol Partnerships to see for herself the effect of a local community project to tackle underage drinking and anti-social behaviour in the city. The Challenging Underage Drinking Initiative launched last year in the Creggan, Rosemount, Beechwood and Glen areas of the city is said to have reduced some alcohol-related incidents by 50 per cent.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I have just returned from Northern Ireland, and have been inspired by two community projects which I could only dream about. Against huge challenges after the troubles these wonderful people are creating active, safer neighbourhoods and building trust I intend to support whole heartedly the street by street initiative in East Belfast and the challenging under age drinking initiative in Derry.""

Managed by volunteers from the Briar Residents Action Group (BRAG) and housed in former commercial premises, the Briar Road Information Shop aims to encourage a stronger relationship between the estate's 1,200 residents, Havering Council and other local agencies such as the police, by acting as a single point of contact providing services and advice.![Baroness Helen Newlove, pictured alongside Briar Residents Action Group (BRAG) Chair Win Gleed, a resident of Briar Road for 40 years](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2046403)

Following a Government grant, the group - working closely with the council and Homes in Havering - are taking action on a series of neighbourhood concerns from tackling burglary to recycling and have also held a number of community events. They are also engaged with the council on the redevelopment plans for Bosworth Field to create a new community area for all age groups that will include new sports pitches, new tree planting, and new seating areas.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""This was my third visit to Briar Road to hear from local people making a real difference to their neighbourhood. It's so inspiring to meet community-minded residents who in their own time are doing everything they can to make their neighbourhoods safer and happier places to live and work.
> 
> ""I was honoured to be asked to open the information shop. I know that Briar Road residents, the council and Homes in Havering have all put a tremendous amount of time and effort in getting it up and running, giving people the knowledge and confidence to get involved for the benefit of the whole community.""

The Briar Road Estate is one of seven neighbourhoods across the country Baroness Newlove has been working closely with this year, to find out what works and what the barriers are to successful community activism.

The memorial garden has been revived and redesigned with the help and ideas from young people, who took part in Whitefriars Housing's summer 'Boot Camp' project.![Baroness Newlove at Wellington Gardens](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2021762)

### Helping young people improve their life chances

The Boot Camp course - the first of its kind to be run by a housing association - involved youngsters, some of whom, had been involved in low level anti-social behaviour taking part in a week of activities with the housing association. The course included physical challenges, CV writing, interview skills, and fundraising and community projects aimed at helping young people improve their life chances, with the most-improved going on to secure an apprenticeship with the housing organisation.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""Young people have a really important role to play in helping to create stronger happier and safer communities. Instead of looking at them as part of the problem, it's far better to include them as part of the solution. They need only to be channelled in the right direction to release all their positive energy. Their bright ideas, creativity and enthusiasm can make a real and positive difference to their local neighbourhood.
> 
> ""It's so heart warming to see projects such as those run by Whitefriars housing. Their belief in the potential of young people to turn their lives around and make a positive contribution to the local area has not only led to the creation of this wonderful memorial garden that can be enjoyed by the whole community but it has also given these young people new skills that will help them on their way to a brighter future.""

Seventeen-year-old Katy O'Beirne, from Cheylesmore, was named the winner of Boot Camp and is now a housing apprentice with Whitefriars. Speaking at the Rose Community Centre, where local residents were shown a film of the success of Boot Camp, she said:

> ""Boot Camp gave me an opportunity to turn my life around and I really enjoyed the things we did.
> 
> ""I love being an apprentice and I want to work hard because I really value the opportunity I have been given.""

The memorial garden includes a sculpture from renowned Coventry-born sculptor Walter Ritchie, who died in 1997. Walter's partner Sally Taylor attended the official opening.

### Keeping spirits high

![Baroness Newlove with Eileen and Seamus McCallion at the ](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1994326)Among the 10 award winners of City West Housing's Make a Difference Awards were Eileen and Seamus McCallion who run the Tiger Moth Public House, in recognition of the kindness they showed in the aftermath of the Irlam gas explosion. By providing food, drink and a meeting place for those affected Eileen and Seamus played a crucial role in keeping community spirits high, even hosting a joint birthday party for two of the youngest people to be affected and numerous fundraising events.

Brookhouse Community Association won the Greatest Group award. The group has provided bingo for the elderly, youth activities, parties to mark the Royal wedding and the Brookhouse Festival that saw 200 people attend last year. It also acts as an advisory group that brings together the NHS, police and Salford City Council to deliver improvements to the local community.

The Young Rising Star title was won by 11 year old Molly Moores, recognised for her volunteering work and as a shining example to other young people.

Baroness Newlove said:

> ""It was a great privilege to hear from and help recognise the fantastic efforts of so many inspirational West Salford residents.
> 
> ""Having decided to rollup their sleeves and get stuck into community activities from establishing thriving community allotments, supporting their elderly neighbours to the great kindness offered to those affected by the Irlam Gas explosion, they serve as an inspiration to us all to get involved in making our neighbourhoods safer and more enjoyable places to live. It's unsung heroes like these that hold the key to creating peaceful, happy, clean and wonderful neighbourhoods and I'm delighted the true community spirit which has served this nation so well over the years lives and thrives in Salford.""

Launched in October 2008, City West Housing Trust is a not for profit Housing Association which owns and manages around 14,600 homes in West Salford. Now in their second year, City West Housing's Make a Difference Awards recognises all those who have made a positive impact in the community by improving people's lives, opportunities and neighbourhoods.

Electric blankets, candles and portable heaters caused nearly 2000 fires and resulted in 406 casualties and fatalities over a year according to provisional fire statistics for 2009/10.

Fire Minster Bob Neill said:

> ""There's nothing like a cosy open fire or the added warmth of an electric blanket, but these and other winter must-haves like candles can bring an increased risk of fire into the home.
> 
> ""Make sure you stay both warm and fire-safe this winter and remember to test your smoke alarm every week. Working smoke alarms save lives.""

The advice comes as new figures show that a shocking viral video - depicting how easily faulty Christmas tree lights can destroy a living room in under a minute - has been seen by more than 20,000 people.

Dry Christmas trees, decorations and wrapped presents can all help a fire spread through the home in a matter of moments.

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""By following some simple rules you can ensure you stay safe and warm and if you are in any doubt over any fire safety issues, your local Fire and Rescue Service is on hand to help and offer advice.""

Eric Pickles said:

> 
> ""English counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Sir Samuel Whitbread KCVO, Lord Lieutenant for Bedfordshire, said:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1764191,Big Society vanguard puts Whitehall on the spot to remove bureaucratic barriers,"The community coalition in the Eden Valley (Cumbria) Big Society 'vanguard' want to break down barriers and remove stifling regulation to change their local area - and have put civil servants on the spot in the process.

At an event in Eden Valley on Friday (5 November), nearly 150 people from community groups took control and put their case for progress directly to civil servants from government departments, who in turn want to break down the barriers in the way of progress.

Eden Valley relish their vanguard status and have proposed some ambitious plans for the area, including:

  * the installation of rural broadband, which could benefit over 60,000 residents
  * ensuring neighbourhood plans deliver more affordable housing
  * installing a hydro-electric generator on the Eden River
  * developing better public transport provision in rural areas
  * letting the community decide how council budgets are spent.

The Big Society is a revolution in terms of how the civil service are operating. Instead of only being focused upwards on providing advice to Ministers, Whitehall is now putting those resources at the service of communities nationwide.

Representatives from government departments (including DCLG, Defra and BIS) spoke about each project, and gave people and community groups direct advice on how to navigate the various terms, conditions, rules and regulations.

This direct support will also see departments completely removing barriers where they can, or making special concessions to see that community groups can do it for themselves.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""It's local people who have the energy and the best ideas that can transform communities, not us here in Whitehall. But for too long the stranglehold of bureaucracy has stopped citizens and communities from getting on and taking control.
> 
> ""We need to stand national government on its head. We are going to work with communities not by telling them what to do from London but by listening and supporting where we need to.
> 
> ""It's great to see these exciting ideas emerging in the vanguard areas that will help us to understand and resolve the bureaucratic hurdles that get in the way of locally driven social action, essential to building the Big Society.
> 
> ""As the vanguards are showing, there is no shortage of talented and passionate people out there who every day think 'I could do that better - and probably cheaper too'. I believe they are right and it's these local innovators who need a government that actively supports them in their endeavours.""

Over the past few months, four vanguard areas across the country have been given dedicated support from civil servants to nurture their Big Society project - turning them from ideas to reality.

Their job is to remove the bureaucracy and red tape that impedes community action. Many similar barriers have been identified, including:

  * accessing the right information

  * navigating around the various Whitehall contacts and agencies

  * cultural barriers and perception problems in Whitehall.

The three village communities in the Eden Valley want to deliver better value for money solutions to problems ranging from the need for cycle and footpaths to affordable housing to high speed broadband access for every home in the Eden Valley. They have been frustrated by the various tiers of government and its agencies 'at every turn'.

Progress to date includes:

  * Cumbria is now named as a pilot area for superfast broadband and BIS/DCLG are working alongside Broadband UK and other officials to support the community in participating in the next steps
  * DCLG/HCA officials have made significant progress in working closely with Eden Valley communities and enable them to identify the local housing they need be built
  * DCLG is brokering discussions with the community and the council over how we can give more power to the community over local budgets; and
  * Support is being provided to help with the take over of community assets (e.g. pub), development of local renewable generation and community transport schemes ideas.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1643149,Bin taxes consigned to the scrapheap,"Immediate action to scrap laws introduced by the previous government to tax homeowners for bin collections was confirmed by the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman.

So-called 'bin tax' schemes would have allowed local councils to charge residents for household rubbish collections or fine families for having a full bin, on top of council tax bills which are at record levels.

Local Government Ministers confirmed that primary legislation this autumn will remove the bin tax laws from the statute books. Meanwhile, Environment Ministers have axed the funding for 'pilot' schemes for the bin taxes. Under the bin tax laws, once a pilot scheme had been introduced, it could be rolled out across the country without a substantive vote in Parliament.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Bin taxes would have harmed the local environment by fuelling fly-tipping and backyard burning. It would have created a new army of municipal bin police and forced families to lock up their bins at night. These taxes are now being consigned to the political scrapheap.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said:

> ""The new Government wants to make it easier for people to go green and increase their recycling. Rather than punishing struggling families with new taxes and fines, we will be supporting innovative schemes, like those introduced in Windsor and Maidenhead, which reward people for recycling and doing the right thing.""

### Notes to editors

1. Communities and Local Government's _Structural Reform Plan_, published on 8 July 2010, commits the Government to scrapping so-called 'bin tax' schemes by repealing sections 71 to 75 of, and Schedule 5 to the Climate Change Act 2008. This will be achieved through the forthcoming Localism Bill. The full plan can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/structuralreformplan](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/structuralreformplan).

2. An example of Localism in action: 60,000 households in Windsor and Maidenhead can volunteer to claim up to £135 worth of points a year from over 100 reward partners, at no cost to other residents. The scheme will also mean that less recyclable waste will go to expensive landfill, saving the council money. More details at: [www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1607787](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1607787).

3. The Environment Secretary is announcing that Defra will not be further considering or supporting any pilot schemes under the bin tax laws.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1877529,Board members appointed to West Northamptonshire Development corporation,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has today announced two appointments to the Board of West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, the agency driving regeneration in West Northamptonshire.

Deirdre Newham has been appointed as Board member and John Weir has been reappointed as the Deputy Chair for a third term. The appointments will run for the remaining life of the Corporation.

These appointments form part of the restructuring of the Board of the Corporation to make it more locally accountable which will see it reduced from thirteen members to nine including six local authority members, giving the four local authorities a majority of seats on the Board (subject to parliamentary approval).

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation has started the last phase of its life where it has the role of delivering some key development projects but also becoming a more locally based body. This will prepare the way for a fully local delivery body to take over its role. Excellent working with local partner organisations, including councils and local businesses, will be critical to success. In this context I am pleased to announce the appointment of Deirdre Newham and the reappointment of John Weir, who, as part of a more locally accountable Board will help the corporation drive forward this work during its remaining life.""

John Markham, Chair of the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, said:

> ""I'm delighted to welcome Deirdre Newham onto the Board. She brings a wealth of experience and community involvement and I look forward to working with her.
> 
> ""I'm extremely pleased that John Weir has been reappointed. John has made an excellent contribution to the corporation over the last six years and I look forward to his continued support over its remaining lifetime.""

The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation was established in 2004 to drive forward regeneration, improved infrastructure, investment and sustainable growth in the towns of Northampton, Daventry and Towcester. The Public Bodies Review announced in October that the corporation would be devolved into a local authority led delivery vehicle based on proposals to be submitted by the local authorities. The restructuring of the Board and the return of planning powers for applications below 200 units to the local authorities, which is due to take effect from 1 April 2011, are the first steps to achieving this goal.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1751639,Councils free to raise £250 million for underpaid workers,"More councils are getting the green light to tackle historic pay inequalities today as the Coalition Government backs workplace equality, announced Local Government Minister Bob Neill.

Thousands of historically underpaid workers will benefit as 21 councils get the go-ahead to borrow against or sell assets up to £250 million this financial year to settle their equal pay commitments. This financial flexibility is important for councils needing to meet and manage one-off costs of equal pay compensation while protecting frontline services and keeping down council tax.

Thousands of local government employees - mostly women on low pay - are legally entitled to backdated pay following years of being paid less for doing equally valued jobs.

Bob Neill said:

> ""For years thousands of hard working council staff, many of them women, were underpaid for doing the same work as their colleagues. This Coalition Government promised to fight for equal pay and work to end discrimination in the workplace. I'm very pleased today to give the green light for more councils to right historic pay wrongs by raising money on their assets.
> 
> ""By allowing councils to sell assets or borrow up to £250 million collectively, councils can deliver on equal pay compensation without affecting local services or council tax.""

Councils are well on their way to addressing historic pay inequalities and managing the associated costs of settling compensation claims.

### Notes to editors

1. The Equalities Act (2010) which has replaced the Equal Pay Act (1970), sets out in legislation that all employees are entitled to be paid equally for 'work of equal value'. Once historical gender pay inequalities are exposed, employees are legally entitled to claim up to six years of arrears of remuneration or damages.

2. Since 2006 central government has given councils permission to raise over £1.8 billion for equal pay costs under a process known as capitalisation. Capitalisation directions give permission to local authorities to meet revenue costs out of capital resources, either through borrowing or capital receipts.

3. Following Treasury agreement, the Department for Communities and Local Government is today issuing a total of £250 million in directions for equal pay back-pay to the following 21 authorities for 2010-11:

  * Bolton

  * Cumbria

  * Doncaster

  * Hertfordshire

  * Kingston upon Hull

  * Knowsley

  * Leeds

  * Liverpool

  * Newcastle

  * North Tyneside

  * Nottingham City

Bob Neill's first visit to the Thames Gateway as a Minister coincided with the announcement that Morrisons would be the new retail partner for the £600 million scheme, which is expected to create 3,500 jobs and 10,000 new homes.

The Minister praised the innovative use of public land ahead of building work. Local people are being given the chance to use and enjoy interim community allotments on what would have been a vacant site until development starts.

At DP World, the new port and logistics park at London Gateway in South Essex, Mr Neill helped name the new Stanford Wharf Nature Reserve. The wildlife habitat is 30 times the size of Trafalgar Square and already home to over 200,000 animals relocated as part of the construction process.

The Minister also helped capture several slow worms at the construction site for the new port before travelling to the RSPB's West Canvey Marsh to release the reptiles safely back into the wild.

Bob Neill said:

> ""I am extremely pleased to be in the Thames Gateway for the first time as a minister and to see for myself the scope and the scale of its transformation.
> 
> ""It's taken a lot of hard work and co-operation to get here and the Thames Gateway is taking shape, changing the landscape in many ways. World class trading facilities, new jobs and training opportunities are being created side by side with wildlife habitats, valuable green spaces and homes for the local community.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to the Thames Gateway, and to helping its people have a say in its future by stepping back and giving decision making power back to councils and the Mayor of London. We will still be there when needed - but we're putting the Thames Gateway back into local hands.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2063718,Bob Neill gives more councils the go-ahead to tackle historic pay inequalities,"Communities Minister Bob Neill has today given more councils the go-ahead to tackle historic pay inequalities.

Thousands of local government employees - mostly women on low pay - are legally entitled to backdated pay following years of being paid less for doing equally valued jobs. Equal pay directions enable local authorities to settle their equal pay commitments over an affordable period of time by raising money on their assets.

This financial flexibility enables councils to be able to meet and manage the one-off cost of settling pay inequalities whilst protecting important frontline services and keeping the cost of council tax down. Responding to requests from local authorities, 12 councils have been given the green light to borrow against or sell assets worth up to £200 million this financial year to settle their equal pay commitments.

In October 2010 the Government announced 21 councils had the go-ahead to borrow against or sell assets up to £250 million to settle the costs of backdated pay and ensure fairness for employees.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Pay inequalities of the past have left thousands of hard-working council employees, mainly women, out of pocket for doing the same work as their colleagues.
> 
> ""By giving councils the go-ahead and financial flexibility to settle pay inequalities we are enabling them to restore fairness whilst continuing to manage their budgets, protect important frontline services and keep costs to the taxpayer down.""

### Notes to editors:

1. The Equalities Act (2010) which has replaced the Equal Pay Act (1970), sets out in legislation that all employees are entitled to be paid equally for 'work of equal value'. Once historical gender pay inequalities are exposed, employees are legally entitled to claim up to six years of arrears of remuneration or damages.

2. Since 2006 central Government has given councils permission to raise over £1.89 billion for equal pay costs under a process known as capitalisation. Capitalisation directions give permission to local authorities to meet revenue costs out of capital resources, either through borrowing or capital receipts.

3. Following Treasury agreement, the Department for Communities and Local Government is today issuing a total of £200 million in directions for equal pay back-pay to the following 12 authorities for 2011-12:

  * Barnsley

  * Birmingham

  * Dorset

  * Kingston upon Hull

  * Newcastle upon Tyne

  * North Tyneside

  * Northumberland

  * Sefton

  * Stockport

  * Sunderland

  * Trafford

  * Wolverhampton.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1930682,Bob Neill hails the Great British seaside at international coastal conference,"Communities Minister Bob Neill spoke about the enormous economic potential of the Great British seaside in a speech at the first ever international conference for coastal communities.

Held in the seaside setting of Clacton, the conference discussed how seaside towns can become economic hubs and shared success stories from as far a field as France, Italy, and Malta.

The event was hosted by Tendring District Council, Essex County Council and the Council of Europe.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Event's like this are an important way to highlight to unique role coastal areas and seaside towns play in Britain's history, culture and economy.
> 
> ""Come rain or shine we all have fond memories of trips to the Great British Seaside, but they are more than holiday destinations we also need to ensure they are great places to live and work. Many seaside towns are showing how they can become year round places of business given the opportunity.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to rebalancing local economies through local enterprise partnerships and small business tax breaks as well as by putting local people back in charge of their own economic growth through neighbourhood plans and community incentives like the New Homes Bonus.""

Neil Stock, Leader of Tendring District Council, said:

> ""Businesses are willing to invest if they get the right messages from the public sector. It is up us to create the right environment for them to operate and draw in the money which will lead to more jobs and regeneration in Tendring.""

### Communities back in control

Putting local authorities and communities back in charge and giving them the freedom to drive their own economic development and growth is a key priority for the Government:

  * Through the Localism Bill, the Government is devolving greater powers to councils and neighbourhoods, so local communities are able to shape their own future.

  * The Government has invited local business and local councils to come together and take charge of their local economy and establish local enterprise partnerships. The new network of 35 Local Enterprise partnerships covers 95 per cent of all businesses and 96 per cent of the population in England.

  * Kent, Greater Essex and East Sussex local enterprise partnerships, who attended the conference, are already working together and have set up a new group to look at some of the issues facing the coastal towns in their area.

  * To further encourage investment across the country the Government is creating 21 new Enterprise Zones to be developed within the local enterprise partnerships. Businesses in Enterprise Zones will benefit from superfast broadband, lower business tax rates, low levels of regulation and planning controls, and reduced business rates.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1862275,Bob Neill on the 'future of fire',"Fire Minister Bob Neill has re-affirmed that the Fire and Rescue Service has been given some protection in the Government's recent spending settlement.

In a wide ranging speech to the Local Government Association, 'The Future of Fire' Conference he said that the economic challenge was the backdrop against which all those in the public sector are working and that the unprecedented public sector deficit meant that all layers of government including the Fire and Rescue Service had difficult decisions to make.

Overall, single purpose Fire and Rescue Authorities will see a reduction in revenue spending power, taking into account grants from central government and council tax, of just 2.2 per cent in 2011-12 and 0.5 per cent in 2012-13. However these reductions have been back-loaded to give them time to make the necessary changes.

Bob Neill made clear that reductions in funding to Fire and Rescue Authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general and that while spending decisions will be decided locally by individual Fire and Rescue Authorities, he believed that these savings should be achievable without affecting the quality and breadth of frontline services, through modern working practices in areas such as flexible staffing and shared services. In addition, the Government in recognising the need for fire and rescue authorities to maintain their investment in capital assets has increased capital grant funding from £45million in 2010/11 to £70million in 2011-12.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Challenging times of change provide us with the impetus to seek out new opportunities and be innovative in the way we deliver for our communities and neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""I know fire professionals understand the role they have to play in helping to reduce the deficit, building a stronger and safer society, and sustainable Fire and Rescue Service.""

He stressed that in these challenging times, Fire and Rescue Authorities needed to maintain their community safety focus. Fire deaths in the home have halved since the 1980s and the Government wants to build on these achievements with fire prevention and community safety remaining a priority. In recognising the value of properly maintained smoke alarms the Government has been able to continue to run the Fire Kills campaign to underpin and support local Fire and Rescue Service initiatives.

The Fire Minister spoke of the Fire and Rescue Service being one that ""we can be proud of"" at the ""heart of ensuring public safety"", and he paid tribute to the response the service has given to international catastrophes such as the recent devastating earthquake in New Zealand.

Mr Neill also outlined how Fire and Rescue Authorities were being freed from bureaucracy. He reiterated that the Government was intent on de-centralisation and on driving the transfer of power away from Whitehall to people and communities, enabling those at the front line to help set the agenda and tell government what is important in delivering.

He was joined on the visit by local MP Michael Fallon and they were given a tour of the brewery responsible for producing the local ale. The brewery itself was refurbished from an old disused dairy building in a joint venture with a local farmer and is now a thriving local business with ownership of two local pubs.

![Bob Neill at Westerham Brewery](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1927705)

The Minister then called in at the village local, the Royal Oak, and met with Fiona the tenant who reiterated the role the pub has in bringing people together and cultivating community spirit.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Pubs are so much more than a place to grab a pint and a packet of crisps. Their contribution to local life as community hubs is not only social but extends to their valuable contribution to our national and local economies.
> 
> ""We are committed to supporting the continued role of pubs at the heart of communities and want to see them thrive and prosper at a time when the economy is in recovery. That's why we are reviewing restrictive red tape, helping firms with business rates and handing power to communities to step in and take over and preserve their local.""

### Hubs of Community Life

The Government is committed to seeing the continued role of the local pub as hubs of community life:

  * Through the Community Right to Buy, the Department is giving residents the power to save struggling local pubs by taking them over rather than seeing them empty and derelict.

  * The Department has announced a review of restrictive covenants, a clause that can be used in the sale of a building that restricts the use by new owners. Reviewing the clause will give communities greater opportunity to use the new 'Community Right to Buy' power.

  * The Government has introduced a more generous small business rate relief scheme, to help half a million small firms. For two years from October 2010, small firms will receive 100 per cent rate relief (i.e. pay no business rates at all) on properties up to £6,000 Rateable Value, and a tapered rate relief from £6,000 to £12,000. An estimated 330,000 no small firms will pay no rates at all.

  * The Government is also giving local councils new powers via the Localism Bill to introduce local business rate discounts, for example, to support local shops, community pubs, or important local facilities.

### Fewer duties but more power for councils

**The Guardian, Thursday 9 December 2010**

Deborah Orr says the government is ""piling new duties on local authorities"" (see 'On other sites', top right). In fact we are pushing power downwards and outwards to the lowest possible level - so power is held by local communities, not hoarded at Whitehall.

Where councils were once prisoners of central regulation and inspection, we have unshackled them so they can decide for themselves. We have already cut thousands of central targets, stripped away red tape and abolished the burdensome inspection regime run by the Audit Commission. In the new year we will take an axe to the plethora of statutory duties and regulations imposed on councils.

Yes, there is less money around, but we are handing down more powers and financial freedoms to town halls so they can cope. We have already released an extra £7bn of council funding from Westminster's grasp and an extra £2.4bn for public health responsibilities so they can spend it where they know it's needed. The upcoming localism bill will devolve even greater powers to councils and community groups over housing, planning and on local amenities so they won't have to jump through government hoops.

Councils have more power than they have had for generations, and the only new duty on them is to deliver for the people instead of Whitehall.

The piloting of land auctions is an important part of how we will rebuild Britain's economy and encourage more locally led development.

Dear Sir,

Your articles ""Scouts promise to do their best in the face of big rent rises"" and ""Don't let town hall rent demands kill off the Scouts"" (17 March 2011) fail to mention that the government is doing everything to get councils to protect frontline services and prevent closures of scouts and other important groups.

The scouts are a well loved national institution and vital in teaching skills, social responsibility and a sense of adventure to children and teenagers. Any moves that affect them will be both unpopular and a false saving as councils will then have to deal with the social problems the closure of scout groups will create.

The country has historic levels of debt and we need to reduce public spending - councils have an important role to play but we have always said this can be done by cutting waste, bureaucracy and merging back office functions. I urge any council looking to increase rent charges for the scouts to think again.

Yours faithfully,

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/2003680,Bob Neill responds to claims that planning reforms will threaten historic cities,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill responds to an article in the Telegraph claiming that planning reforms will threaten historic towns and cities.

John Hipkin (""It's not just the countryside that's at risk, 5 October 2011) is mistaken, the planning reforms will not downgrade protections for the historic environment. They will actually make it clearer and encourage better up keep to prevent neglect or decay.

The draft maintains strong protections against urban sprawl and gives local communities the power to decide where to protect or develop through their local plan. Listing buildings and scheduling for ancient monuments will continue. Any development that might cause significant harm to an important heritage asset would not be allowed unless stringent tests were passed to justify any such an exceptional violation.

Residents, rightly, expect their council to discharge their legal duties including heritage protection and councils should set their budgets in a way that allows them do that. Despite the huge public deficit funding for councils this year was fair and progressive - the average reduction was just 4.4 per cent. Councils should look to prioritise efficiency savings or share services with neighbouring authorities.

We are already in discussions with heritage groups about where they think things could be made clearer.

Peter Hetherington is wrong to claim the government's planning reforms will lead to a ""free for all"" for development (_We need more homes, not baffling desperation_, 14 September). We have a duty to provide the homes and jobs our young people will need in the future, but this will not be at the expense of the environment. Strong safeguards are retained in the draft national planning policy framework to protect our precious green spaces and countryside from unacceptable development.

The false impression Mr Hetherington gives might be down to a serious misreading of the draft framework. We are introducing a presumption in favour of sustainable development, not one in favour of economic development, as he suggests. This crucial difference ensures this is no green light for every application. All proposals will need to demonstrate their sustainability against the strict protections in the draft framework.

Claims that the government has undermined construction by scrapping regional spatial strategies do not stack up. The reality is that top-down targets imposed on communities have led to the lowest house-building levels in any peacetime year since 1924. This government is putting power back into the hands of local people to decide the places they wish to see developed and those protected, through their local plans. These will be sovereign in future without the threat of being overruled by regional agencies and will, indeed, put communities in the driving seat of decision-making.

Sir - You report (September 7) that planners have already been told to start approving developments on the basis of the Coalition's planning guidelines.

But the draft framework is not new legislation; it will only become national policy after the consultation period, when a final text, taking account of responses, will be published. The planning inspectorate simply sent guidance to its inspectors, as is normal when a draft policy is out for consultation, to ensure they are aware of it and treat it consistently when dealing with live cases. Ministers and the inspectorate have agreed that the framework is considered as a draft by inspectors.

We have a slow and bureaucratic planning system that costs the economy £3billion a year. Reform is imperative for our economic recovery. By combining all planning policies into one concise document we can create a clearer system.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill today said it is time for a culture change across Whitehall and local government to ensure that localism - the real devolution of power to local people - takes place.

![embed: ](http://www.policyreview.tv/newplayer/player805.swf)

He said change is needed at a time of financial pressure for local government, especially when it accounts for almost a quarter of UK public sector spending.

Bob Neill highlighted that these challenges are not mere problems but a mandate for radical change, and that we need a strong society where individuals, families and communities are more able to take on responsibility to improve their areas.

He said:

> ""The old rules of central control are not a fixed part of the system - we need to change the culture to enable us to rewrite the rules. We want local deliverers to be much more accountable to the people they serve rather than focussing on Whitehall.
> 
> ""The tired, old bureaucratic approach needs to go and the balance of power between central and local government needs to be reset. It's time to build a new system around our trust in people and professionals.
> 
> ""Strong local government ultimately comes from rising voter turnout. Success will be further recognised when local citizens and national media routinely ask locally elected leaders for answers and not Ministers in Parliament.
> 
> ""Decentralisation needs to happen by moving decision making down through the town hall, starting with individuals, families, communities and voluntary groups. It's not about which type of politician is in charge. Hard questions have to be asked by everyone about how far power can be transferred to put people fully in charge of their own destinies.""

The Great British Beer festival attracts thousands of thirsty punters each year to celebrate the great British pub and sample the huge selection of beers, ciders and ales that are brewed across the country. The Great British Beer Festival celebrates all that's traditional about the 'local' including pub grub, live music and traditional pub games like shove ha'penny, bar billiards, skittles and darts. At yesterday's event the Mighty Oak brewery's beer 'Oscar Wilde' was crowned 'best beer' in Britain.

### Hubs of community life

Speaking to an audience from the beer and pub industry, Mr Neill emphasised the importance of the pub as a hub of community life, as important to the local social scene as to the local economy.  
   
He said:

> ""Pubs are hubs of community life, as important to the local social scene as they are to the local economy. Throughout their rich and diverse history they have proved themselves to be resilient, enterprising and full of initiative. But time is being called at too many of our 'locals', depriving people of treasured places to get together in the community.  
> 
> ""We are putting the people back in charge, giving them the power to step in and save their much loved community assets. Communities across the country are already stepping in to save their pub from closure. By reviewing this restrictive red tape we are giving people another opportunity to use their collective powers to ensure that their locals remain local and continue to thrive at the heart of the community.""

Mike Benner, Chief Executive of Campaign for Real Ale said:

> ""Campaign for Real Ale wholeheartedly welcomes this announcement of a government consultation on the use of restrictive covenants - it's a great success for localism, and shows that government recognises that pubs are vital community assets that need to be protected. For the new community right to buy scheme being introduced as part of the Localism Bill to work, pubs need to be available for communities to keep open.
> 
> ""It's a victory too for people power: this proposal came from communities on the ground, via their local councils who put the proposals to central government.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1868301,Bob Neill sees how private enterprise is driving Thames Gateway growth,"Thames Gateway Minister Bob Neill has visited London's Docklands to see how private investment is supporting the local economy.

His first stop was ExCeL, host to boxing, judo, taekwondo, table tennis, weightlifting and wrestling events for next year's Olympic games. This international conference centre is set to contribute £1.6bn to the economy in 2011 alone and will support 38,000 jobs. Mr Neill also saw construction of the new £65m hotel next door, already fully booked for the Olympics.

At the University of East London's Docklands campus he saw how they were developing students' skills and supporting entrepreneurship with their Knowledge Dock Business Centre. He met entrepreneur Jim Shaikh, who started Yoomi - a self-warming baby bottle business - at the centre and is now expanding into America and other international markets, projected turnover is £1m per annum.

At London City Airport the minister heard how it's supporting the local job market with over 60 per cent of its employees from within five miles of the airport. Over the last 18 months the airport's award winning Take Off Into Work Programme has helped get 130 people back into work from long term unemployment.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Visiting London's Docklands has let me see first hand how the private-sector continues to be a real driving force behind local growth in the Thames Gateway. The expansion of ExCeL as a world-class conference venue, where 65 per cent of employees come from East London, is set to benefit by the UK economy by £1.6bn this year alone.
> 
> ""The first class City Airport's investment plans will create more than 2,500 new jobs over the next 20 years, and London's newest university is helping to create a new generation of entrepreneurs who, with the support of the university's award winning business incubator - the Knowledge Dock - are building their own local businesses, from creative industries and e-learning to bio-technology and healthcare.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1959609,Bob Neill sees Olympic preparations in Weymouth,"Olympic Legacy minister Bob Neill has visited Weymouth and Portland to see the improvements the area is benefitting from thanks to the 2012 Olympic Games.

The minister was given a tour of the Olympic sailing site on the first day of its two-week regatta event, which is being held as a practice-run for next year's games. He heard that the Games were strengthening the area's reputation as a world-class sailing venue and how they were bringing new business investment, infrastructure, homes and jobs into the area.

Mr Neill said:

> ""This government is very keen there is tangible Olympic legacy for people, their family and friends for the future. The Games will re-inforce Weymouth and Portland as a premier sailing venue, the Olympic Village will significantly boost the amount of affordable housing when it's converted and the super-fast broadband will also be important for attracting business.""

He also met with Dorset Fire and Rescue service in his role as Fire and Resilience minister, to find out how they were preparing for the Games. He saw Weymouth's new Community Fire Station, which offers space for the community to use alongside its fire prevention services. The minister said that the mixed-use station was an excellent way for the Service to make the local community more aware of fire risk.

He said:

> ""This is a fantastic example of the Fire and Rescue Service putting itself at the heart of its local community, providing local people with an up-to-date facility for their own use, from education and health groups to social events. This is a really impressive resource of which the people of Weymouth can be justifiably proud.
> 
> ""We continue to be committed to improving frontline services, and investing in 21st Century fire stations in the right locations. Weymouth's new facility will both help save lives and deliver a local service that meets the needs of the community. Dorset Fire and Rescue Service is clearly punching well above its weight

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1622580,Bob Neill set outs the future of local planning,"Planning Minister Bob Neill has called on the planning profession to lead the revolution to put power back into the hands of local people.

Speaking at the National Planning Forum, Mr Neill set out the Government's vision for the future where councils and local people work together with developers and planners to deliver new building in their area.

### Localism, localism, localism

The expert audience, which included council staff, planners, developers and charities, heard how the end of top-down regional targets by unaccountable quangos and bureaucrats would herald a new era in planning.

Planning Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""We're abolishing this ridiculous system where Whitehall tells communities what they must build, and then dictates when and where they have to build it. Those who make planning decisions will no longer be able to avoid reporting back to those whose lives are directly affected by them.
> 
> ""Communities will be able to come together and take responsibility for solving their own local challenges in a way that make sense for them. And in return, they will be offered powerful incentives that ensure they see the benefits of the development they welcome.
> 
> ""But we can't return to localism simply by changing the rules. We need your help to make this work. Planning has its roots in a democratic system that engages local communities. You were there at the beginning, and you will be there again to give communities the real power and real influence they deserve.""

### A new way of working

Mr Neill explained how planning policy would be streamlined and simplified, to free up local authorities and communities to make their own decisions.

He also went on to set out the challenges ahead for planners, councillors and developers. In the future planners will not just be planning experts, but experts at working with communities, and translating their visions into action.

Local plans will be more transparent and spell put how they will benefit the community. Communities will help develop proposals for their neighbourhoods, rather than be consulted on 'options' that have already been prepared.

And local, long-term plans will become more important. If a new development is in the plan that is supported by local people, a proposal in line with that plan will be approved unless there are significant reasons against it.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1979448,Bob Neill wants views on the future of the Fire Service college,"In a statement published today Fire Minister Bob Neill has asked for views on the future of the Fire Service College. He announced that the Government wants to explore options for a new ownership, operational and governance model for the College through greater involvement from other sectors, including voluntary organisations and the private sector. The Written Minsiterial Statement is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/fireservicecollegefuture](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/fireservicecollegefuture).

The College, located in Moreton-in the-Marsh, Gloucestershire is a leading provider of specialist training to the Fire and Rescue sector. However, the current Fire Service College ownership and business arrangements do not provide the flexibility necessary for the College to operate with sufficient commercial success and the Government is launching this exercise in order to inform its view of market appetite and viable options. The pre-market engagement document is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fscpremarketengagement](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fscpremarketengagement).

This will allow any interested parties to offer clear views on the future of the College, and the Department to assess the reaction of the market to the aim of delivering a new model for the Fire Service College. The Government's preferred option for a Fire Service College of the future is a partnership between the public and private sectors with the fire sector playing a key role in that partnership. Whilst this is the preferred option, all options will be considered and any ideas on whether other arrangements may be more suitable are welcome.

Sir,

Contrary to suggestions in Alice Thomson's article (Opinion, Sept 28) the coalition Government is firmly committed to supporting our town centres. Our planning reforms actually safeguard a ""town centre first"" policy for new retail development to help to protect the high street. It states clearly that councils should recognise town centres as the heart of their communities and should pursue policies to allow them to thrive.

Strengthening our town centres goes hand-in-hand with reforms to make the planning system work in the interests of all our communities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2100221,Backdated port tax burden finally lifted,"Port-based businesses facing unfair and unexpected backdated business rates bills can breathe a sigh of relief, Local Government Minister Bob Neill said today, as Government action to waive and repay their bills has finally lifted their heavy debt burden.

![Bob Neill visiting AB Ports in Ipswich](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2100279.jpg)Bob Neill at AB Ports in Ipswich

Visiting AB Ports in Ipswich, Mr Neill said that the Government's work to support port businesses - the backbone of Britain's global export industry - has already helped them continue to thrive and grow, and that they would now be able to move forward confidently without the unexpected return of extortionate business rate bills.

A review of ports by the Valuation Office Agency in 2008 meant that many port-based companies faced business rates bills backdated to 1 April 2005, cumulatively reaching into the millions. Many businesses campaigned against the demands as they were seriously damaging the industry's competitive advantage.

Government action to cancel these unfair, retrospective rates bills means that port-based businesses can now either scratch the debt entirely from their records or, if they had paid their bills already, expect a rebate in the near future. The policy will also benefit businesses outside of ports, which meet the criteria.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""For too long this unfair backdated port tax took its toll the port industry, with unexpected million pound bills damaging the businesses at the foundation of this country's import and export infrastructure.
> 
> ""The Government took swift action to reverse these effects - our freeze on paying the backdated tax helped prevent job losses and let companies plan for the future. And from 31 March, affected businesses in ports and across England, can at last breathe a sigh of relief as our action to waive their bills is completed.
> 
> ""Now the looming threat of the unfair backdated port tax is finally behind us, I'm confident that the industry can move forward with putting that money to its rightful use - to build up their businesses, retain jobs and benefit from international trade.""

David Pendleton, Business Development Director for Mersey Maritime said:

> ""Mersey Maritime has been closely involved with this campaign from the very start, helping to bring together the Mersey Dock Rating group and working with other affected port based businesses around the UK. We are delighted to see our combined efforts come to fruition with the lifting of this grossly unfair financial burden.
> 
> ""At least 70 firms and 3000 jobs were estimated to be under threat on Merseyside and this in the midst of the worst recession in living memory. The Government's determined effort in first freezing backdated payments and now removing them altogether means that these companies can finally concentrate on moving forward and creating jobs and wealth for the wider economy, which is vital at this time.""

Kieran Hall, Managing Director of Denholm Handling and Chair of Mersey Dock Rating Group added:

> ""The current Government has been totally consistent in its approach to resolving this matter, even prior to taking office, which gave all of the affected businesses the confidence that a positive outcome would eventually be reached. That point has now been reached and we are immensely grateful.""

### Notes to editor

1. Until 2008, a number of businesses in each of the 55 statutory ports in England (approximately 700) and Wales, understood that they were not individually liable for businesses rates, as they believed that there was a combined bill that was paid by each port operator (their landlords) on behalf of all the firms within it.

2. Following a review the Valuation Office Agency decided that each firm must each pay an individual business rate bill, declaring them all 'separate occupations'. The Agency retrospectively backdated the rating list, which led to new tax bills for local firms to 2005, as required by legislation.

3. From 31 March, affected businesses will be able to either waive or reclaim the bills incurred under the 'port tax'.

4. In Wales, this is within the remit of the Welsh Assembly Government. Wales has been given funding under the Barnett formula to reduce bills for firms in Welsh ports. However, the Welsh Assembly Government has resolved not to pass on these tax cuts.

5. Estimated value of the waived tax bills across England will total more than £66 million. A full list of estimated waived bills is below:

  
  


These figures are based upon Valuation Office Agency data as at 30 April 2010. The number of properties and rates cancelled may reduce by:

  * appeals that have been subsequently determined
  * the actual levels of relief granted are greater than the general assumption
  * companies who have gone bust will not receive a refund
  * these figures are maximum limits because the data accounts for only one of the eligibility criteria (backdated liability of more than 33 months)

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2075337,Cash injection to support coalfield communities into the future,"Communities Minister Bob Neill has today confirmed a further £22million to help former coalfield communities get back on their feet and secure economic growth for years to come.

The funding will be allocated to the Coalfields Regeneration Trust over two years to 2015 and will be used to transform it into a self-sustaining organisation so it can continue to champion the interests and needs of coalfield communities - without being reliant on Government funding.

This £22 million cash injection is on top of the £30 million already confirmed for this year and next.

Today's announcement comes as the Coalfields Regeneration Trust launches a new Skills Factory in East Kent, to help local people into new employment.

Backed with £200,000 funding from the Trust, the Skills Factory based in Aylesham will help provide training in sought-after skills to meet local demand.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""I am delighted to be able to announce a further £22 million to secure the long-term future of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust. We will be looking to the Trust to move its focus quickly to generating its own income streams. Its work is vital in supporting former coalfield areas as local people look to develop new skills and start new careers.
> 
> ""The launch of today's Skills Factory in East Kent is another shining example of the Trust's work - helping people into work in an area still blighted by long-term unemployment. I look forward to seeing the fruits of the Trust's labours as they look to secure the long-term economic future of these former coalfield areas.""

Peter McNestry Chair of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust said:

> ""The Coalfields Regeneration Trust is pleased to be given the opportunity to continue its valuable and much needed work in coalfield communities. This further Government funding will enable us to work hard to secure the Trust's long term sustainability. We're looking forward to the challenge of a new way of working and will continue to provide real opportunities to coalfield residents to improve their lives and their communities.""

### Notes to editors

1. Grant Shapps announced £30 million on 10 March 2011 to support the work of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust. This was for first two years of the Spending Review Period (2011/12 and 2012/13). The further £22 million confirmed today is for 2013/14 (£12 million) and 2014/15 (£10 million). This funding was conditional upon the Trust producing an agreed Business Plan setting out an exit strategy for the Trust from 2015, after which the Trust will no longer receive funding from DCLG. The Trust's Business Plan for 2011 and beyond outlines how the Trust intends to transform itself into a self-sustaining organisation from 2015. Further details are available from the Trust (telephone - 01709 765 584).

2. The Skills Factory - an employability and personal development initiative - is an extension to the Trust's Family Employment Initiative and National Apprenticeship Programme. The Trust's investment in the Skills Factory is £210,345. Additional funding is being provided by Aylesham Neighbourhood Project, Aylesham and District Community Workshop Trust, and Dover, Deal and Sandwich Children's Centres.

3. The Skills Factory is delivered by Aylesham Neighbourhood Project, a charitable company which aims to enable people to achieve their potential, feel healthy and happy and be part of their local community. Based in Aylesham, the Skills Factory operates across the former East Kent coalfield areas. A key aspect of the initiative is to work in partnership with local skills and employment bodies.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1574989111,Council Tax revaluation,"Bob Neill responds to a Guardian editorial which claims that by ruling out a council tax revaluation, the Government is avoiding tough decisions.

You are wrong to suggest we have ducked tough decisions by ruling out a council tax revaluation (Editorial, 27 September). Our stance is consistent - both coalition parties opposed a council tax revaluation in opposition. Ruling out a Whitehall-driven revaluation protects the interests of the less well-off. If we hadn't, hard-working households would have faced bills up to £320 a year higher when they could least afford them. The 2005 Welsh revaluation proved revaluations hit poorer people harder. Two thirds of the increases were among the lowest banded homes. By contrast, the existing council tax system already revalues homes when they are sold if there has been a material improvement - such as a new extension. This prevents council tax being a home improvement tax, but ensures that larger homes pay more. Bills more than doubled under Labour, hitting fixed incomes hardest. This is why we're also working with councils to deliver a council tax freeze and have promised a long-term look at council resources. The public finances were left in a mess, and yes we have to sort them out, but more unfair council tax hikes are not the way to do that.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1993053,Countdown to British pubs week begins,"With British Pubs Week just over a month away, Community Pubs Minister Bob Neill met publicans and punters to celebrate all that is great about the 'British local' and to discuss how to make this year's pubs week the best yet.

At the countdown launch, at the award winning Black Dog in London, Mr Neill told patrons he was keen to see the role of the 'local' recognised not just as a place to grab a swift pint but as an important social and economic hub in communities across the country.

British Pubs week, which kicks off on 28 October, will see hundreds of pubs across the country inviting customers old and new to join them for a week of special events, special offers and special experiences all celebrating the role of the 'local' in the community.

Community Pubs Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Pubs are part of the fabric of local life - they are not just a place to meet friends over a pint but an important source of enterprise, business and community action. I think British Pubs Week can be another opportunity to recognise the unique contribution that pubs make to the communities they serve every week.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to seeing a pubs community hub role continue, which is why we are helping with business rates, reviewing restrictive red tape, stopping unfair supermarket sales of below cost-price by alcohol and giving communities the power to step in and preserve their favourite locals.""

### Government support to Community pubs

The Government has introduced a number of measures to support thriving community pubs:

  * Through the Community Right to Buy, the Department is giving residents the power to save struggling local pubs by taking them over rather than seeing them empty and derelict.

  * The Department for Communities and Local Government has launched a review of restrictive covenants, a clause that can be used in the sale of a building that restricts the use by new owners.

  * The Government has introduced a more generous small business rate relief scheme, to help half a million small firms. For two years from October 2010, small firms will receive 100 per cent rate relief (i.e. pay no business rates at all) on properties up to £6,000 Rateable Value, and a tapered rate relief from £6,000 to £12,000. An estimated 330,000 no small firms will pay no rates at all.

  * The Government is also giving local councils new powers via the Localism Bill to introduce local business rate discounts.

  * Plans have been announced for cutting the red tape that makes it difficult for pubs to provide live music.

  * The Government has also abolished the cider tax and is stopping unfair sales of alcohol below cost-price by supermarkets.

After a quick run down of bartending basics, from pulling pints to changing barrels from pub manager Tom Hayden, Mr Neill joined the staff rota for an afternoon shift at his local, The Partridge in Bromley.![Bob Neill at The Partridge pub](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2018510)

Coinciding with the start of British Pub week (Friday 28 October to Saturday 6 November), the shift was an excellent opportunity for the Minister to learn more about the day-to-day running of the local pub and show his support to the industry.

This year British Pub Week will see hundreds of pubs across the country inviting customers old and new to join them for a week of special events, special offers and special experiences all celebrating the role of the 'local' in the community.

Community Pubs Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Stepping behind the bar has been a great learning experience and not just in how to pull the perfect pint. Speaking to the landlord and locals here it is clear that pubs are so much more than places to grab a drink. They are hubs of community life as important to the local social scene as to the local economy.
> 
> ""Just as the pub is integral to the local community, so the local community is integral to the pub and we should all support our local. British Pub Week gives us another opportunity to celebrate this Great British institution, so let's drink to that.""

Tom Hayden, Manager of The Partridge said:

> ""The Partridge is a haven from the hustle and bustle of Bromley High Street, somewhere my regulars come to share their experiences of the day over a well-kept pint or two. At any point in time my pub can be a community centre, a village hall, a marriage guidance office or even an MP's drop-in surgery.
> 
> ""It's important that the community has somewhere they can leave their troubles behind and relax, and that's what we aim to provide at The Partridge.""

Across the country MPs are stepping behind the bars' of their local pub in a scheme organised by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group to highlight the important place of pubs in communities across the country.

The endowment fund will ensure that groups can develop their proposals at their own speed to improve their financial futures through buying and developing assets and providing a range of valuable services for their communities. These include setting up multi-purpose community facilities, mother and toddler groups, adult education classes and family support services. The programme will be signed over from government to be administered and managed by the Adventure Capital Fund from 1 April 2011.

> ""It is a time of change for the sector but with this comes new freedoms, such as less time spent assessing, analysing and reporting back to Whitehall and more time spent on drawing up flexible plans with community leaders on locally led-projects.""

Chair of the Adventure Capital Fund, Sir Stephen Bubb said:

> ""This endowment is great news for a struggling sector. It is a real endorsement of Adventure Capital Fund's pioneering model of social investment over the last decade.
> 
> ""I want to pay tribute in particular to the minister Greg Clark who recognised the value of making an endowment as a way of levering capital and gave it his crucial backing.
> 
> ""As a fund which will recycle loan repayments back into the sector, the endowment means we can support many more community organisations into the future.
> 
> ""So we can continue to provide loans to support people who want to take over the running of their local parks or libraries; to help community organisations who want to refurbish community centres to become financially sustainable; and to grow public service delivery by the third sector.""

The £70 million Communitybuilders Fund, previously owned by the Department of Communites and Local Government, is now an endowed fund - owned and administered by the Adventure Capital Fund. It supports neighbourhood-based, community-led organisations to become more sustainable through a mixture of loans, grants and business support. The fund is currently closed to new applications but the organisation expects it to reopen within a few months.

The purpose of the endowment is to allow the Communitybuilders Fund to become fully established for the foreseeable future and to ensure stable and continued management. It will allow for greater efficiency and financial planning, increasing value for money all round. It also creates an evergreen fund where loan repayments are recycled back into the sector, as well as the prospect of growing the fund by topping up the original amount with money from other investors, foundations or even philanthropists.

The Government is supporting local groups by letting them take centre stage in the running of local services and moving away from the dependency on grant funding from taxpayers.

At the heart of the Localism Bill is a suite of measures designed to strengthen the hand of groups wanting to take on a bigger role by entrenching powerful new rights for community groups.

There is also the opportunity for groups to get involved early as councils set their budgets. Ministers have said that it is reasonable to expect that they give voluntary and community groups three months' notice or more when they think they need to end or alter a grant, or other support. Rather than pulling up the drawbridge they should, as a matter of course, be open to suggestions from these groups on alternative ways of redesigning or reshaping the services so that they can continue to be provided even where budgets need to be reduced.

Ministers have urged more transparency about funding and that councils publish what they give in grants and payments to the voluntary and community sector.

The Adventure Capital Fund has been making investments in community enterprises since 2003 and offers a range of investment tools and support services to organisations looking to develop income streams that enable them to stand on their own two feet. For further information visit: [www.adventurecapitalfund.org.uk](http://www.adventurecapitalfund.org.uk/) (external link).

4. The remaining money from the Communitybuilders Fund (£27 million) has been used to create this endowment and can be spent after the 1 April 2011.

It will allow for greater efficiency and financial planning, increasing value for money.

5. Up until 1 April 2011 the Adventure Capital Fund managed the Communitybuilders Fund in partnership with The Social Investment Business and Community Alliance (made up of bassac, Community Matters and the Development Trusts Association) on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Office for Civil Society.

6. After 1 April 2011, the Communitybuilders Fund will no longer be managed on behalf  of Department for Communities and Local Government and Office for Civil Society by Adventure Capital Fund. The Fund will now be owned and administered Adventure Capital Fund, and will continue to run to provide the same support as it does now. This will lead to more projects to help the transfer of assets to communities, support to develop enterprise activities that help them become sustainable, and resources for new community centres and spaces well into the future. Adventure Capital Fund will ensure transparency for Communitybuilders Fund by publishing details of the organisations it has helped and the way in which they were helped on the internet, to be updated at least quarterly.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1958253,Boost to community pubs with launch of review into restrictive covenants,"As part of the Government's commitment to the Great British pub, Community Pubs Minister Bob Neill today launched a review of restrictive covenants, a legal clause that can be used to prevent community pubs reopening as public houses following a sale.

Between 2004 and 2009 some 572 pubs are said to have been permanently lost following a sale with a restrictive covenant, potentially depriving thousands of regulars of an important community asset.

A covenant can have a double whammy effect, not only taking away a vital community hub but also preventing local people from being able to step in and revive their 'local' as a community run asset. By changing the use of certain restrictive covenants, communities would be given greater opportunities to use the new 'Community Right to Buy' power in the Localism Bill, which gives local communities the chance to take over and run much-loved local assets, such as the 'local', when they come up for sale.

Speaking at the start of the Great British Beer Festival, Bob Neill said:

> ""Pubs are hubs of community life, as important to the local social scene as they are to the local economy. Throughout their rich and diverse history they have proved themselves to be resilient, enterprising and full of initiative. But time is being called at too many of our 'locals', depriving people of treasured places to get together in the community.
> 
> ""We are putting the people back in charge, giving them the power to step in and save their much loved community assets. Communities across the country are already stepping in to save their pub from closure. By reviewing this restrictive red tape we are giving people another opportunity to use their collective powers to ensure that their locals remain local and continue to thrive at the heart of the community.""

One community already stepping in to save their treasured local is Hudswell village in North Yorkshire. When their local pub 'The George and Dragon' closed three years ago and looked likely to remain empty, local residents got together to take action. Forming a cooperative, members sought local investment, and about 100 members of the community put up funds that enabled them to buy the pub. The George and Dragon's garden is now the site for community allotments, the pub includes space for a small shop, a library as well as offering internet access and laptops available to rent.

### A welcome move

Groups such as the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) have said that covenants can be used by larger companies to limit competition and close local pubs, and are supportive of the Government's move to consult on the clause.

Mike Benner, CAMRA Chief Executive said:

> ""CAMRA wholeheartedly welcomes this announcement of a Government consultation on the use of restrictive covenants - it's a great success for localism, and shows that Government recognises that pubs are vital community assets that need to be protected. For the new community right to buy scheme being introduced as part of the Localism Bill to work, pubs need to be available for communities to keep open.
> 
> ""It's a victory too for people power: this proposal came from communities on the ground, via their local councils who put the proposals to central Government.""

To further support thriving community pubs the Government has introduced a more generous small business rate relief scheme, to help half a million small firms. For two years from October 2010, small firms will receive 100 per cent rate relief (i.e. pay no business rates at all) on properties up to £6,000 Rateable Value, and a tapered rate relief from £6,000 to £12,000. An estimated 330,000 small firms will pay no rates at all.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation will run for 12 weeks from 2 August 2011 to 5pm on 25 October 2011. The consultation paper, complete with electronic response form, is available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/pubrestrictivecovenants](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/pubrestrictivecovenants).

2. Restrictive covenants are placed on land or property to control their use. A restrictive covenant may be defined as, a promise by one person with another, for example, by a buyer of land with a seller, not to do certain things with the land. They may often take the form of a contractual arrangement, such as clause in a deed or lease, which limits what the new owner can do with the property and land. Restrictive covenants also have the power to 'run with the land' meaning that it (and the restrictions it imposes) will still be in effect for subsequent buyers of the property or land.

3. Three local councils (Darlington, Newcastle upon Tyne and Ryedale) have applied under the Sustainable Communities Act for the Government to take action on the issue of restrictive covenants. As a result, the government agreed to a public consultation on the issue as a means of understanding the local level impact of covenants on communities. Further information about the Sustainable Communities Act can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/scadecisions](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/scadecisions).

4. The Community Right to Buy measures are included in the Localism Bill. The Community Right to Buy will require local authorities to maintain a list of sites of community value put forward for consideration by communities. The local authority will assess the suggestions before recording on the list. When listed land comes up for disposal (either the freehold or a long leasehold), communities will be given the chance to develop a bid and raise the capital to buy the asset. They will then be in a better position to bid to buy the asset when it comes on the market at the end of the moratorium. Further information about the Community Right to Buy can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/localismbill/communityrights/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1958253).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1974306,Bowling greens to be given special protections under new planning rules,"Bowling enthusiasts will be able to use new powers to safeguard treasured bowling greens from the threat of development or closure, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said today.

Under new planning rules being proposed by the Government, communities will be able to classify green spaces such as bowling greens for special protections. New community rights will give local people a bigger say over what happens in their area and taken together these new powers could be used to ensure that pitches are preserved for the enjoyment of future generations.

The National Planning Policy Framework, published for consultation recently, includes a new local green spaces designation. The framework makes provision for green spaces to be identified by communities for special treatment within new neighbourhood plans. The designation could cover bowling greens as well as other recreational areas, wildlife havens or beauty spots. The plans are subject to a community vote and once agreed would go on to form part of the local planning policy.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Bowling is one of the nation's most popular pastimes and the bowling green has long been part of the fabric of our towns and villages. The new powers we are proposing can help to preserve this part of England's sporting and cultural heritage for years to come.
> 
> ""The local pitch, pavilion, park or playing field are at the heart of community life, where people come together to play sport and socialise. Making sure people can go on enjoying their local amenities is at the heart of the changes being made to the planning system. We are putting power in the hands of communities and increasing protections for those spaces that are important to them.""

The changes outlined in the National Planning Policy framework to give local people greater control over much loved green spaces signals the strong emphasis the Government has placed on protection of the environment and local communities' interests in drawing up new planning rules.

The new protections are further reinforced by a new Community Right to Buy which gives local groups the opportunity to bid for bowling greens if they are facing the threat of being sold off. The new right, which is included in the Localism Bill currently making its way through Parliament, will enshrine in law measures to 'stop the clock' on any proposed sale, giving local bowlers the time they need to raise money. In addition, a new Community Right to Challenge will mean that local bowling clubs can bid to take over the running and management of a council-owned bowling green, placing the future of their resource more firmly in their own hands.

Mr Pickles added:

> ""I know that bowlers, as well as other community groups, have been frustrated by a sense of powerlessness to stop treasured assets and amenities disappearing. The rights we are putting into law will make sure that local people no longer have to stand by as decisions are made beyond their control. They will be on a much surer footing when it comes getting heard and getting the time and 'in' they need to determine what happens in their area.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1881525,British Chambers of Commerce to lead local enterprise partnership network,"The British Chambers of Commerce, working with local business people all around the country, will bring together a new, national network for local enterprise partnerships, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The new network will help ensure that businesses are the heart and soul of local enterprise partnerships. It will provide a forum for local business leaders to share ideas, solve problems and get the latest data they need to promote economic growth across the country.

The Government wants local areas to take control of their economic future. Local enterprise partnerships are locally-owned partnerships between business and civic leaders that decide local economic priorities and drive forward growth and job creation in their local communities, helping to rebalance the national economy.

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, has agreed to chair the new network. It will bring together a diverse range of local businesses, and will be inclusive of other business organisations, to tackle the big issues around local growth. The network will aim to encourage broad participation and private sector support within local enterprise partnerships in the months and years to come.

Mr Pickles also confirmed that Government will make some grant funding available to support the network during its start-up phase.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Government believes private sector led growth is the way ahead for the country and a business-led network for local enterprise partnerships can help deliver local growth that rebalances the national economy.
> 
> ""This will avoid unnecessary interference from Whitehall and repeating the bureaucratic legacy of Regional Development Agencies, but also means local enterprise partnerships can get off to a strong start.
> 
> ""British Chambers of Commerce came forward with a very strong proposal and with its existing business network across the country it is really well placed to anchor business at the centre of new local enterprise.""

Local enterprise partnerships have welcomed the new network today.

Andy Wood, chief executive of Adnams Plc and joint chairman of the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, said:

> ""I welcome the Government's decision to support a local enterprise partnership network through the British Chambers of Commerce. It is important that areas work together to tackle common issues and share their experiences as we strive to create more private sector jobs and deliver sustainable economic growth.""

George Beveridge, the Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership Interim Chair:

> ""This new network is great news and should provide real support to local enterprise partnerships across the country. I'm delighted that Chambers will be playing such a central role, ensuring that this initiative is truly led by business. Our local Chamber and other partners have played a key role in bringing our local enterprise partnership into being and continue to be immensely supportive. This augurs well for this new association.""

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said:

> ""Business leaders across England have given their time and their energy to developing new local enterprise partnerships. This new network will give them the opportunity to share their experiences, solve some of the problems that come with new ways of working, and develop an even stronger understanding of how to grow their local economies.
> 
> ""Our priority now is to listen to local business leaders - this is their network. It will only succeed if it delivers a supportive forum to exchange ideas, a way to engage with Ministers, and the data and information that partnerships need to support local growth.
> 
> ""The British Chambers of Commerce is delighted to be at the heart of this network, and will work tirelessly to ensure that it helps enable enterprise growth across England.""

Business Minister Mark Prisk said:

> ""We are now close to full coverage of local enterprise partnerships across England, and it is important they have a forum independent of government where they can share knowledge and ideas, and develop their role in driving growth.
> 
> ""Businesses and local authorities have put a lot of hard work into setting up the partnerships. They will benefit hugely, not only from the grant funding which is being made available, but from working with the British Chambers of Commerce, who will help them access the guidance and contacts which will see partnerships thrive in their local communities.""

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark added:

> ""Local enterprise partnerships now cover 91 per cent of businesses and 21 million employees across the country. Local chambers are already heavily involved in working with these new partnerships. I'm delighted the British Chambers of Commerce will now be bringing together a new national network to give local business leaders across the country a forum to share ideas and solve problems as these partnerships get off the ground.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1736409,Buckinghamshire flag to fly at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Buckinghamshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended earlier this month by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""English counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

David Shakespeare, Leader of Buckinghamshire County Council, said:

> ""Counties are the natural regions of the country. As a county Buckinghamshire has been around since the 10th century when our Saxon ancestors created shires, and certainly so-named since the 12th century. There's a deep sense of pride and shared identity within the communities that make up Buckinghamshire, and I'm delighted the importance of our county is being recognised in this way.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2112156,Budget 2012,"An additional £420m to stimulate local economic growth was announced by the Chancellor in his Budget. There will be additional funds for:

  * **Getting Britain Building** - Confirmed an additional investment of £150m to unlock 'shovel ready' housing sites with planning permission creating up to 16,000 new homes and over 30,000 jobs. Last week Grant Shapps announced the projects shortlisted for this extra funding.
  * **Growing Places Fund** - An additional £270m will be given to local enterprise partnerships to deliver the key infrastructure needed to promote economic growth, create jobs and build new houses. This is on top of £500m already allocated.

Other measures include:

  * **Right To Buy** - A reinvigorated scheme so two million council tenants have the opportunity to get on the property ladder with a new national discount cap of £75,000 from April. Local authorities will be allowed to retain a proportion of the receipt to cover debt on the homes sold.  Additional homes sold will be replaced on a one-for-one basis with new affordable homes to rent.
  * **Tax Increment Financing** - Up to £150m will be available from 2013/14 for large scale infrastructure projects in core cities. Financed through Tax Increment Financing Type 2 schemes that let local authorities borrow against future growth in business rates for 25 years.
  * **City Deals** - A Manchester city deal will focus on an innovative 'Earnback' scheme. Deals with the remaining core cities of Bristol, Birmingham, Newcastle, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham and the wider Liverpool economic area will be announced in due course.
  * **Housing Revenue Account reform** - Confirmed plans to implement a devolved system for financing council housing from April. This will give all 168 council landlords a long term, stable source of funding to meet the needs of their tenants and local area. It will mean on average 15 per cent more money to spend on council housing.
  * **Real Estate Investment Trusts** - A consultation will look at the role these property investment vehicles could play in supporting the social housing sector. The Government is keen to see increased private investment in affordable housing, to help deliver much needed new supply, whilst ensuring protection for existing social housing tenants and the taxpayer.
  * **Land Auctions -** The Government is taking forward land auction pilot on public sector land with the aim of having two sites ready for market by the end of the year.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1973349,Building greener homes costing less each year,"Building new homes to greener, low-carbon standards is getting cheaper every year, according to a [new report](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeupdatedcostreview) published today by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.

The new research, based on interviews with developers and the latest information about environmental technologies, shows the overall extra costs of building new homes to standards set in the Code for Sustainable Homes is falling year on year.

For homes built to Code level 3 standards, average extra costs have fallen by almost three quarters in the last three years - falling from £4,458 in 2008 to £1,128 in 2010.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Building greener homes is vital if we are to meet our nation's commitment to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change - so today's report is good news for the entire country. The progress that has been made does not only benefit developers building Code-standard homes, it also provides valuable lessons ahead of the transition to building new homes to zero carbon standards from 2016.
> 
> ""As a country we still have lot of work to do to reduce carbon emissions from new development, but what these figures show us is that as the construction industry continues to build more sustainable homes, there is further potential for the costs associated building greener homes to continue falling"".

### Notes to editors

1. The Code for Sustainable Homes is the national standard for the sustainable design and construction of new homes. The Code aims to reduce our carbon emissions and create homes that are more sustainable.

2. Beginning in 2007, the Code is used to measure the sustainability of new homes against nine design categories, each offering a range of 'credits' for meeting sustainability criteria. The more 'credits' secured the higher the Code star rating awarded to a development, up to Code level 6.Developers can chose which technologies and approaches they wish to use to minimise their costs and maximise their credits.

3. Every year since the Code started in 2007, a short piece of research has been conducted to establish approximately how much different Code standards and components cost, and what the trends are amongst developers in securing Code credits.  This latest report will be the third in the series, and was commissioned last year as part of the impact assessment underpinning the 2010 revision of the Code.

4. The work is based on primary research and interviews with both private and public housing developers, as well as modelling of cost trends across a wide range of environmental building technologies and services.

From now on, instead of organisers being met with endless, confusing guidelines on food licences, road closures and insurance - councils can ask street party organisers to complete one simple form.

A cross government meeting held by Mr Pickles, with the Department for Transport, Department for Culture, Media and Sport as well as local government and community groups such as the Big Lunch and Streets Alive, has agreed this new approach.

Mr Pickles will make it clear in a new leaflet that there are no dusty, central laws restricting councils from taking a common sense approach to administrating events.

He will expel the myth that councils are required by law to advertise and charge extortionate fees for small road closures, potentially saving organisers thousands of pounds.

Previously, some small community groups were asked to apply for up to five separate licences and found it tricky to get upfront advice on what to do. They also found out about hidden costs right at the last minute, causing delays or cancellations to community events.

Communities Secretary Mr Pickles, said:

> ""Fetes, street parties and fairs should be fun, and everyone's energy needs to go into the fun part - not trawling through endless reams of guidance and dusty rules.
> 
> ""I want to banish the myths around laws preventing people from putting on events.
> 
> ""So there is still time for you to get together with your neighbours this summer. Your council may be able to help you close a road for a proper street party. If not, you can hold something in a garden or even the park. It's your community, so celebrate it.""

For most small organised street parties that don't affect the wider road network, there is no requirement in law for local authorities to advertise proposed closures or carry out consultations. Neither are specific signs or other traffic management equipment required.  Local authorities should act proportionately, wisely, and in the public interest - and highways law do not present any barriers to that.

Some easy, good practice guidance has been agreed in a new leaflet which will be published in September and be made available online and from town halls.

Chris Gittins, Director of street party campaign group, Streets Alive:

> ""At last the red tape is being cut on road closures and the bunting can go up on building community spirit through street parties. After years of campaigning on this the Government is listening to us. Though there is more to do, it is a great step for common sense and a chance to open up the country to the simple pleasure of meeting your neighbours in your traffic-free street. We hope that councils will respond with a sigh of relief and make it easier for residents to join in what is a great British tradition.""

Edward Lister, Leader of Wandsworth Council:

> ""Traditional street parties are a terrific way for neighbours to have fun and get to know each other better. This year we made some big changes which made it much easier for our residents to get these up and running. We've been advising the new Government on ways in which they can cut through the red tape and come up with a streamlined, user-friendly application process with local authority interference kept to an absolute minimum. If we want street parties to take off then councils need to stop fussing over the paperwork and leave the organisers free to get on with it.""

A Croydon Council spokesman said:

> ""Our overall aim is to help communities organise on-street activities wherever it is safe and practical to do so. We would expect that reducing red tape to simplify the process would be appreciated within communities who want to bring people together in a social environment. If it makes it easier to organise street parties, fetes and so on then this is something we would welcome as these kind of events are potentially powerful in developing a community ethos among people of all ages and backgrounds.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1905092,Business and communities to unite in driving neighbourhood growth,"The first businesses to work hand in hand with their communities to trial proposed new neighbourhood planning powers to help boost local economies were announced by Planning Minister Greg Clark today.

Eight business groups are being given the opportunity to test out the approach being proposed in the Localism Bill to develop a business led Neighbourhood Plan for local business areas and town centres that benefits the whole community.

The Business Neighbourhood Frontrunners will work with local councils and community groups to prepare the planning and development framework to bring the right kind of development to their area. If these are later passed in a local referendum they will be adopted by the council.

The business groups will act as frontrunners spearheading neighbourhood plans that make it easier to change the designated use of buildings and expand facilities to meet changing needs and remove the need to apply to the council for every adaptation made to a building.

The ambitions of local people and their local firms and shops are often one and the same and much needed growth can be achieved quicker by using the expertise and resources of local business people to spearhead the right development swiftly. The plans will also help with the regeneration of local high streets - making them better places to visit and shop.

The announcement comes as the Localism Bill moves to Report Stage today and follows new amendments that were introduced to strengthen the promotion of growth following the Planning for Growth Budget.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Local businesses are vital to stimulating growth and benefit their communities way beyond just providing jobs. They can revive neglected neighbourhoods, support schools or make a significant contribution to community facilities.
> 
> ""We need to involve local companies more explicitly in neighbourhood planning decisions for business areas if communities are to get the most out of them. Businesses have access to skills, resources and expertise that can give a real boost to getting the right kind of growth underway in many areas. Business Neighbourhood Frontrunners are about residents and businesses shaping their neighbourhood together.
> 
> ""Ensuring all members of a community are involved in driving development in their neighbourhood is central to our planning reforms and local businesses are an equally important part of many communities.""

The areas that have expressed an interest in being Business Neighbourhood Frontrunners, typically business and industrial parks and retail neighbourhoods, are: Aldershot Town Centre; Bankside, London; Central Milton Keynes; Liverpool Innovation Park; Team Valley Trading Estate, Gateshead; Trafford Park, Manchester; South Bank, London, New West End Company, London.

#### Liverpool Innovation Park - owned by Space NW:

The regeneration of this brown field site is being hampered by the need to apply to the council for every aspect of development and change of commercial use. Space NW intends spearheading a plan to develop an education campus, create amenities to attract businesses that will also benefit local people and respond more quickly to opportunities to grow and expand existing facilities.

#### Central Milton Keynes:

This area is the town's main location for retail, office and leisure development. The council is eager to create a plan to determine which development needs permission, and to make it easier for community groups and young businesses to locate to new premises without the need for planning applications.

The Frontrunners are now being invited through their local planning authority to make a formal application to the Department to access support and funding to help cover expenses from developing a plan. We are now inviting other business organisations to work with their council and apply to be a business frontrunner.

Liz Peace, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said:

> ""We are delighted to have worked closely with Government on this key initiative which heralds a new approach to local planning, enabling businesses as well as residents to take the lead in shaping their neighbourhoods in partnership with local planning authorities.
> 
> ""The business neighbourhood frontrunners unveiled today are all areas with an enormous potential for economic growth. Designation as a business neighbourhood should help them to put together a planning and development framework for their areas that allows them to realise that potential. We hope that many other business neighbourhoods will follow their lead.""

The Business Frontrunners scheme is part of a package of measures and amendments made to the Localism Bill to make the planning process less regulatory and more firmly focused on supporting rebalancing economic growth.

Other amendments include a strengthened duty to cooperate. This requirement for councils to work together on planning issues has been amended to ensure councils have regard to work and views of local enterprise partnerships when preparing their local plan. It also requires them to work across council boundaries to consider joint approaches and joint local plans.

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said:

> ""Businesses are a key part of our local communities, and it is right that they are able to play an active role in neighbourhood forums. Giving business owners a voice in neighbourhood planning will allow them to help set the agenda for business growth, rather than being impeded by an overly bureaucratic system. The British Chambers of Commerce has long campaigned for a more pro-business approach to planning, and we are pleased to see that the Government has listened to the business community on this important issue.
> 
> ""Getting the planning system right is crucial if we are to continue to see a private sector-led recovery, and these changes are an encouraging step in the right direction.""

### Notes to editors

Other Business Neighbourhood Frontrunners include:

#### Team Valley Trading Estate, Gateshead - owned by North East Property Partnership

This industrial estate is occupied by offices, industrial, retail and leisure companies but is restricted by the current planning system from meeting its customers' property needs. This has resulted in businesses either moving out of the neighbourhood or compromising their own growth. The Partnership would develop a plan that would allow the estate to develop to the pace that property is required, enabling them to deliver space faster and cheaper.

#### Southbank, London - plan spearheaded by South Bank Employers' Group

This complex area is home to 12,000 residents and 50,000 employees and includes a major transport hub, business headquarters, world renowned visitor attractions, universities and a hospital. Businesses and the community want to develop a plan that includes improvements to public areas better retail opportunities for new and existing customers.

#### New West End Company, London

The West End is one of the world's top shopping destinations and receives 200 million visitors a year and employs 100,000. It is also home to 36,000 people. The company wants to work with the local community and council to shape local planning policy so it works for the whole community. Their plan would look at design, site access, local amenities and public space and streetscape.

#### Bankside, London

This area of Southwark on the south side of the River Thames is home to 6,000 residents and 60,000 employees. Better Bankside represents local businesses and will work with the council and Bankside Residents' Forum to develop a plan to provide more affordable business and shop space, improve public amenities, and create more community facilities for both residents and workers, such as dentists, creches and doctors surgeries.

#### Trafford Park, Manchester

Trafford Park is one of the largest industrial parks in Europe and home to 1,300 businesses employing 32,000 people. The Park wants to spearhead a plan with the community to overcome planning shortcoming that are a block to attracting external finance. The plan would improve co-operation between businesses and forge stronger links with the council.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1650030,Business backs local enterprise partnerships,"This week the Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles met with the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Federation of Small Business (FSB) to discuss the importance of business leadership and vision for local enterprise partnerships, which are intended to drive local economic growth across England.

The Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""We want to urgently rebuild and rebalance local economies without strangling businesses with red tape so that new economic opportunities spread across the country.
> 
> ""I was delighted to meet with and hear the views of the Federation for Small Business and British Chamber of Commerce - they have a central role to play, working hand in hand with local leaders, to develop and deliver new local enterprise partnerships that will make the economy responsive to the needs of local business and local people.""

Small businesses and local chambers of commerce as key business partners will have a key role helping to develop and deliver local enterprise partnerships with local councils.

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said:

> ""The future of our local economies - from Cornwall to Carlisle - hinges on the growth of the wealth-generating private sector. The Secretary of State and I are in complete agreement on this point.
> 
> ""We also agree that Chambers of Commerce, the beating hearts of England's local business communities, must play a crucial leadership role in delivering that growth. As local enterprise partnerships develop across the country, Chambers will work together with local councils to set a clear vision for growth, prosperity, and jobs - and will help deliver the innovative, private-sector leadership that local enterprise partnerships will need to succeed.""

Mike Cherry, Policy Chairman, Federation of Small Businesses, said:

> ""Small businesses must not be ignored and it is crucial that their voice is heard in the newly established local enterprise partnerships, so it is fantastic news that the FSB is going to be the key business partner. While we welcome the creation of these new bodies, we all know that the 4.8 million small firms are the engine room of the economy and the key to creating jobs and so must play a vital role in these new groupings.
> 
> ""It is crucial, during this time of economic uncertainty, that the influence of the small business community continues to be felt at local and regional level. We are working closely with the Coalition Government on putting local enterprise partnerships in place and we want to ensure that the new entities will deliver results so that small firms have the ability to grow and develop, and ultimately boost local economies.""

The Government is committed to replacing the Regional Development Agencies with local enterprise partnerships of elected authorities and businesses who can provide the strategic leadership and economic vision for their local area. To be effective, it is crucial that business works in equal partnership with civic leaders to drive real change in public service delivery and create a better business environment.

### Lord Heseltine to lead Regional Growth Fund Panel

The Government also announced today that Lord Heseltine will chair the Independent Approval Panel for the £1bn Regional Growth Fund. The new Panel will consider proposals for funding and recommend to Ministers which projects should be taken forward.

Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""Lord Heseltine is the perfect choice for Chair: his regeneration pedigree will be vital when identifying the projects that deserve Regional Growth Fund support.
> 
> ""Local enterprise partnerships will be central to that by returning democratic accountability they will show how local businesses, local councils and communities - freed from bureaucratic hurdles - can work together to reopen and rebalance Britain's economy.""

The Regional Growth Fund has been set up to provide support for projects that offer significant potential for sustainable economic growth and can create new private sector employment. It will particularly help areas and communities currently highly-reliant on public sector employment make the transition to growth and prosperity. In a consultation published today, the Government is seeking views on how the fund should be designed to best meet the needs of areas and communities across England. Launching the consultation, the Deputy Prime Minister said:

> ""The Regional Growth Fund is an innovative new mechanism to unleash the talent and drive that will help get the country back on its feet.""

Local enterprise partnerships will play an important role in bringing together bids for the Regional Growth Fund, working with key partners such as universities. Private sector companies and other public-private partnerships will also be invited to bid independently for the fund.

Lord Heseltine said:

> ""I am delighted to have been asked to help with this exciting project. It builds on the experiences I've had in helping people in deprived areas to help themselves and their communities achieve aspirations that, without schemes of this sort, might be impossible.
> 
> ""This is about local people, local initiatives and local success in areas where the inevitable cuts will be most heavily felt.""

Business Secretary, Vince Cable added:

> ""I'm delighted that Lord Heseltine and Sir Ian Wrigglesworth have agreed to lead the Approval Panel for this important initiative.
> 
> ""The Regional Growth Fund demonstrates that England is open for business. It will support enterprise and incentivise the growth of local economies; mobilizing private sector investment across the country and creating sustainable private sector jobs. And Michael and Ian's experience and strategic oversight will help ensure it is a success.""

**Transparency timeline** [ ![Local government transparency timeline](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1730360)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1729989) Use the [timeline](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1729989) to find out if your council has published their data

In an online clip (see below) the minister laid out why council transparency was so important and commended the councils who have already taken the plunge.

A map and timeline laying out when and where councils have published their £500 spend was also launched today to illustrate what areas are lagging behind. 

### Deadline approaching

So far less than seventy councils have been brave enough to face public scrutiny and with just 64 working days until the start of the New Year the clock is ticking for councils to open their files so the public can see where their money is being spent.

Mr Pickles added:

> ""I've called for a new era of transparency where all councils publish their spending over £500 online. I commend those councils that have been brave enough to face public scrutiny so far. There are now only sixty or so working days for those lagging behind to catch up.
> 
> ""The public have a right to see how their council tax is being spent so they know they are getting value for money and the best possible frontline services.
> 
> ""I want to see an army of 'Armchair Auditors' pore over the information and hold their council to account if things are not done right. That means the data also has to be easily accessible: today advice has been published that will help councils yet to comply. There are hundreds of computer whizzes who'll find creative new ways to make that raw data relevant to local life.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1857075,Calls for council to support the People's Supermarket,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill has today written to Camden Council's leader urging him to reconsider the decision to not grant the People's Supermarket, a social enterprise initiative, a not-for-profit business rate discount.

The People's Supermarket is a sustainable food cooperative working within a local area providing healthy, local food at reasonable prices. The supermarket caught the nation's attention in a Channel 4 documentary and was praised by the Prime Minister as a shining example of the Big Society when he visited it.

It has come to light that Camden Council has decided not to grant the People's Supermarket non-profit rate relief and that it served the premises with a court order for non-payment of a £33,500 rates bill, on top of £6000 already paid off, before taking a decision on its discretionary relief application.

Councils have a discretionary power to grant business rate relief of up to one hundred per cent for properties occupied by not for profit organisations. The decision to award this kind of relief is legally one only the council can make. When such a decision is made government meets 75 per cent of the cost.

Bob Neill said:

> ""The People's Supermarket is great example of a sustainable food co-operative providing healthy local food at reasonable prices and is an inspiration to other co-operatives around the country.
> 
> ""I have written to Camden Council to ask it to reconsider its decision not to grant the non-profit rate relief. There is a clear public benefit from the People's Supermarket to the local community and a broader public interest in promoting co-operatives and the Big Society.
> 
> ""I am concerned that Camden's actions could undermine this important Big Society initiative.""

### Notes to editors

1. Section 47 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 provides a discretionary power for local authorities to grant rate relief, of up to 100 per cent, in respect of a non-domestic property occupied by certain bodies not established or conducted for profit. Where such discretionary rate relief is granted, central government automatically picks up 75 per cent of the cost and the remaining 25 per cent is borne by the local authority.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1588186,Cameron and Clegg launch the Big Society,"Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced their plans for a new era of people power at the centre of the new Government today. Their plans will empower communities, roll back big government, bureaucracy and Whitehall power. The Prime Minister promised that the idea of the Big Society would be marching through the corridors of power, starting a deep and serious reform agenda to take power away from politicians and give it to people.

Speaking on the Daily Politics Show CLG Minister of State Greg Clark said:

> ""There is a very exciting new approach here. For too long now, government has been something done to people. There is the chance of re-thinking politics to get people in the heart of government, to help them to do things in their own community. I think it's important that government is run by people rather than imposed on people.""

### A Greater Say for Communities

The policies announced today include;

  * Giving communities a greater say over their local planning system and saving local services, such as post offices and pubs.

  * Piloting a new National Citizen Service which will give 16 year olds the chance to develop the skills needed to be active and responsible citizens, mix with people from different backgrounds, and start getting involved in their communities.

  * Extending powers for local government by giving a general power of competence to local councils, enabling them to act as they see fit in the best interests of their communities, as well as conducting a comprehensive review of local government finance in order to help remove restrictions that limit the work of local councils.

  * Supporting mutuals, co-operatives, charities and social enterprises, giving them greater involvement in the running of public services. Funds from dormant bank accounts will be used to establish a Big Society Bank, providing new funds for neighbourhood groups, charities, social enterprises and other non-governmental bodies.

Please see the Cabinet Office Press Notice and the agreed policies for building the Big Society for more information (see top right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1839173,'Can do' councils come to fore,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles praises 'can do' councils who are acting to protect frontline services and local council tax payers.

The nation faces an unprecedented financial situation and every part of the public sector, including local government, which accounts for a quarter of all public expenditure, has a part to play in cutting the deficit.

Over one hundred and thirty councils have already indicated that they will be taking up the Government offer to fund a council tax freeze in April through its £650 million fund (see related downloads below). Authorities who do not increase their council tax are eligible for a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax.

Hammersmith and Fulham Council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster City Council have today reached a landmark agreement to combine back office and management that will save £35 million a year by 2014/15 protecting the frontline services and electoral sovereignty.

![embed: ](http://www.youtube.com/v/Gnn3fpBzdl4?fs=1&hl=en_GB)

_A transcript of the video is available below._

One council signed up to the council tax freeze initiative is West Norfolk who are also freezing car parking charges and councillor allowances, keeping bin collections weekly through a new shared service agreement with North Norfolk District Council and due to start in 2013 that will save £400,000.

Ryedale District Council, which is also freezing council tax, is only facing a single cut to its service next year - scrapping their taxpayer funded newsletter.

Kettering Borough another 'can do' council, has created a one-stop shop so residents have easier access to 18 of its vital public services all conveniently placed under one roof - reducing its building overheads.

Reading Borough Council has increased what it gives to voluntary and community groups by an extra £220,000 taking its total funding to over £7 million because of the huge contribution they make to the town's success.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I welcome the news that already over 130 'can do' councils are planning to take part in the Government's £650 million council tax freeze initiative.
> 
> ""And it is great to see three big London councils lead the way sharing senior staff and back offices, saving taxpayers millions of pounds and showing its possible to do more for less and protect frontline services in the process.
> 
> ""This shows that local authorities can keep taxes down and protect frontline services. Driving down the nation's deficit is the Governments biggest priority but we have made sure that extra money is available to protect the public from council tax rises offering real help to hard working families and pensioners.
> 
> ""The new localism powers and spending freedoms we are handing councils will help them be as efficient and effective as possible.""

A fair and progressive funding settlement for councils that protect front-line services and shields the most vulnerable communities with significant social challenges was confirmed last week. For example, residents in Hackney will receive £1043 per head and those in Wokingham will receive £125 per head.

£29.4 billion of council grant has been fairly distributed between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. As a result councils will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall.

Local authorities have already been given full control over £7 billion of funding, all non-schools ring fenced grants have been removed, councils and the NHS are being brought closer together and the bureaucratic burdens associated with inspection and targets have been removed.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2028888,Candle fire safety week: snuff out the fire risk,"Fire and Rescue Services across the country are asking people to take care this Candle Fire Safety Week and snuff out the risk of fire in their homes.

With the days growing darker and winter setting in, a few candles scattered round the room can lend a warm glow to an evening in or add some festive cheer to the season's celebrations such as Guy Fawkes' night, Eid and Christmas.

But with over fifty fires started by candles every day, the Fire Kills Campaign is asking people to take extra care with candles this winter.

In 2010, Reckitt Benckiser, manufacturers of Air Wick candles, reported that 70 per cent of annual candle sales were made between September and February. So it's no coincidence that between October and February every year candle-related house fires rise sharply, peaking at more than double the summer average in December.

The most important steps you can take to keep yourself and your loved ones safe include making sure your candles are kept away from flammable materials like curtains and putting out candles when nobody is in the room.

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Candles are increasingly used in many homes. But it's important to remember that a candle is not just another decoration. Left unattended, the naked flame could result in a devastating fire.
> 
> ""Over fifty fires are started by candles every day - make sure you don't become a statistic. Place your lit candles carefully, away from curtains, pets and children and always remember to put them out when you leave the room, even for a moment.""
> 
> ""Even with these precautions it's crucial to be prepared should the worst happen. A working smoke alarm can give you the vital time you need to get out, stay out and call 999. Keep yourself and your loved ones safe by testing your alarm regularly and practising your escape routes.""

To help you enjoy your candles safely this Candle Fire Safety Week, Fire Kills is offering some top tips:

  * **Never leave burning candles unattended.** Put burning candles out when you leave the room, and make sure they're out completely at night.
  * **Place your candles carefully.** Make sure they are on a stable surface, out of the reach of pets and children, and keep them away from flammable objects like curtains, furniture, bedding and books.
  * **Don't move candles once they are lit.**
  * **Do not burn several candles close together** as this might cause the flame to flare.
  * **Burn candles in a well-ventilated room,** out of draughts, vents or air currents. This will help prevent rapid or uneven burning, soot, and dripping.
  * **Always put scented candles in a heat resistant holder.** These candles are designed to liquefy when heated to maximise fragrance.
  * **Fit a smoke alarm and test it regularly.** A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999.
  * Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do if a fire should occur - **practise your escape route.**

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1847393,Capital growth targeted as London signs up to local enterprise network,"A new local enterprise partnership to lead local growth for London's firms was today given the green light by Decentralisation Minister, Greg Clark and Minister for Business, Mark Prisk.

The London Mayor and a leading business person will co-chair the city's new local enterprise Board, which will bring together the capital's political and business leaders, local boroughs and universities with the aim of making London the world capital of business.

There are now 31 local enterprise partnerships across the country since the Government's Local Growth White Paper was published in October last year. Local enterprise partnerships now cover over 87 per cent of the population, 1.8 million businesses and 20 million employees.

Ministers believe this announcement is a strong testament to the ambition and enthusiasm that local enterprise partnerships are inspiring across the country to revitalise the economy and create growth from the ground up.

The London proposal, which will help to ensure the Mayor's aim for London to have the most competitive business environment in the world, has the support of London Councils (representing the support of all London boroughs), London First, the London Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses.

Greg Clark said:

> ""I'm delighted to be able to invite London to begin appointing its local enterprise partnership board today. This partnership has the ambition, big ideas and clout needed to create economic growth in the capital from the ground up. We are continuing to put London's future firmly in the hands of Londoners.
> 
> ""Nearly 90 per cent of the population now has a local enterprise partnership set to promote jobs and prosperity in their local area. This is a testament to the ideas, ambition and innovation you can find at the grassroots.
> 
> ""Local councils, local business and civic leaders who know their area best are coming together to take the reins of their local economy and ensure its future success.""

Mark Prisk added:

> ""I am pleased that we are able to ask another local enterprise partnerships to appoint their board. The partnerships have an important role to play in driving local economic growth and creating a strong environment for business.
> 
> ""We are continuing to assess proposals for further partnerships across England, so that soon more local communities will benefit from the knowledge and expertise of the private sector and the opportunities that growth brings.""

London Councils' Executive Member for Economic Development, Councillor Chris Roberts said:

> ""In these tough economic times, it is vital for London Councils, boroughs and the mayor to work closely with businesses to create and support new investment in all areas of London.
> 
> ""It is therefore crucial that the local enterprise partnership operates in a framework which is flexible enough to accommodate borough based initiatives which have been developed locally to address the challenges of economic development.""

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:

> ""This new partnership will bring together a unique mix of business expertise and leadership that understands the needs of every part of the capital to drive forward economic growth. Working together in these difficult economic times, we will ensure no stone is left unturned in creating the right conditions to maximise the opportunities that are out there.
> 
> ""I am confident that building on the economic strategy we already have in place we can ensure that London continues to be the best city in the world for businesses to thrive in.""

Local enterprise partnerships will operate within a geography that reflects natural economic areas and will provide the vision, knowledge and strategic leadership needed to drive sustainable private sector growth and job creation in their area.

Ministers also announced today that partnerships are now able to bid for a share of the £4m capacity fund the Prime Minister announced in January. The Fund is intended to help local enterprise partnerships understand the issues facing businesses in their areas. Bids will be considered in light of the different needs identified by each partnership.

The London partnership aims to create new opportunities that build on London's knowledge base and its world-class Higher Education Institutions as well as supporting private sector job creation. It will also pilot and develop proposals for new and innovative ways of raising public finance.

The London Enterprise Partnership will work in the context of the Mayor's Economic Development Strategy, which has the following overarching aims:

  * promote London as the world capital of business

  * ensure that London has the most competitive business environment in the world

  * make London one of the world's leading low carbon capitals

  * increase economic opportunity

  * maximise the return from investment in the 2012 Olympic Games

Business will have a majority on the Board, which will include business leaders from across London, representatives of London's growth and employment sectors, pan London Business Leadership organisations, three borough leaders (to be proposed by London Councils) and third sector and higher education institutions.

The London partnership will work closely with the Kent, Essex and East Sussex partnership in also driving the growth of the Thames Gateway, through the new locally led Thames Gateway Strategic Group which met for the first time yesterday.

Londoners are already set to benefit from an unprecedented devolution of power from Whitehall under radical new plans in the Localism Bill that will see the city get greater powers over housing, regeneration, economic development, and Olympic legacy.

### Notes to editors

2. A map of approved local enterprise partnerships is available from [geocommons.com/maps/32888](http://geocommons.com/maps/32888) (external link).

3. Proposals for partnerships were assessed in line with the expectations set out in the 29 June 2010 letter from the Business Secretary and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. The letter is available to donwload here: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/local/localenterprisepartnerships/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/regenerationfunding/localenterprisepartnerships/).

4. Specifically, the Local Growth White Paper proposes that local enterprise partnerships will be able to consider a diverse range of roles, reflecting the differing local priorities in different areas, including:

  * working with Government to set out key investment priorities, including transport infrastructure
  * coordinating proposals or bidding directly for the Regional Growth Fund
  * supporting high growth businesses, for example through involvement in bids to run the new growth hubs
  * participation in the development of national planning policy and ensuring business is involved in the consideration of strategic planning applications
  * lead changes in how businesses are regulated locally
  * strategic housing delivery, including pooling and aligning funding streams
  * working with local employers, Jobcentre Plus and learning providers to help local workless people into jobs
  * coordinating approaches to leverage funding from the private sector
  * exploring opportunities for developing incentives on renewable energy projects and Green Deal
  * involvement in the delivery of other national priorities such as digital infrastructure

Revised proposals from partnerships which have not yet been approved will be welcomed by Government as they become ready.

5. The £4m Capacity Fund will be spread over four years, £1m per year, and the deadline for bids for the first round closing at midnight on March 31 2011 and the second round will open later this year. Ministers are seeking bids which address gaps in intelligence available to the Partnerships, facilitate business engagement and interaction with Partnerships, or boost board capacity to prioritise actions which will support business-led growth and jobs within the Partnership's area.

6. Radical new plans will see the Mayor of London and Borough councils and neighbourhoods handed greater decision making powers over the city's housing, regeneration, economic development, and Olympic legacy as part of the Localism Bill: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1785519](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1785519).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1856372,Capitalisation guidance published to help councils deliver early savings,"To help councils deliver efficiency savings early through organisational restructuring, the Government is providing £300 million of flexibility - through capitalisation - in the next financial year, Local Government Minister Bob Neill announced today.

Capitalisation is where the Government permits councils, in special circumstances, to treat revenue costs as capital costs. This increases their flexibility, because they can then meet those costs using their existing  borrowing powers or capital receipts, for example, from asset sales.

While capitalisation will provide important support, it will be for councils to assess how they best manage costs overall from their own resources, including prudent and appropriate use of their £10bn of reserves.

The nation faces an unprecedented financial situation and every part of the public sector, including local government - which accounts for a quarter of all public expenditure - has a part to play in cutting the deficit.

In order to provide authorities with clarity early in the financial year, the timetable for capitalisation is being brought forward. Decisions can be expected in July, nearly six months earlier than in previous years.

Guidance for how councils should apply has been issued today. The deadline for applications is 12 May.

Mr Neill said:

> ""Every council knew they would have tough decisions to make to play their part in cutting the deficit because councils account for around a quarter of all public expenditure.
> 
> ""The majority of councils are planning sensibly for leaner budgets and this round of capitalisation will give councils more flexibility in the coming year, whilst keeping costs within wider public spending plans.
> 
> ""Prudent use of their £10bn of reserves can help councils to manage transformational change whilst protecting frontline services.""

### Notes for editors

1. Capitalisation is the means by which the Government, exceptionally, permits authorities to treat revenue costs as capital costs. The costs can then be funded from borrowing or capital receipts, thereby increasing an authority's financial flexibility. Since capitalisation is a relaxation of normal accounting requirements, it has always been subject to an application process, with applications assessed against strict criteria.

2. Regardless of whether the capitalised expenditure is funded through borrowing or the use of receipts (e.g from asset sales), capitalisation scores as revenue expenditure in the national accounts. It therefore impacts directly on the deficit reduction programme, and is important that capitalisation is strictly controlled.

3. The Spending Review announced that £200m of capitalisation would be available in 2011-12. Following representations from authorities, the Government has decided to increase the amount to £300m. The Government is not providing authorities with extra funding for this purpose, but simply allowing a managed and affordable extension of existing flexibilities.

4. The main application deadline is being brought forward. While there will be a limited second process later in the financial year, the main deadline is 12 May 2011. All authorities applying to capitalise statutory redundancy costs should apply by that deadline. The majority of the capitalisation limit will be allocated in the main process. The guidance is on the DCLG website at: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/capitalfinance/capitalisation/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/capitalfinance/capitalisation/)

5. The capitalisation categories and criteria have been revised since 2010-11. This is set out in Section 2 of the guidance. Consideration of the level of reserves will be a key part of the assessment process. As has been the case in previous years, the Government will look at the total reserves for each authority (excluding schools reserves), including both 'earmarked' and unallocated reserves, since earmarking of reserves in itself does not exclude use for other purposes.

6. The guidance does not cover equal pay capitalisation. Decisions have not yet been taken on equal pay capitalisation policy for 2011-12.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1952417,Capitalisation guidance published to help councils deliver equal pay,"The Government will allow councils to apply to borrow and sell against their assets to help councils tackle historic pay inequalities while protecting frontline services, Local Government Minister Bob Neill has announced.

Thousands of local government employees - mostly women on low pay - are legally entitled to backdated pay following years of being paid less for doing equally valued jobs. Equal pay directions give local authorities the financial flexibility to settle their equal pay commitments over an affordable period of time by raising money on their assets.

Without this, compensation costs would have to be met within the financial year and could disrupt frontline services.

Guidance for how councils should apply has been issued. The deadline for applications is 16 September 2011. Last October the Government announced  21 councils had the go-ahead to borrow against or sell assets up to £250 million to meet and manage one-off costs of equal pay compensation.

Mr Neill said:

> ""We are again giving councils this financial flexibility to tackle the unfair pay inequalities of the past, which saw thousands of hard working council staff, mainly women underpaid for doing the same work as their colleagues.
> 
> ""As councils work hard to manage their budgets in the current financial climate, it is all the more important they have this flexibility to settle their equal pay commitments while still protecting frontline services and keeping council tax low.
> 
> ""Guidance for councils on how to apply to raise money on their assets has been published and the deadline for applications is September 16 2011.""

Notes to editors

1. The Equalities Act (2010) which has replaced the Equal Pay Act (1970), sets out in legislation that all employees are entitled to be paid equally for 'work of equal value'. Once historical gender pay inequalities are exposed, employees are legally entitled to claim up to six years of arrears of remuneration or damages.

2. Since 2006 central government has given councils permission to raise over £1.89 billion for equal pay costs under a process known as capitalisation. Capitalisation directions give permission to local authorities to meet revenue costs out of capital resources, either through borrowing or capital receipts.

3. The guidance for applicants to the 2011-12 equal pay capitalisation round can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/equalpaycapdirections201112](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/equalpaycapdirections201112).

With only half of people claiming they test their smoke alarm regularly, the clock change milestone is the perfect opportunity for everyone to test their alarm as they are already going around their homes putting the clocks back.

The campaign, which can be seen in national newspapers and heard on the airwaves this weekend, will come to an end on Sunday 30 October 2011.

Several organisations, including the Post Office, Energizer and Poundland have also been involved, spreading the message to their customers and staff.

Sir Terry Wogan said:

> ""A smoke alarm can give you the vital time you need to escape a house fire, but often people don't take the time to test their alarm is working. It doesn't take long and could save lives. When the clocks change at the end of the month, I'll be checking my smoke alarm.""

Dave Spikey said:

> ""I'll be checking the batteries in my smoke alarm on 30 October as being fire safe is very important. A working smoke alarm can give you the early warning you and your loved ones need to escape in a house fire.""

We're asking everyone to keep their family, friends and neighbours safe this weekend by testing. If you know somebody less able to reach their smoke alarm, why not offer to test it for them?

Don't forget to:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1707789,Changes to Audit Commission board announced,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill announced reappointments to the Board of the Audit Commission today, as part of plans to move its audit functions into the private sector.

Lord Adebowale of Thornes and Bharat Shah have both agreed to continue to serve on the Board until the end of 2012.

In addition to these reappointments, further Commissioners will be recruited to the Board, by open competition, to bring in new private sector expertise as the Commission focuses on its new challenges. An advert for the available posts will be posted on the Public Appointments website shortly.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced in August plans to disband the Commission after 2012 and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

The Audit Commission's in-house audit practice, which is the fifth largest audit practice in the country, is to be transferred out of public ownership after 2012. Over the next year a range of options will be developed for converting the audit practice into a business independent of Government which could be sold or otherwise transferred into the private sector.

Mr Pickles thanked Dame Denise Platt, Dr Raj Rajagopal, and Jenny Watson, whose terms as Commissioners finished in August, for their contributions to the work of the Audit Commission.

Bob Neill said:

> ""I'm pleased to announce that Lord Adebowale and Bharat Shah have both agreed to continue to serve as Commissioners. There will also be some new appointments to the Commission as we make plans to move it into the private sector. These appointments will be by open competition and we are keen to bring in private sector expertise and skills to help with the upcoming transition.
> 
> ""This Department will be working closely with the Audit Commission, the accountancy profession, and the local government and health sectors to develop the detailed design of the new systems.
> 
> ""I would like to thank all departing Commissioners for their contributions to the Audit Commission's work.""

In the future councils will be free to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market; and there will be a new audit framework for local health bodies. This will save council taxpayers' money and decentralise power.

### Notes to editors

Lord Victor Adebowale and Bharat Shah's reappointments have been made in accordance with the Commissioner for Public Appointments' Code of Practice for ministerial appointments to public bodies. All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees' political activity (if any declared) to be made public.

Bharat Shah's appointment will cover the period up until 31 December 2012. As Deputy Chair of the Commission's board, he will be paid £23,931 per annum based on a time commitment of 5 days per month. Bharat Shah does not hold any other Ministerial public appointments. He has declared that he has not engaged in any political activity in the last 5 years.

Lord Adebowale's appointment will also cover the period up until 31 December 2012. He will be paid £14,358 per annum based on a time commitment of 3 days per month. Lord Adebowale does not hold any other Ministerial public appointments. He has declared that he has not engaged in any political activity in the last 5 years.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended last month by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""English counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Viscount Ashbrook, Vice Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire said:

> ""I am delighted that the Ceremonial Flag of Cheshire is being flown by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

But this is just the time when additional fire hazards are in the home. A few simple precautions can keep families safe to celebrate.

A recent survey carried out by Rockwool, a manufacturer of non-combustible insulation and partner of the Government's Fire Kills campaign, has highlighted the hazards. These arise from factors such as increased use of candles, fairy lights, and extra home cooking.

The campaign is urging people not to leave burning candles and cooking unattended, and to unplug Christmas tree lights at night as well as when you leave the house. Simple precautions like these can make sure everyone enjoys the festive traditions that make Christmas special.

Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Christmas is a time for having fun with family and friends; however, it is also a time when extra fire hazards are introduced to the home such as fairy lights, candles and decorations. We are urging you to think about fire safety ahead of the Christmas period, ensure your fairy lights conform to a British or European standard, place candles in holders and away from curtains, and never leave cooking unattended. Following simple guidelines will make sure everyone is safe to enjoy the festivities.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1987982,Cities to bid for new powers to spark economic growth,"England's biggest cities will be able to make their case for new powers from central government to drive faster growth under new clauses to the Localism Bill which were welcomed by Cities Minister Greg Clark and Chris Murray, Director of the Core Cities Group, today.

The Localism Bill aims to deliver a legacy of empowered cities that can drive private sector growth and jobs. The changes means city leaders, alongside the area's local enterprise partnership, can make the case for being given new powers to promote economic growth and set their own distinctive policies.

This amendment opens the door to greater local control over investment to drive growth, for example for housing and planning, economic development, or pooling resources and effort across functioning economic areas. It means cities can be more joined-up about local investment, moving on from case by case funding applications, saving time and money.

Ministers are listening to what cities say they need as the Government seeks to rebalance the economy, by empowering local civic and business leaders to create jobs and growth. Instead of imposing solutions the Government will strike deals with cities that give local authorities freedoms to set their own policies where they make a strong case for greater devolution.

According to independent forecasts, if the Core Cities were given greater freedoms they would be able to deliver an extra one million jobs and £44billion to the economy in the next decade across their local enterprise partnership areas.

The UK's 'Core Cities' urban areas - Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield - are the main drivers of the economy outside London and the South East, delivering 27 per cent of the national economy.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Dynamic cities are essential to faster economic growth across the UK so it's vital they have the means to exploit their potential.
>

### Notes to editors

1. The Government believes cities are vital for our national prosperity and are also hugely important for the economies of their surrounding areas. Greg Clark was made the Cities Minister earlier this year and the Deputy Prime Minister chairs a new Ministerial Group on cities that coordinate policy on the challenges facing cities.

2. Research commissioned by Core Cities shows that High Speed rail, plus investment in existing and local networks, could help to support the creating of an additional 1 million jobs across their local Enterprise Partnership areas: [www.corecities.com/news-events/high-speed-rail-could-underpin-1-million-jobs-across-core-cities-areas](http://www.corecities.com/news-events/high-speed-rail-could-underpin-1-million-jobs-across-core-cities-areas) (external link).

This forecast was originally commissioned for _Our Cities, Our Future_ (Core Cities 2011) which can be found at: [www.corecities.com/what-we-do/publications/our-cities-our-future-core-cities-seminar-report](http://www.corecities.com/what-we-do/publications/our-cities-our-future-core-cities-seminar-report) (external link).

3. The Core Cities together with their surrounding urban areas:

  * are home to 16 million people, almost a third of the population of England
  * generate 27 per cent of England's wealth (more than London)
  * are home to half of the country's leading research universities; and,
  * contain 28 per cent of highly skilled workers (graduate level or above).

Core Cities Group is a collaboration between the eight city authorities and has been running for 15 years. More information can be found at: [www.corecities.com/about-us](http://www.corecities.com/about-us) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2072389,'City deals' to be widened across England,"More cities in England will be offered the chance to agree a bespoke deal with Government to unlock their potential to drive economic growth, Cities Minister Greg Clark announced today in a major speech to the Centre for Cities.

The Government is freeing-up cities from the control of Whitehall to unlock their potential as engines of growth through a series of 'city deals' from the spring, giving them the powers they need to attract private sector investment, create new jobs, and rebalance the economy.

In return, cities must guarantee that they can provide strong and accountable leadership, improve efficiency and outcomes, and be innovative in their approach.

Negotiations on the first wave of deals have already started with England's eight largest cities outside of London: Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield.

Today Greg Clark announced he was extending the offer of a bespoke city deal to more of England's cities, beyond the main ones, and invited them to start considering their proposals.

An initial menu of possible transformative powers, including greater freedoms to invest in growth, and new ways for cities to boost jobs and apprenticeships, were set out in _Unlocking Growth in Cities_, published in December. The Government's Cities Unit will lead the negotiation process on behalf of Whitehall.

Greg Clark said:

> ""The battle for economic growth - for Britain's future, will be won or lost in our cities. Right now our cities face serious challenges, but what isn't in doubt is their huge potential to drive economic growth. The key to unlocking that potential is a new deal for cities. Giving cities the powers, control over resources, and funding they need to fire on all cylinders and attract the private sector investment needed to rebalance the economy. But this revival will depend on all of Britain's cities, not just the few. That's why today I am inviting more cities to consider the vision they have for their community and the deal they need to make it happen.
> 
> ""We are turning the established order on its head and cities must come to Whitehall not as supplicants, as in the past, but as equal participants in an open and constructive deal making process.""

Cities will need to make a clear case for new powers, backed with evidence and a strong economic rationale. And where Whitehall wants to retain control the burden will be on central Government to explain why it is necessary.

City deals are the next step in Government's plans to grow local economies. Local Enterprise Partnerships are already encouraging local leaders to think and work together in ways that reflect their true economic geography. And the Regional Growth Fund and Enterprise Zones support the idea that local economies should be in the driving seat in encouraging entrepreneurs and private investment.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1842550,City of London flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic City of London has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place historic communities play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that local flags, including those of counties, cities and boroughs, to be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties, cities and boroughs continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their communities. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds us together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Alderman Michael Bear, Lord Mayor of the City of London, said:

> ""I am very pleased to hear that the Department for Communities and Local Government is, quite literally, flying the flag for the City of London this week. My colleagues and I are rightly proud of our City flag which flies over many buildings in the Square Mile - a centuries-old community with a rich and varied history.""

Stuart Fraser, Chairman of Policy at the City of London Corporation said:

> ""We are delighted for our flag to be recognised in this way. The City of London is modern and vibrant but steeped in history. It is the world's leading financial centre at the heart of global business as well as a 24-hour metropolis.""

The City of London is the oldest continuous municipal democracy in the world and predates Parliament. Its constitution is rooted in the ancient rights and privileges enjoyed by citizens before the Norman Conquest in 1066. The City of London developed a unique form of government which led to the system of parliamentary government at local and national level.

The right of the City to run its own affairs was gradually won as concessions were gained from the Crown. London's importance as a centre of trade, population and wealth secured it rights and liberties earlier than other towns and cities. From medieval to Stuart times the City was the major source of financial loans to monarchs, who sought funds to support their policies at home and abroad. Today the Court of Common Council (100 Common Councilmen and 25 Aldermen) governs the City of London Corporation, a uniquely diverse organisation. It supports and promotes the City as the world leader in international finance and business services and provides local services and policing for those working in, living in and visiting the Square Mile. It also provides valued services to London and the nation.

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

2. The City of London flag has been kindly loaned by the Association of British Counties at no charge.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1838364,New boost for community ownership as Government releases central hold on local assets,"Local communities will get the freedom to sell, rent or share community owned assets bought with central government money, such as council buildings, shops and business parks, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Ministers are ending rigid 'clawback rights' that stopped community and voluntary groups selling or changing the use of community land or buildings that were funded by specific historic government grant programmes. A legacy of centrally imposed restrictions meant that original grant funding was clawed back if one of these local assets were sold or their original purpose changed - even if the government scheme had long since ended.

Ministers are worried that this forces community owned assets to stay stagnant and potentially unused when the land or building could be serving the community. Community and voluntary groups need to be given the freedom and flexibility to use their assets in a way that best meets the area's changing needs.

The removal of 'clawback rights' busts a barrier imposed on local communities by central government. Communities will now be free to use their assets as security to obtain loans to sustain or expand their activities. If an asset is too expensive or no longer fit for purpose they will be able to sell it and move to more appropriate premises that better meets the needs of local people.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Community and voluntary groups who know their area best need a real say on how their local services, buildings and businesses are run. I'm determined to bust every centrally imposed barrier that holds communities back from acting in the best interests of local people.
> 
> ""Today we're ending rigid central restrictions that stopped communities from maximising the potential of their public land and buildings by clawing back central funding. Ending clawback rights will put communities back in charge of community assets and gives them the freedom and flexibility to prioritise their current needs over dated central diktats.""

Councils, voluntary groups and social enterprises have also been invited to let Ministers know of other historic grant programmes where clawback rights have been applied in perpetuity preventing communities from making best use of their assets so that the government can consider whether the terms should be changed too.

Steve Wyler, Director of the Development Trusts Association, said:

> ""This is a fantastic start! For years DTA members have been campaigning for a level playing field. Clawback has meant that enterprising organisations, like our members, have been developing community assets with one hand tied behind their back, the removal of these restrictions will really support them to grow and benefit even more local people. DCLG is giving a great lead on this, let's hope the rest of Government follows suit.""

This is another significant step for communities to take control of their neighbourhoods as the Government pushes power away from the centre. Today's decision follows the launch of consultations on new Community Rights to Challenge local services and Buy vital community assets in the Localism Bill.

The consultations will run for 12 weeks, taking views from people, councils and their employees, community groups, voluntary organisations, private businesses and other interested parties.

Mr Clark has also called on councils to publish their spending on the voluntary and community sector as part of increasing transparency and opening up services locally.

Notes to editors

1. The Department of Communities and Local Government is today removing its capital clawback rights from four historic grant programmes:

  * Single Regeneration Budget (SRB)
  * Urban Programme
  * City Challenge
  * Inner Area Grants.

2. Ministers are also urging councils, voluntary groups and social enterprises to let them know of other historic grant programmes where clawback rights have been applied in perpetuity and are preventing communities from making best use of their assets.

3. Councils will mainly have been the accountable bodies for the grant programme above. They will often have passed some of that funding on to community and voluntary organisations to purchase and renovate assets. With clawback removed Ministers are now encouraging councils to remove any restrictions, such as a charge on the land or building, from community owned assets, giving these groups more flexibility to use the assets for the community.

4. The consultation document for Community Right to Challenge can be viewed online here: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/righttochallengeconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/righttochallengeconsultation) and the consultation document for Community Right to Buy can be viewed here: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/righttobuyconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/righttobuyconsultation).

5. Throughout the consultation period we will be speaking to a wide range of interested parties about the Community Right to Buy and Community Right to Challenge. We will be holding the following consultation events:

  * 9 March, Manchester
  * 22 March, Bristol
  * 31 March, Birmingham
  * 13 April, London

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1610193,New powers to prevent unwanted 'garden grabbing',"Councils and communities are being given immediate powers to prevent the destructive practice of 'garden grabbing' and to decide what types of homes are suitable for their area, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Over the last decade, many councils have been left frustrated at the increasing amount of inappropriate development on gardens which they have been unable to prevent. This is because planning guidance has classified gardens as 'previously residential land', in the same Brownfield category as derelict factories and disused railway sidings.

Recently published Government figures show that the proportion of new houses built on previously residential land such as gardens has risen dramatically, from one in ten to one in four between 1997 and 2008 - robbing communities of green breathing space, safe places for children to play and havens for urban wildlife.

Mr Clark is today unveiling plans to take gardens out of the Brownfield category, a simple step that will dramatically transform councils' ability to prevent unwanted development on gardens where local people object and protect the character of their neighbourhoods.

From today Mr Clark will also scrap the minimum density target so town halls can work with the local community to decide what new homes are best for their area. The target has contributed to the lack of family sized homes and flats that local people need. Councils will be able decide what level of density is appropriate for their area, and work with developers to deliver the right mix of homes for the local community, encouraging more  family homes and affordable housing.

Greg Clark said:

> ""For years the wishes of local people have been ignored as the character of neighbourhoods and gardens have been destroyed, robbing communities of vital green space.
> 
> ""It is ridiculous that gardens have until now been classified in the same group as derelict factories and disused railway sidings, forcing councils and communities to sit by and watch their neighbourhoods get swallowed up in a concrete jungle.  
   
""Today I am changing the classification of garden land so councils and communities no longer have their decisions constantly overruled, but have the power to work with industry to shape future development that is appropriate for their area.
> 
> ""This is just the start of wholesale reform I want to make to the planning system, so councils and communities are centre-stage in a reformed system that works for them, and is not just a tool of top-down policy.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The current system with its push for high density has resulted in developers building one or two bedroom executive flats, when the greatest need is often for affordable family homes. That's why from today communities will be allowed to make their own decisions about what homes are needed in their area, and no longer be victims of a system designed to maximise profits and minimise choice.""

Dr Ross Cameron, School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading added:

> ""There are real benefits that gardens bring to our quality of life. Vegetation around buildings keeps us cool in summer and reduces our energy bills in winter, as well as protecting us from flooding.
> 
> ""Gardens are also great for our mental and physical wellbeing. They reduce our stress and keep us fit because we can work in the garden for hours without feeling we are doing exercise as a chore.
> 
> ""Research has demonstrated that gardening can improve self-esteem, communication skills, attention span and even educational performance. In essence, protecting gardens is important to improve quality of life, and particularly for people in cities.""

### Notes to editors

2. Dr Simon Thornton Wood, Director of Science and Learning at the Royal Horticultural Society said:

> ""We welcome any measure that protects the vital resource we know gardens to be. Gardens like parks, are the green lungs of cities, improving air quality, controlling air temperature and flood risk and providing a haven for wildlife. Beyond these very practical benefits of gardens we know that gardening is great for physical and mental health. That's why we would like planning measures to go further than protecting existing gardens, to guarantee high quality green space and gardening opportunities in all new building developments, wherever they are.""

Richard Bashford - Project Manager, RSPB said:

> ""Gardens are mini nature reserves on our doorsteps and vital habitats for all sorts of wildlife. Many much loved species rely on green spaces like gardens, such as the song thrush and house sparrow, both of which have suffered massive declines in the last few years. House sparrow numbers have plummeted by over 60 per cent and we have lost almost 75 per cent of song thrushes. If more garden space is turned into buildings they will likely decline further and the wonder that children experience on the doorstep will dwindle.
> 
> ""We hope that the new measures will protect the habitats of species that have become synonymous with English gardens and demonstrate a rich eco system in our own back yards such as frogs, toads and bumble bees.""

2. The whole of any housing plot, including any garden, has been classed as ""Brownfield"" or previously developed land, in the same category and derelict factories and disused railway sidings. The new Government recognises the concerns that some people have about the loss of gardens, and is amending Planning Policy Statement 3 (PPS3) to remove the classification of 'previously developed land'. PPS3 can be viewed at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/pps3housing](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/planningandbuilding/pps3housing).

3. Reclassifying garden land will enable councils to protect gardens from inappropriate development by rejecting planning applications for development that is objected to by the local community and spoils the character of neighbourhoods.

4. Recent Government figures for 2008 show that 80 per cent of homes were built on Brownfield land, up from 56 per cent in 1997. However, this incorporates development on previously residential land that includes gardens, which has risen from 11 per cent to 23 per cent between 1997 and 2008.

5. A study by Kingston University that started in May 2009 and gathered feedback from 127 councils found garden grabbing to be a problem in councils from different areas of the country. The study can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/gardendevelopments](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/gardendevelopments).

6. The density target that was first introduced in PPG3 in 2000 encouraged councils to build new houses at a density of 30-50 dph and seek greater intensity of development in city and town centres. PPG3 was revised in 2006 and the minimum density target reduced to 30 dph in PPS3.

7. New build statistics show the decline in the number of houses built has largely been for 4+ bed houses, with small declines in 2 and 3 bed houses. There has been a corresponding proportionate increase in 2 bed flats.

8. Councils will be able to use their discretion and work with the local community to deliver the right mix of affordable homes for their area so no one is priced out of the place where they live.

9. The reclassification of gardens will not prevent making extensions to their homes. What it will do is give councils the power to reject planning applications for entirely new dwellings on garden land that are objected to by local people and ruin the character of the area.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1645906,Clark and Stunell prepare to bust some barriers,"Communities ministers Greg Clark and Andrew Stunell heard first-hand the problems community groups and social enterprises face in reaching their full potential from people working at the heart of these organisations during a 'barrier busting' event.

Ministers and officials met with representatives from 15 different community organisations in CLG's HQ. The aim was to find out what obstacles they have faced in providing services and facilities to their communities and more importantly what can be done to remove these barriers in the future.

### Identifying the issues

A number of problems were identified ranging from lack of accountancy and legal skills for smaller groups through to the amount of information required for funding applications. A small community group seeking a few thousand pounds will often have to provide the same, hard to obtain, information as a large national organisation applying for millions of pounds of funding.

The groups also told how they have had to overcome negative attitudes towards voluntary groups from some agencies who don't view them as equal partners and problems with bureaucracy around risk assessments and insurance.

This was the first Big Society Practitioner Roundtable - hosted by Ministers at CLG's offices in London - and follows the Prime Minister's visit to Liverpool at the beginning of the week where he set out how the Big Society will redistribute power from the state to the individual.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1772640,Communities to share in the advantages of development,"New reforms will give more of the benefits of development to communities while providing more certainty for industry, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Councils and communities will have more control over how new infrastructure in towns and cities is funded, and more of the money will benefit the neighbourhoods where new developments are built.

Mr Clark confirmed a Community Infrastructure Levy, introduced by the previous Government in April 2010, would be continued because it provides a fairer system to fund new infrastructure. The levy will give councils the option to raise funds from developers building new projects in their area, and provide a more certain and flexible system for housebuilders, cutting the costs of lengthy legal negotiations.

However, the levy will be reformed to ensure neighbourhoods share the advantages of development by receiving a proportion of the funds councils raise from developers. These will be passed directly to the local neighbourhood so community groups can spend the money locally on the facilities they want, either by contributing to larger projects funded by the council, or funding smaller local projects like park improvements, playgrounds and cycle paths.

The new system will be more transparent with levy rates set in consultation with local communities and developers, unlike planning obligations that are negotiated behind closed doors. Developers will know upfront exactly how much they will be expected to pay towards infrastructure, enabling them to work out costs earlier.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Communities should reap the benefits of new development in their area and these reforms will put in place a fairer system for funding new infrastructure while also providing certainty for industry.
> 
> ""Too little of the benefits of development go to local communities, and our ambition is to correct that with a reformed levy under genuine local control. Neighbourhoods will now get a direct cut of the cash paid by developers to councils - to spend how they wish to benefit the community, from parks and schools to roads, playgrounds and cycle paths.
> 
> ""Our decentralising changes will also benefit developers through a system that is flexible, predictable and transparent while also cutting the red tape and bureaucracy faced by councils.
> 
> ""Alongside the New Homes Bonus, this is another way to make sure communities benefit from development in their area. It will help change the debate about development from opposition to optimism.""

### Notes to editors

1. All but the very smallest building projects will contribute to the levy ensuring communities reap the rewards of new development in their area. The neighbourhood funds will complement powerful incentives that will be delivered through the New Homes Bonus. Under the new scheme, communities that support the construction of new homes will receive direct and substantial extra funding to spend as they wish.

2. Other changes include:

  * more control for councils over the levy. Independent examiners will ensure councils do not set unreasonably high levies, but councils will control the detail of what type of levy rate is charged, including what rates are set for specific areas and types of development; and
  * allowing councils to set their own flexible payment deadlines and offer the developers the option to pay by instalments. The £50,000 minimum threshold for payments in kind will also be scrapped so councils can accept a payment in kind for any level of contribution.

3. Mr Clark also confirmed no significant changes will be made to the current rules about planning obligations, also known as Section 106 agreements. They will continue to fund affordable housing, and will remain scaled back so they directly relate to the proposed development. In recent years the use of planning obligations to secure cash contributions to general infrastructure needs had grown in scope and complexity, and often resulted in years of protracted negotiations that delayed development and were a drain on council resources. The levy ensures proper transparency and fairness over such contributions.

4. Councils will monitor the use of the levy and provide regular reports to ensure that local people understand how new development brings benefits to their area. Affordable and social housing projects as well as charity developments will be exempt from the levy.

5. The new Government believes it is reasonable for developers to make a contribution towards additional infrastructure that is needed as a result of their development. The Government also believes a tariff-based approach provides the most satisfactory framework to fund new infrastructure. Therefore, after careful consideration, the Government has decided to retain the Community Infrastructure Levy. However, in order to retain the levy it will be reformed to ensure it:

  * hands more power to councils and communities to decide what they want the levy to fund; and
  * is simple and transparent for local communities and provides clarity to the development industry.

6. The levy will not apply to the vast majority of household extensions as they will be less than the threshold of 100 sq m (the average house size in the UK is 76sq m). 

7. Some changes to the levy will require amendments to legislation and regulations. The Government will include provisions in the Localism Bill to limit the binding nature of examiners' reports, and amend the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 to give local communities more control over the levy, and make it more responsive to local needs.

8. The Government will require charging authorities to allocate a meaningful proportion of their levy revenues raised in each neighbourhood back to that neighbourhood to spend on the infrastructure that local people consider is most needed.

9. Local authorities will work closely with neighbourhood bodies to ensure that the levy can help provide for their infrastructure needs. This could mean working with neighbourhoods to decide what infrastructure is needed, as well as giving levy money to neighbourhoods affected by a new development in their area.

10. Local authorities will retain the ability to use the levy where it is needed in their area to address the cumulative impact on infrastructure that may occur further away from the development. They will need to balance neighbourhood funding with wider infrastructure funding needed to support growth.

11. The report, _Valuing Planning Obligations in England: Update Study for 2005-06_, published by Sheffield University in 2008 showed that only six per cent of planning permissions made any contribution to the cost of new infrastructure via planning obligations.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1763000,Coalition plans a 'power shift' from Whitehall: new government business plans announced,"The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister published today, for the first time, Business Plans for government departments that will set out in detail the work of the Government for the next four years.

They mark the start of a major change in the way government works and will bring about a power shift in favour of increased Government accountability directly to the public.

The Department for Communities and Local Government business plan sets out what the Department will do to deliver its key priorities:

  * decentralise power as far as possible
  * reinvigorate accountability, democracy and participation
  * increase transparency by letting people see how their money is being spent
  * meet people's housing aspirations
  * put communities in charge of planning

Secretary of State Eric Pickles welcomed the publication saying:

> ""Our purpose is to make a radical redistribution of power and funding from government to local people to deliver what they want for their communities, transforming public services.
> 
> ""Localism isn't simply about giving power back to local government. We will push power downwards and outwards to the lowest possible level - so that power is held by local people. People want more for less in their services and we will free up councils to make that happen.
> 
> ""We want people to have control over the decisions that affect them. Big Society encourages family and social responsibility plus civil liberties to create a stronger society. We want people to feel both free and powerful enough to help themselves and their own communities and be the building blocks of localism. They will be re-energised and empowered to enable ideas to flow from local people and enterprises.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1605964,Communities are doing it for themselves: The Archers show how it can be done,"_The Archers_ may be nearing its 60th year, but it is still leading the way, with the Ambridge inhabitants saving their local shop through pioneering community action.

The people of Ambridge, the fictional village in which _The Archers_ is set, have stepped up and taken over their local shop when it was on the brink of closure.

The set-up is fictional, but the issue is real enough. Community ownership now saves around 10 per cent of village shop closures, and there are more than 200 real community-owned shops in the UK, run in a variety of ways - whatever best suits the needs of the local people. It is a great example of a group of people coming together to solve an issue that affects their everyday lives.

By encouraging involvement in social action, the Government hopes that communities of all kinds will increasingly show this kind of resourcefulness to help each other and improve their local neighbourhoods. People at the grass roots level generally know better than anyone else how things should be done best in their area.

Greg Clark, Minister for Decentralisation said:

> ""I'd like to congratulate the people of Ambridge for taking the initiative and successfully saving the hub of the village!
> 
> ""There are real people doing similar things all over the country. This Government wants to make it easier for communities to help one another and improve their local area. We'll be giving new powers to help them save local facilities that are facing closure. I hope many more communities will feel inspired to take charge of the things that are important to them.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1647387,Communities are ready for the Big Society,"Only a minority of people feel that they can influence local decisions or have engaged in some form of civic participation in the last year, according to survey findings published today.

The Big Society launched by the Prime Minister on Monday aims to address this and give more power and responsibility to communities. The plans will support local areas so they can take an active part in tackling local problems and contributing to decisions that affect them.

The survey asked 16,000 people for their views on civic engagement, volunteering, community cohesion and discrimination. The results, covering the year 2009-10, show that a large majority of people thought their community was cohesive, agreeing that their local area was a place where people from different backgrounds got on well together.

While trust in Parliament was at its lowest level since the survey began, people's satisfaction with their local area has increased and there was an overall reduction in the number of people who felt that racial harassment is a problem.

Although levels of civic participation and volunteering are low, cohesive communities, in which people feel they belong, should provide a strong foundation on which to build the Big Society.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""It's good news that the great majority of people get on well with each other and are satisfied with their local area. But levels of volunteering and civic participation could be higher. We want to see communities all over the country in which high numbers of people are actively engaged in making their neighbourhood better and are giving something back.
> 
> ""At the same time as we are showing people that we trust them to know what will work best in their local area, we are also greatly increasing transparency and openness in the processes of Parliament and Government.
> 
> ""Everyone has a part to play in building the Big Society. The Government's job is to make sure that individuals and community groups have the freedom and tools to enable them to get involved in civic and social action or to build on the good work they are already engaged in.""

The Prime Minister David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced four places that will act as test beds for realising the Big Society ideals. Many people would like to do more in their communities but either don't know where to start or come up against obstacles. The four vanguard areas will be able to call on civil servants to help them remove hurdles and get action off the ground. A community organiser for each area will be trained up and it will be their job to help stimulate and organise local involvement in community action.

The National Citizen Service, launched today, will also encourage volunteering and will give every 16 year old the chance to develop the skills needed to be active citizens and to mix with people from different backgrounds. Minister for Civil Society, Nick Hurd, today announced a series of pilots to take place next year.

### Notes to editors

1. The findings are from the Citizenship Survey, a face to face household survey carried out on behalf of Communities and Local Government. It covers a representative core sample of almost 10,000 adults in England and Wales each year, with a minority ethnic boost sample of 5,000 and a Muslim boost sample of 1,200 to ensure that the views of these groups are robustly represented. It asks about a range of issues including views about the local area, community cohesion, racial and religious prejudice and discrimination, values, interaction/mixing, political efficacy, civic engagement, volunteering and charitable giving. The survey was first carried out in 2001.

2. The survey results are issued quarterly and are cumulative throughout the year. These latest results are for the last quarter of 09-10 and therefore include the full year results. The full Statistical Release for the 2009-10 Citizenship Survey can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/citizenshipsurveyq4200910](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/citizenshipsurveyq4200910).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2021267,Communities asked to contribute their views on powers for new elected mayors,"Cities Minister Greg Clark is asking the residents of 12 English cities to contribute their views on what powers they would like an elected mayor to be able to exercise on their behalf.

In May 2010, the Coalition Agreement set out Government's commitment to create directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Leicester has recently elected a Mayor. The Government is now planning for referendums to take place in 11 other cities - Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield - in May 2012.  Where people vote in favour, the city will move to an elected mayor.

The Government is seeking to ensure that these elected mayors have powers that are properly suited to local circumstances. Rather than imposing a standard set of powers, the Government is launching a consultation to give local people a say over what they would want a mayor to be able to do on their behalf.

The consultation invites people who live and work in the 12 cities to contribute their views on the proposed approach for giving powers to city mayors, the powers that should be transferred, and on how mayors can best be subject to local scrutiny.

Mr Clark said:

> ""English cities aren't just home to millions of people; they are cultural powerhouses and economic dynamos. Cities will play a crucial role in driving and sustaining our economic recovery, and I will do everything in my power to help them thrive.
> 
> ""Evidence from London and beyond shows the difference elected mayors can make. They can provide strong and visible leadership, and take the tough decisions needed to attract jobs and investment for the future.
> 
> ""Every city has its own unique needs, identity and character. There's no such thing as a ""one size fits all"" mayor - they should be able to do whatever it takes to get to grips with the local challenges and help their city flourish. That's why I'm asking the people who live and work in our 12 largest cities - what could a mayor do for you?""

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation document 'What can a mayor do for your city?' is available at [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/mayorsconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/mayorsconsultation). The consultation runs until 3 January 2012.

2. A 2004 survey showed that 57 per cent of the public could name their elected mayor from a prompt list, compared to just a quarter who could name their council leader.

3. The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to creating directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London. The Localism Bill will give areas the right to have an elected Mayor. Following Royal Assent secondary legislation will be laid in Parliament which, if approved, will provide for these cities to hold mayoral referendums on the local Election Day in May 2012.

4. If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that that city will then rapidly hold an election for its first mayor. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

5. The proposals in this consultation paper relate solely to the 12 cities, and Mayors elected in other places would not be affected by them.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2041720,Communities come together to show their enthusiasm for neighbourhood planning,"Communities came together on Monday 28 November 2011 to discuss how new planning powers are allowing them to shape the look and feel of their neighbourhoods.

Neighbourhood Planning gives communities a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area. For the first time local people have a say over the location of new homes, the shops they want to see in the High Street and the design of buildings. They are also able to decide on the green spaces they want protected.

Community representatives from 23 of the frontrunner projects trialling new neighbourhood planning powers learnt from each other ways to develop plans. They were able to share experiences of best practice first hand and highlight any challenges faced and overcome as part of the process.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark, who joined the event to hear people's experience of the process, said:

> ""This event demonstrated the real enthusiasm around the country for neighbourhood planning. People are genuinely eager to learn how to shape development in their area and bring about the homes, jobs and shops they want.
> 
> ""We've already got 126 communities trialling powers and have had many more communities telling us they are eager to grasp this opportunity to make their own decisions on planning. There's a real appetite to bring forward sustainable development from people who for too long have been shut out of the planning process with no real voice.""

The Department's officials were on hand to answer questions along with representatives from Locality, Planning Aid (part of the Royal Town Planning Institute), the Campaign to Protect Rural England (who were also representing the National Association of Local Councils), and the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment - the organisations that have received funding to provide practical advice on neighbourhood planning to communities.

The Localism Act will introduce powers that gives local people the power to decide the types of development that can be granted automatic planning permission, through a Neighbourhood Development Order.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1917128,Communities get power to protect green spaces,"People are to be given the ability to protect environmentally and locally important special green spaces, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman announced today.

The Natural Environment White Paper, published today, includes proposals to give communities new powers to designate protected green areas as part of local neighbourhood plans.

Local communities will be able to earmark for special consideration local 'green space' land - whether its value is in its natural beauty, its historic resonances, its recreational value, its tranquillity or its importance as wildlife habitat.

The recent National Ecosystem Assessment concluded that the health benefits of living close to a green space are worth up to £300 per person per year. Urban green spaces can affect house values, mental wellbeing, air and water quality, carbon absorption and can provide natural flood defences and drainage. More information on the UK National Ecosystem Assessment can be found here [uknea.unep-wcmc.org/](http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/) (external link).

Two of the main ambitions of the planning system are protecting the natural environment and promoting sustainable growth. Ministers believe these are mutually compatible aims and they will form the basis of Government planning policy reforms. Protected sites should complement and not undermine investment in homes, jobs and other essential services.

A new National Planning Policy Framework that will consolidate nearly 900,000 words of unwieldy national planning policies into one concise, easy to use document setting out the Government's key economic, social and environmental objectives will be published shortly.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Green spaces are incredibly important to local life which is why this government is committed to protecting them. These are special areas that invigorate communities like local beauty spots, wildlife habitats or even local playing fields so important for healthy activities.
> 
> ""Promoting economic growth and protecting our natural environment are the two ambitions of our planning reforms. By giving local people greater control over much loved green spaces we are placing the strongest emphasis on the protection of the environment and local communities' interests. We are also making sure that what we decide today leaves a positive and sustainable legacy for future generations.""

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

> ""Giving communities the power to protect green spaces in towns and cities important to their local environment will benefit the wellbeing of people and wildlife. The natural environment matters to all of us, we all have an interest in protecting it and making it better. Working together we can be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we found it.
> 
> ""I hope that the Government's White Paper will inspire more people to enjoy nature from an early age and pass that passion for the environment down through the generations. That would be a legacy well worth leaving.""

Neighbourhood planning is a key reform that will give local people a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area; from determining the parks, playing fields and beauty spots as well as the location of shops, offices and schools or setting green standards of design for new housing.

Publishing details of the green space designation ahead of the formal consultation on the National Planning Policy Framework gives communities the certainty that the planning system will continue to protect the natural environment in their area. The power would be introduced by April 2012.

### Notes to editors

1. The Natural Environment White Paper states:

> ""We will consult later this year on proposals for a new Green Areas Designation that will give local people an opportunity to protect green spaces that have significant importance to their local communities and aim to introduce the Designation by April 2012. We propose that green spaces should be identified in neighbourhood plans and local plans which complement and do not undermine investment in homes, jobs and other essential services. Given the importance of green spaces to the health and happiness of local communities the Government considers the new designation should offer suitably strong protection to localised areas that are demonstrably special and will consult on that basis.""

2. The Communities Secretary is overseeing a programme of work announced at the Budget to unblock the planning system, boost house building and attract new investment into the market, maintain environmental and countryside protections. The reforms will put local councils, communities and local firms in the lead when it comes to delivering growth.

3. This programme includes a commitment to introduce a strong presumption in favour of sustainable development in the forthcoming National Planning Policy Framework, which will expect local planning authorities to plan positively for new development; to deal promptly and favourably with applications that comply with up-to-date plans and national planning policies; and wherever possible to approve applications where plans are absent, out of date, silent or indeterminate.

The 'Your Park, Your Place' competition is asking the public to suggest names that reflect the history and character of the Park, from its recent past as a manufacturing centre to its aspirations for the future. Entries that inspire a sense of local character and history will give the local community a real sense of ownership over the Park.

The Olympic Park Legacy Company's plans for the five neighbourhoods vary, with some areas focused on residential and leisure use, while others could become business hubs or play host to cultural attractions, venues and events.

Olympic Legacy Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""This competition will leave a tangible legacy for generations to come. I hope that having a chance to name areas within the Olympic Park will mean that people already living there can make sure their local knowledge and identity helps form the character of their area. It's a fantastic opportunity for communities to have a real sense of ownership of the Olympic Park and  I look forward to judging the many and varied suggestions.""

To help people get a feel for the new neighbourhoods the competition website (see related links, top right) includes an interactive map with details of the areas' histories and of plans for their future.

People have eight weeks to make their suggestions to the Olympic Park Legacy Company at [www.legacycompany.co.uk/competition/](http://www.legacycompany.co.uk/competition/) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1952235,Communities interns tell Nick Clegg their ideas for the future,"The importance of the youth voice in shaping future communities was emphasised after young interns working at the Department presented their inspiring and creative ideas to the Deputy Prime Minister.

In a meeting attended by Communities ministers Greg Clark and Andrew Stunell, Aisha Bi, from the British Youth Council, highlighted the work of her and her fellow interns in the Department to engage more young people in their local communities.

Since January three young interns, Aisha Bi, Catriona Duncan and Fahim Ahmed have been working with officials and Ministers in the Department and offering their unique insight on the development of policy. The interns are on placement within the Department through the British Youth Council which works to empower young people across the country to have their say.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Working with the interns has been illuminating and their determined approach is an inspiration to other young people.
> 
> ""Across the country thousands of young people are raring to have their voices heard and get more involved in the development of their communities.
> 
> ""It makes sense that Government, rather than constraining young people, listens to their expertise and unique insight, empowering them to ensure that local services suit the needs of their local communities.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""We believe in driving power down to communities, the people are the boss and they are best placed to decide what is needed in their local area. Rather than telling young people what to do and how to do it we are asking them what stands in their way and helping them to do something about it.
> 
> ""The impressive achievements of the young interns in the Department are further proof that young people have the ambition, enthusiasm and ideas to make a positive difference to their communities when given the opportunity.""

Aisha Bi said:

> ""If you listen out young people have a lot of really great ideas about involving their friends and changing their communities. I am proud of my work at the Department and I genuinely feel that as a young person my voice is being heard. Meeting the Deputy Prime minister and highlighting some barriers that put some young people off getting involved has been the icing on the cake, if not a little nerve wracking! More and more people my age should feel motivated to get involved knowing that their ideas can turn into real action.""

The Government will today publish a report on the steps they've taken and the significant progress that's been made, including measures to increase security for Jewish faith schools in the state sector and improving the collection of data on antisemitic incidents.

Education Secretary Michael Gove last week confirmed up to £2 million to fund tighter security measures in Jewish faith schools in the state sector. This funding will ensure children and staff will have a school environment safe from antisemitic incidents.

Ministers have also secured agreement that all police forces must now record antisemitic hate crimes, with the first official statistics published last month. This greater transparency provides the clearest picture yet of where and when hate crimes are likely to occur, thereby making it easier to target security measures.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""It's unacceptable that such a high number of antisemitic incidents are still happening.
> 
> ""The measures announced today will increase protection for Jewish communities and improve our evidence base, making it easier to determine what further measures are needed. This Government is committed to increasing the number of hate crimes brought to justice, tackling antisemitism on university campuses, and challenging hate crime and extremism on the internet.
> 
> ""We are working towards a fully integrated society in which everyone feels able to take part without fear of discrimination or attack.
> 
> ""Although we've taken some big steps forward today, there's no room for complacency. We will continue to take practical, effective action to stamp out antisemitism whenever and wherever it occurs.""

Jon Benjamin of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said:

> ""The Parliamentary Inquiry marked a watershed in the understanding of antisemitism as a real issue in Britain today, but was the beginning of a process that continues to this day. The ongoing work of the cross-departmental task force is hugely important in ensuring that the Inquiry's findings are addressed.""

Maintaining this momentum, Ministers will host a seminar in the spring to ensure continued progress on tackling hate crime including antisemitism on the internet.

To ensure the Holocaust is remembered, the Government has committed £750,000 for the 2011 commemoration and related educational activities and has pledged to fund the Lessons from Auschwitz Project (LfA) next year.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1615468,Communities minister celebrates equalities scheme,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell met with over 60 women from black and minority ethnic backgrounds yesterday, after they graduated from a ground-breaking mentoring scheme.

The BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) Women Councillor Mentoring Scheme aims to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds to engage with their council. Sixty women took part in the scheme and eight were so inspired that they stood for election in the 6 May poll, four of them winning seats.

He spoke alongside Lynne Featherstone, Equalities Minister, at an event on Monday 14 June organised by the Government Equalities Office (GEO) and Operation Black Vote (OBV).

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Good representation is the key to making public institutions responsive to the needs of the people they serve. The Big Society and Localism are both about inclusiveness and fairness, giving huge potential for women and ethnic minorities to influence decisions. The more we give power back to local bodies, the more important this gets.
> 
> ""Congratulations to all of the women who took part in the scheme. I'm looking forward to working with partners and Ministerial colleagues across government to push the race equality agenda forward and improve opportunities for people of all backgrounds.""

The Ministers met women who took part in the scheme, launched last year by OBV and the GEO. It paired BAME women with local councillors over a six month period, from October 2009 to March 2010.

The scheme gave participants first hand knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of councillors, serving officers and an insight into systems and procedures. The aim was that upon completion, the leadership programme would equip and motivate participants to engage in party politics.

As the lead department for race equality, Communities and Local Government has worked closely with the GEO to deliver this scheme.

Participants were also encouraged to become Community Ambassadors under the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE) scheme funded by GEO, explaining and promoting the benefits of civic engagement and encouraging others to also become involved in community affairs.

Lynne Featherstone, Minister for Equalities said:

> ""BAME women make up more than 5 per cent of the population but less than 1 per cent of councillors. Our democracy is supposed to be representative, rooted in the community. It won't be representative until more women like these are at the heart of decision making at a local and national level. We need all sections of society represented in politics so we can get decisions that can have a real effect on everyone.
> 
> ""These new Councillors do not just want change; they have put themselves forward to make change happen. They are role models for equality - bringing a voice to decision making that has been missing for too long.""

Francine Fernandes, OBV Head of Shadowing Schemes said:

> ""The women have blazed a trail of political success. Within a very short period of time, they have moved from political bystanders to political leaders. Their collective journeys and achievements starkly demonstrate the wealth of talent within BAME communities and defy stereotypes about women, and particularly BAME women. OBV are especially pleased that so many of the participants put themselves forward as candidates and are now local councillors. We celebrate their entrance into public life and commend the positive contributions which they are making to their local communities.""

### Notes to editors

1. The event took place in the House of Commons on Monday 14 June.

2. The cross-party BAME Women Councillors' Taskforce was set up to find practical ways to increase the numbers of Black, Asian and minority ethic (BAME) women councillors. The 60 participants of the mentoring shadowing scheme were selected nationally and party pairings were based on the preference of candidates. The four mentees who were recently elected as local councillors were as follows:

  * Cllr Judith Best , Liberal Democrat, Lambeth
  * Cllr Pathumal Ali, Liberal Democrat, Sutton
  * Cllr Margaret McLennan, Labour, Brent
  * Cllr Dr Sheila D'Souza, Conservative, Westminister

3. The Government Equalities Office funded the scheme and are responsible for the Government's overall strategy, legislation, and priorities on equality issues. [http://www.equalities.gov.uk/](http://www.equalities.gov.uk/)

4. Operation Black Vote is a non-party political campaign. The term ""Black"" is a political term. It refers to African, Asian, Caribbean and other ethnic minorities. [http://www.obv.org.uk/](http://www.obv.org.uk/)

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1716044,Communities minister celebrates ethnic minority achievement,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell yesterday celebrated the success of graduates in a pioneering scheme that helps people of all ethnic backgrounds achieve their potential.

He spoke at the graduation ceremony for participants in the First Steps and Black on Board programmes, both supported by Communities and Local Government, which offer training and support for people starting up social enterprises or looking to increase their influence in the local community.

Mr Stunell praised the scheme and outlined the Government's commitment to equalities and to building an 'opportunity society', in which barriers to social mobility are pulled down. The coalition agreement sets out a commitment to improve levels of enterprise in ethnic minority communities and offer internships to under­represented minorities in every Whitehall department.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Everyone, no matter what their background, should have the opportunity to rise as far as their talents will take them. This government wants to unlock the potential that's out there and enable people to succeed and to make a difference in their neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""All today's graduates are in their own way role models and will be powerful examples for young people from all ethnic communities and circumstances, as they encourage the next generation to aim high and demonstrate what can be achieved through talent, determination and commitment.
> 
> ""I congratulate all today's graduates and wish them every continued success.""

Black on Board provides training and mentoring for people from minority ethnic communities to help them achieve places on management boards in the housing, education and health sectors. The knowledge and skills that participants acquire enable them to get involved in improving their local area and play a more active part in the Big Society. Also run by Olmec, the First Steps scheme aims to boost ethnic minority involvement in starting up social enterprises - something the Government is keen to encourage as social enterprises and mutuals play an increasingly important role in service delivery in the coming years.

Today's event recognised the achievements of the 40 individuals, predominantly from minority ethnic backgrounds, who have completed these training programmes.

The event, took place at the Liverpool International Slavery Museum, to promote understanding of the slave trade and the consequences being felt today.

![Children at the Liverpool International Slavery Museum.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1695707)

Mr Stunell's speech emphasised the importance of addressing the challenges of modern day slavery, discrimination and disadvantage and the Government's commitment to tackling race inequality.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""Acceptance and understanding of our past is important in moving towards a future which is free of intolerance and racism.
> 
> ""The Government is committed to working to combat racial discrimination, as well as equality for all. We are also helping fight modern day slavery by addressing the root causes - poverty and inequality - in the developing world.""

Carnivals and performances are being held today in Bristol and London and will be followed by a programme of educational events throughout the year.

The Department for Communities and Local Government wants to break down the barriers that small voluntary and community organisations can face. The Minister will announce that workshops are to be held in the autumn which will help Black and Minority Ethnic-led organisations access funding for educational and heritage events (including those on the remembrance of slavery and the slave trade).

Speaking at the end of a day of discussions, workshops and presentations, Mr Stunell outlined the Government's commitments to equality of opportunity, tackling intolerance in all forms and to creating a stronger, better integrated society.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Chinese community here is the largest in Europe and contributes massively to the social, economic and cultural richness of Britain.
> 
> ""However, I know that some members of the community experience unacceptable racial discrimination or violence. There are also low levels of Chinese representation in politics.
> 
> ""Today has been a valuable opportunity to hear some the concerns of the community and to explore ways in which they can be tackled and resolved.""

Lord Wei also spoke at the event, outlining the role that all communities can play in helping to build the Big Society.

Workshops on topics including health, education and justice gave attendees a chance to explore the issues in more depth. Officials were on hand from a number of government departments to answer questions from the community.

Three presentations covering different issues faced by the Chinese community in the UK were given by the Chinese in Britain Forum, Min Quan and the BC Project.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1745483,Communities Minister urges faith groups to inspire community action,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell this week encouraged faith based organisations to share their passion and experience with others to maximise their work to help people and improve neighbourhoods.

In a major speech to representatives of groups involved with social action across the country, Mr Stunell stressed that faith based community action is a key plank of the Big Society vision. Faith based organisations are well-rooted in communities and have a long track record of successful work to address social needs. They are also able to stimulate volunteering and financial resources.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Faith based organisations have long made an important contribution to local communities, and your work is going to become even more relevant in the months to come. Practical co-operation between churches, mosques, temples, gurdwaras, synagogues and the wider voluntary sector can become a huge force for good in building the stronger communities that are at the heart of the Big Society's purpose.
> 
> ""There are some great examples of faith based providers that are thinking flexibly and reaching out beyond their own natural constituencies, whether of faith or of location. We want more organisations to follow this lead and take advantage of the emerging Big Society to make an even bigger difference in their communities.""

Making the keynote speech at the Faith Based Regeneration Network national conference in London on 19 October, Mr Stunell fleshed out the Government's Big Society plans and challenged those attending to consider how best they can harness the increasing power at the local level in order to address the needs of the neighbourhoods they operate in.

The Minister issued a number of challenges to those at the conference. He asked what Government can learn from faith based organisations and what barriers Government could dismantle that would make it easier for faith based organisations to achieve their goals.

Andrew Stunell updated delegates on work that's already taking place to foster the Big Society, including in the four 'vanguard areas'. These four places are receiving targeted Government support to help resolve the bureaucratic barriers that get in the way of locally driven community development.

The Minister went on to say that organisations and projects that bring people with different beliefs together are especially important in helping to build a stronger, more integrated society. Inter Faith Week next month will be an opportunity to celebrate and encourage inter faith dialogue and social action.

### Notes to editors

1. The Faith Based Regeneration Network (FbRN) describes itself as 'the leading multi faith network for community development, community regeneration and social action'.

It aims to build the skills and capacity for faith based social action, and to connect communities with policy makers.

2. Inter Faith Week is being led by the Inter Faith Network. The aims of Inter Faith Week are:

  * to strengthen good inter faith relations at all levels

  * to increase awareness of the different faith communities in the UK, in particular celebrating and building on the contribution that their members make to their neighbourhoods and to wider society

  * to increase understanding between people of religious and non-religious belief.

Inter Faith Week 2010 will run from 21-27 November in England and Wales. For more information go to [www.interfaithweek.org](http://www.interfaithweek.org.uk) (external link).

His visit was to see the essential conservation work being carried out by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation to preserve and maintain the former concentration camp as an important memorial to educate future generations of the tragedy of the Holocaust.![Communities Secretary Eric Pickles signing the visitor](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2051356)  
   
On his visit, the Secretary of State was joined by Piotr Cywinski, Director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Jacek Kastelaniec, General Director of the Foundation and who explained how worldwide contributions - including £2.1 million of British Government funding, primarily from the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - were helping to safeguard the remains of the camp and ensure its long-term preservation.

The memorial covers almost 200 hectares of grounds, 155 buildings, and 300 ruins, including the ruins of the gas chambers and crematoria, as well as a permanent exhibition of over 100 thousand personal items belonging to those murdered, archived documents, and the works of art made by prisoners.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said;

> ""Visiting Auschwitz has been a profound and moving experience. The buildings here are not just the historical remains of one of the darkest chapters in history. They go far beyond bricks and mortar. They are perpetual reminder of the pain and destructive force of hate.
> 
> ""It is our collective responsibility to ensure Auschwitz-Birkenau continues to stand as a centre of education, ensuring that the lessons of the Holocaust are taught today and to future generations. I have huge respect for the museum and the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation and its vital work in maintaining and restoring the memorial site.""

While in Krakow the Secretary of State also visited the Jewish Community Centre which was built and fully funded by the UK based international charity World Jewish Relief. 

Opened in April 2008, by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, the centre is now a focus for Krakow's Jewish Community to come together for social, educational and religious programmes. Following a meeting with the Centre's Director Jonathan Ornstein, Mr Pickles spent time with those who work, volunteer and benefit from the Centre. Among those he met were Zofia Radzikowska, a 76 year old Holocaust survivor studying Hebrew and Spanish who also visits the Senior Club every day.

Neighbourhood Planning will for the first time give communities a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area. Local people will be able to have their say on the location of new homes, the design of buildings, the shops they want to see in the High Street, and the green spaces that should be protected.

The new powers being introduced in the Localism Bill will also give local people the power to decide the types of development that can be granted automatic planning permission, through a Neighbourhood Development Order.

The regulations being published for consultation make clear how a neighbourhood area will be defined, how to set up the forums that will propose plans, and will also outline the requirements for establishing a Neighbourhood Development Order.

An easy to understand guide to Neighbourhood Planning is also being published today to make it easier for communities to use the new powers.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""For the first time local people will have a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area through Neighbourhood Planning.
> 
> ""Communities will be able to shape their own vision for the future as they see fit. They will be able to protect what makes their town or village special, including green spaces, and have their say on the design and location of new homes.
> 
> ""There has been real enthusiasm across the country to test out Neighbourhood Planning and today's consultation is the next step in preparing the ground before the powers become widely available.""

The regulations draw on existing procedures where possible to minimise the time communities and councils need to become familiar with the new system.

There are now 126 communities acting as 'frontrunners' for testing out the principles of Neighbourhood Planning. Applications are now being accepted for a fifth wave of frontrunners.

### Notes to editors

He described this dramatic new shift as ""an opportunity to change the future of the way public services are funded and be the thumping heart of your community"".

**Whole-Place:** The bids showed real ambition and radical thinking, setting out plans for more responsive local services, which are better designed and delivered. Six areas have been short-listed out of a list of fifteen areas that put their names forward to be one of two pilot areas for Whole-Place Community Budgets.

**Neighbourhood-level:** 24 areas have been shortlisted out of 45 areas that put their names forward to work with Whitehall to develop Neighbourhood-Level Community Budgets. The applications demonstrated the drive across communities and public services to explore new ways to give local people more control over their services.

The Community Budgets Prospectus was issued on 17 October 2011 inviting councils to submit expressions of interest to pilot Community Budgets across the whole of a local authority area and also at a neighbourhood level. Successful areas will be announced before the end of the year.

A list of the areas that submitted expressions of interest and those short listed is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2043280.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2043280.pdf).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1933560,Community budgets to be rolled out countrywide,"Up to 120 thousand families facing real social challenges will see a significant improvement in services with the roll out of Community Budgets across the country, the Deputy Prime Minister announced at the Local Government Association Conference today.

> Putting community budgets at the heart of how we deliver services

Community Budgets for families with multiple problems will create better public services by bringing together all local priorities and public money so agencies can find the right solutions to issues in their area in a new and co-ordinated way.

The Deputy Prime Minister invited councils to sign up for Community Budgets. Around fifty more authorities will get Community Budgets this year and then at least a further sixty in 2012-13. This follows the success of sixteen pioneer areas that have put in place plans to support the first 10,000 families.

These families are less than one per cent of the population, but are seen by as many as 20 different public and voluntary sector professionals at a cost of £4billion a year. A Salford family required 250 interventions in one year including 58 police call-outs and five arrests; five 999 visits to Accident and Emergency; two injunctions; and a Council Tax arrears summons. Their Community Budget led to the £200,000 cost being cut by two thirds.

The Deputy Prime Minister also announced that four new Community Budgets pilots will be launched to explore how communities can have greater control over services through a single budget from Whitehall, as part the Government's review into local government finances.

  * Two areas will be selected to help co-design **neighbourhood level Community Budgets** giving residents the opportunity to say what services they want, how they should work and whether they want to run them
  * Two areas will be selected to help co-design a **Community Budget** bringing all funding on local public services from the area into a single pot to test how to create the right local financial set up to deliver better services that people want.

A prospectus will be issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government at the end of the summer setting out the details for creating these single budget pilots.

The Deputy Prime Minister said:

> ""Every Government preaches localism. This Government will practice it. In terms of real decentralisation, money talks. We need to reverse decades of centralisation to make our communities masters of their own economic destinies. We have to create the conditions for communities to invest in their own success. That means putting our money where our mouth is to give local authorities proper power over spending as well as more control over the taxes raised and keep so, for example, they can fight to attract businesses to come to their area.

> ""We will also be putting community budgets at the heart of how we deliver services. There are families that have been let down by the system. Their complex problems mean they can end up seeing dozens of professionals across public services - but those professionals aren't always joined up, making it near impossible for anyone to get an overall picture of what that family needs. Community budgets are budgeting for real life, breaking down the barriers between different parts of the machine, and treating people with troubles like human beings, not figures on a spreadsheet.""

The Deputy Prime Minister also announced that the Department for Communities and Local Government will introduce a Local Government Finance Bill that will throw the Whitehall shackles off local government funding by giving councils the freedom to borrow against business rates, known as Tax Increment Financing, and to retain business rates.

The first phase of the Local Government Resource Review is considering options to enable councils to retain locally raised business rates. Real progress is being made and it is expected to report in the summer. A second phase set out today deals with Community Budgets.

Eric Pickles added:

> ""It makes no sense that 120,000 families cost the country £4billion because inefficient public services are duplicating work. Community Budgets will radically change that by giving local councils and communities control over how public money spent in their area is used.
> 
> ""We are extending the reach of Community Budgets so that more local services across the country work in partnership to knock back the bureaucratic processes that box them into working alone.""

Tim Loughton, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children said:

> ""This is a once in a life time opportunity for the most disadvantaged families in society. We know that a key worker providing well coordinated no nonsense support helps spur families to overcome even the most complex problems, get their children learning and into school and parents into work. This new programme will mean over half of local authorities in England will get help to make these changes this year.""

### Notes to editors

1. Community Budgets were announced as part of the Spending Review 2010 (see [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1748116](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1748116)) and the first 16 Community Budgets were launched by the 1st April (see [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1875618](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1875618)).

2. Detail of the Local Government Resource Review Terms of Reference (phase two: Community Budgets) published today are available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1933423.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1933423.pdf).

3. Detail of the Local Government Resource Review Terms of Reference (phase one: Business Rate retention) published on 17 March 2011 are available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1913801.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1913801.pdf).

4. The Government will be writing out to all Councils shortly setting out more detail about the national roll out of Community Budgets for families with multiple problems and the pilots of radical options.

Each Community Budget area will be offered support from voluntary and private sector experts in redesigning local services and using new and more effective ways to help families as well as deliver savings in local service costs. Further details are available at:  [www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/families/multipleproblems](http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/families/multipleproblems) .

5. Around 40-50,000 families experience multiple social, economic and health as well as serious child problems whilst a larger group, possible around 70,000 (making around 120,000 families in total) are at a much greater risk of developing these problems. The needs of these families (and the problems they can caused others) can be so great that up to 20 different professionals costing up to £250-£350,000 can be involved in trying to help them. Last December the Prime Minister announced that his ambition was to try to turn around the lives of the most troubled families by the end of this Parliament.

6. Nine centres or 'Dissemination Hubs' based within local authorities around the country will provide practical support to neighbouring areas in developing services for these families. Whitehall officials will be assigned to help areas 'bust' financial and legal barriers to achieving local ambitions by pooling budgets, changing working practices and investing in service reorganisation. Funding for local services for families will come from a wide range of local services all of whom stand to gain by reducing the demands many of these families make on their services. This includes Department for Education's £2.2bn a year Early Intervention Grant and Department for Work and Pensions £200m a year European Social Funding announced this month.

Support for areas will focus on promoting successful local practice. Family Intervention Projects and services pioneered by local authorities have been shown to deliver significant improvements in family outcomes and savings in a wide range of service costs for a fraction of this amount within 12 months. Department for Education funding for over 30 local authority and voluntary sector projects will help to build this evidence and develop new ways of working.

For example in Islington the Council, the NHS, Job Centre Plus, Probation, Police, housing and the voluntary sector is pooling staff and over £6m of resources for their Community Budget plan. This will allow them to give intensive support to families facing particular problems in the area. Half of the children in this borough live in poverty and the vast majority live in a household where no one works.

A new Family Outreach Support Service will support a thousand families with persistent problems. They will also look to prevent 9000 unemployed families from falling into crisis. The professionals are joining up the dots to give families early, coordinated support reducing the number of people and places they get support from.

7. The Department for Work & Pensions has also announced £200m of European Social Fund money over the next three years to help families with multiple problems overcome barriers to employment.

The European Social Fund is a European Union structural fund which aims to improve employment opportunities for workers in the internal market by complementing Member States' jobs and training policies. The new programme will be delivered by private and voluntary sector organisations working with local authorities. The provision will operate on a payment by results basis, with providers rewarded for helping move members of the families they are working with closer to a point where they are ready to apply for work and get a job. The aim will then be to help individuals in those families get into work directly, or through mainstream support such as the Government's new Work Programme.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1867783,Community refuse to call time on their local,"The Government's Localism Bill, which aims to take power from the centre and give it directly to communities, will enable people to have a much greater say on what happens in their area.

One aspect of the bill that will do this is the 'Community Right to Buy', which will make it easier for people to take over cherished local assets such as their village shop or their community centre, and save them from closure. It will do this by making sure community organisations have a fair chance to bid to take over assets and facilities that are important to them.

One community that is already showing others how to take care of their local assets is Hudswell village in North Yorkshire.

When their local pub 'The George and Dragon' closed three years ago and looked likely to remain empty, local residents got together to take action. Forming a cooperative, members sought local investment, and about 100 members of the community put up funds that enabled them to buy the pub.

After a period of refurbishment carried out by volunteers the pub was reopened, becoming a real centre of the community, offering the local populace more than just a range of ales.

### More than a pub

Martin Booth, Co-director of Hudswell Community Pub Ltd and one of the founder members of the cooperative explains it took a lot of work but the pub is doing 'alright', confounding the critics who said it would not work.

![embed: ](http://www.youtube.com/v/rVYk7KCiFjw?fs=1&hl=en_GB)

_A transcript of this video is available below._

The George and Dragon's garden is now the site for community allotments, the pub includes space for a small shop, a library as well as offering internet access and laptops available to rent out.

Talking about how the village has been affected by the Cooperative's efforts Martin Booth said;

> ""The village has really come together, the amount of community spirit that has been generated by the project is quite incredible.
> 
> ""It's more than a pub, it's a centre for village life, which is always what we wanted it to be.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1853203,Cornwall flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Cornwall has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government. The flag is being flown at this time to coincide with St Piran's Day, the patron saint of Cornwall, on 5 March.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

The Leader of Cornwall Council, Alec Robertson said:

> ""Cornwall is proud of its history. The natural landscape and our distinct Celtic language and culture have shaped the Cornwall of today. Our industrial mining past, when Cornwall was at the cutting edge of technological innovation, has left a world-wide legacy and Cornish Diasporas in many countries for whom Cornwall is still home. Occupying a central position in the Atlantic Arc, our maritime inheritance is still strong and our ports and harbours still house a fishing industry. In more recent times, Cornwall has become known for its visual and creative arts, of which we are justly proud.
> 
> ""The ancient flag of St Piran, Cornwall's patron saint, is an enduring symbol of this unique region. I am delighted that our proud flag is flying outside DCLG on St Piran's Day. It is a day that more and more people within the Cornish Diaspora are celebrating, and it is appropriate that DCLG, as the Government Department sponsoring the development of the Cornish language, is celebrating the day too.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

2. The Cornish flag has been kindly loaned by the Association of British Counties at no charge.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1639858,Council workers to help in radical plan to cut red tape,"A radical plan to banish nonsense red tape and repeal unnecessary laws was unveiled by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

![Eric Pickles and Andrew Stunell meet with local council workers.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/163394.jpg)Mr Pickles and his ministerial colleague Andrew Stunell made the announcement on a visit to Boscombe seafront. They met local council workers to ask them for their ideas for cutting back waste and making savings as part of a Government wide promise to ask people and the public sector for their ideas.

The Ministers also met local entrepreneurs and community champions that recently turned a car park and derelict buildings into a thriving area with modern beach huts, a shop and a restaurant - a great example of the Big Society in action.

> ""Up and down the country there are thousands of town hall workers and sector experts who want to make a real difference in their communities. But for far too long they have been tied up in needless bureaucracy that has been a burden on the important work they want to do.""

Piles of regulatory red tape are a traditional part of law making. But the Government has made it clear that it would shun the bureaucratic levers of the past imposed on councils and help encourage, local people to take control themselves.

Mr Pickles invited all council staff and sector experts to suggest CLG sponsored statutory guidance, secondary legislation or regulations they think should be removed so councils can get on with their job.

All 'Cut Red Tape' ideas will be considered. Send them to: [cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:%20cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk)

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Too much power has been sucked out of communities into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy.
> 
> ""More often than not over legislating simply lead to bureaucrats ticking extra sets of boxes on forms but none of the real changes that are needed. We need a sensible new approach that makes clear laws are intended to protect people, not overwhelm them with red tape.
> 
> ""Today I am asking councils to put localism into action and help us cut back red tape, wrest control away from the bureaucrats, reverse the years of creeping state control and return power to people, communities and councils.
> 
> ""Up and down the country there are thousands of town hall workers and sector experts who want to make a real difference in their communities. But for far too long they have been tied up in needless bureaucracy that has been a burden on the important work they want to do.""

### Minister publishes list of unnecessary red tape

Mr Pickles showed his commitment to the cause by publishing a list of unnecessary regulations, ridiculous micromanagement or outdated laws that he intend to revoke or simplify today. It included a 1919 law that requires the Secretary of State to approve councils wanting to buy new land for allotments; three different sets of regulation governing tree protection; and guidance on the duty to carry out an economic assessment (see download below).

The coalition programme for government committed to giving the public the opportunity to challenge the worst regulations and to introducing a 'one-in, one-out' rule whereby no new regulation is brought in without other regulation being cut by a greater amount. And 'sunset clauses' will ensure regulation is regularly reviewed.

The Deputy Prime Minister is spearheading the coalition's push to restore power to individuals creating a more open politics where the public are more engaged in Government where as many people as possible submit ideas for change.  The Government launched the 'Your Freedom' public debate and website last Thursday.

Councils are already welcoming the chance to reduce burdens with over 240 having coming forward already:

Nicholas True, Leader of Richmond upon Thames the Council said:

Mark Hall, CE Oadby and Wigston said:

> ""We welcome this approach and the chance to reduce administration burdens on LAs which will reduce costs, waste and improve customer service delivery.""

Martin Reeves, CE Coventry said:

> ""We really welcome this opportunity to give you our initial views and we are looking forward to working with you to remove layers of bureaucracy and inappropriate central government micro-management of local service delivery which is costly; inefficient and to return decision making back to local people"" 

Robert Knowles, Leader of Waverley Council said:

> ""Thank you for the opportunity you have given local authorities to suggest ways in which the new government can free-up local Councils from the excesses of top-down regulation and control that we have had to shoulder over recent years.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1638177,Councils and business pick up local enterprise partnerships baton,"Local businesses and councils are rallying to the Government's call to lead their economies, following the invitation to develop 'local enterprise partnerships'.

The coalition government is determined to drive growth and rebalance the economy. It has committed to replacing Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) with new local partnerships that will bring together councils and business on an equal footing.

### Working together key to driving economic growth

Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary recently called for local authorities and business leaders to submit proposals for local enterprise partnerships to help rebalance the country's fragile economy - without strangling business with red tape and regional quangos.

He said:

> ""We know that when councils and local business work hand in hand they can drive economic growth together and places can be transformed. Local enterprise partnerships are central to this vision which is why we are asking them what they need.""

### Locals support a local approach

The Government has asked local businesses and councils to develop their proposals ahead of a White Paper on Economic Growth to be published later in the summer. Ministers are determined to have a smooth transition from RDAs to local enterprise partnerships. RDAs have said they are committed to ensuring as smooth a transition as possible. That it is the work that matters, more than the institutional arrangements.

Angus Campbell, Leader of Dorset County Council said:

> ""The concept of local enterprise partnerships is sound and will enable logical groupings of Local Authorities to work together for the benefit of their Communities.""

Caroline Williams, Chief Executive of Norfolk Chamber of Commerce said:

> ""Having a more local focus is great for Norfolk.""

Opportunity Peterborough's Director of Economic Development Neil Darwin said:

> ""Peterborough is looking to ensure that it optimises the opportunity that new local enterprise partnerships present. We are keen to work with our neighbours to pursue this agenda. Irrespective of future structures the need to support local economic development remains paramount.""

Councillor Paul Watson, Chair of the Association of North East Councils said:

> ""The Association of North East Council and the Northern Business Forum are progressing with proposals to be put to Government on what local authority and business leaders consider will be in the best interests of the North East.""

Councillor Sean Woodward, Chairman of the Partnership for Urban South Hampshire (PUSH) said:

> ""The Partnership for Urban South Hampshire has a well established strategic framework within which businesses, local authorities, and other partners are already working together on issues of economic concern. Taking on the role of a local enterprise partnership offers a natural development of these arrangements and this invitation from Government will allow the partnership to take control of the economic destiny of their local area.""

Dermot Finch, Chief Executive of the Centre for Cities think tank, added:

> ""The ball is now in the court of local councils and businesses. They now need to come forward with their own plans for improving transport, housing, planning and enterprise.

Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson said:

> ""Local regeneration projects should be driven by local elected officials working together with businesses.""

North West Cambridgeshire MP Shailesh Vara said local enterprise partnerships would always be a better alternative to regional agencies.

He said:

> ""The RDAs have always been surplus to requirements, doing work which could be properly dealt with by other agencies.
> 
> ""It costs a huge amount of money which we will now be able to save in these tough economic times.
> 
> ""The RDAs should have been scrapped a long time ago, but it is better late than never.""

In a [joint letter](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1626854.pdf) (PDF, 84kb, 2 pages) sent to councils and business leaders today, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles have asked them to consider forming new local enterprise partnerships that can provide strategic leadership in their local areas and create the right environment for business success and economic growth.

Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary said:

> ""By giving up central control we will put democratic accountability back into the local economy making it responsive to the needs of local business and local people.""

> ""If you want to rebuild a fragile national economy you don't strangle business with red tape and let bloated regional quangos make all the decisions. Urgent action is needed to rebuild and rebalance local economies so that new businesses and economic opportunities spread across the country.
> 
> ""The solution needs to be local - we know that when councils and local business work hand in hand they can drive economic growth together and places can be transformed. Local enterprise partnerships are central to this vision which is why we are asking them what they need.
> 
> ""By giving up central control we will put democratic accountability back into the local economy making it responsive to the needs of local business and local people.""

Vince Cable, the Business Secretary added:

> ""We are determined to rebalance the economy towards the private sector, so it's important we create a more effective structure to drive economic growth and development across the country.
> 
> ""We want to a structure that reflects the real interest of enterprise and local councils - local enterprise partnerships will provide that vision and then take on the task of renewing local economies and tackling local barriers to growth. Today we are asking them to tell us about their vision and I'm looking forward to what they've got to say""

The Cabinet met today in Bradford, the Coalition's Cabinet's first ever meeting outside London to discuss how we can reopen Britain for business.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today confirmed a £1 billion Regional Growth Fund to help areas and communities at risk of being particularly affected by public spending cuts, saying that ""we want to create the conditions for growth and enterprise in the regions.""

The Government believes that business is the driver of economic growth and innovation, and that we need to take urgent action to boost enterprise, support green growth and build a new and more responsible economic model.

This focus on private enterprise will particularly help places that have been dependent on the public sector for too long. 

Further details of the Regional Growth Fund and the creation of local enterprise partnerships will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper on local and regional growth.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1838004,Councils are free to avoid charges for royal wedding street parties,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has welcomed the move to cut more Whitehall red tape to make it easier for communities to hold street parties to celebrate the Royal Wedding.

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond announced that he is writing to all local councils in England informing them that he is scrapping the Department for Transport guidance on road closures. The guidance - which was intended to cover all types of special event - was sometimes being misinterpreted by councils causing them to impose extra bureaucracy and costs on residents. This led to some communities being told they would need to employ traffic management companies to close off their road when holding even small street parties.

Now the guidance has been abolished, councils all over the country are free to avoid charges for street party road closures. These areas include much of London, such as Lambeth, Brent, Harrow and Barking and Dagenham, and also Bolton, Bucks, Kent, Liverpool, and Surrey.

The Secretary of State and Transport Minister want councils to use their discretion and ensure that they don't impose unnecessary burdens. This follows the announcement last summer when the Communities Secretary updated the Government's practical guide to organising street parties and fetes.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Whitehall has cut back the red tape which holds local community groups back and councils should now do their bit to support this national day of celebration.
> 
> ""This is as an opportunity for councils to help local residents from all backgrounds to come together, and reinforce our shared identity and sense of Britishness.""

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said:

> ""The Royal Wedding will be a day of celebration for communities up and down the country and street parties are a great way for people to get together and share this happy occasion.
> 
> ""In the past our guidance to councils on road closures has sometimes been misinterpreted and led to residents facing escalating costs and unnecessary bureaucracy.
> 
> ""I hope that withdrawing this guidance will make it easier for councils to let street parties go ahead and allow local communities to celebrate without being bogged down by paperwork.""

Chris Gittins, Director of the group Streets Alive said:

> ""Thanks to Eric Pickles and his efforts, the load of red tape on the residents has been lightened at last. Meanwhile, we will continue to work with residents to press councils to scrap even small charges and to rethink on the need for insurance for these great community spirit-building events.""

Streets Alive worked closely last August with the Communities Secretary when he wrote to all local authorities to reduce red tape for street parties. This guidance has steadily been taken up by most councils.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1802440,Councils' data demand overload radically reduced,"The volume of top-down information demanded by Whitehall is being radically reduced so councils can concentrate on delivering frontline services and keeping the public informed Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Councils will no longer have to spend money reporting to government or hitting targets on things like how people do the school run, how long the morning rush hour takes, whether people have 'access to nature', if people know how to complain; if migrants have taken English lessons; or whether people enjoy the arts.

A new single local government data list is being published today. Mr Pickles is now asking local government and members of the public to have their say on the proposed list of information required before finalising the list to apply from April 2011.

Instead of reporting to Whitehall bureaucrats, Ministers want to increase people power through more accountable and transparent councils - such as by opening up their books up to the scrutiny of local press, residents and armchair auditors. Councils are expected to publish online all spending data over £500 by January.

Departments across Whitehall have been abolishing an array of bureaucratic burdens and unjustified data demands. Comprehensive Area Assessments have ended; the £5m Place Survey stopped; 66 pages of guidance on how to report efficiency shredded; over 4,700 targets scrapped including adults doing sport, neighbourhood belonging and a self assessment on climate progress.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""For too long central Government has kept council staff hunched over desks crunching numbers and clipboard carriers asking the public intrusive questions so they can send reams of pointless paperwork back to Whitehall bean-counters - those days are over.

> ""Instead of being bombarded by Whitehall, with no structure or understanding of the reporting burdens, I want to free councils from the revolving door of red tape. By creating a comprehensive list, of the least amount of data needed, we can let councils get back to their day jobs of eliminating waste and delivering frontline services.
> 
> ""If the information is not on the agreed list, councils will not be obliged to provide it. We trust councils to get on with the job without big brother looming over their shoulder double checking every detail.""

In October Mr Pickles announced that as part of ending performance management of councils a single, comprehensive list of all the data local government would be created and that it would be subject to yearly reviews. If a request is made for data not on the list, councils would be under no obligation to collect and provide it.

The remaining information that central government requires from local government has been identified and put into the comprehensive list. Much of it is required for official statistics or in the public interest such as crime or house building figures, fire incidents and coastal erosion.

Ministers believe reducing red tape, which holds councils back, will free them to protect frontline services and focus spending on local priorities. The Government is committed to giving councils more freedoms and flexibilities.

### Notes to editors

1. The Local Government Association estimates councils' costs of complying with central government data requests as being £127m per annum (Delivering more for Less 2).

2. Comments on the list should be sent to [burdens@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:burdens@communities.gsi.gov.uk). The full list for consultation can be found at [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/tacklingburdens](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/tacklingburdens/), along with a webform to allow readers to comment easily on specific items.

3. The draft list published today sets out the data collections and surveys central government departments require from local government for 2011-12. We are also today publishing a more detailed breakdown of the data required by DCLG, and we will provide similar detail for other government departments and other government bodies' data requirements shortly.

4. So far we have identified 146 different data collections. But reducing data burdens is not simply about reducing this number. We believe that significant improvements can be made by streamlining how data is collected, reducing the size of some collections, and by councils themselves making data available to citizens, thereby reducing the need for central government to be involved. In an emergency situation government departments may still request information that isn't on the list.

5. Ministers are clear that the benefits of creating a single list are:

> a. For the first time, councils will have a clear list of what data they are expected to produce in a given year, allowing them to better manage their own resources and identify their own data needs.
> 
> b. Cataloguing the list as it stands is the first step to reducing the burden; without a comprehensive understanding of what is currently ask for, it is not possible to identify scope for reduce.
> 
> c. This will aid transparency, departments have been asked to give a reason for each data collection, to help draw out what central government is accountable for and where local government should be accountable to local people.
> 
> d. It will be easier for residents to find comparable data on local authorities using the single list, giving them a greater ability to hold central government and service providers to account.

6. The draft list will be available for comments, suggestions and development with the sector until 4 February. The final list will be published in time to take effect from April 2011. The list will be updated on a yearly basis.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1947298,Councils freed from begging bowl put on path to growth,"Councils will get to keep their own business rates under new local government financing proposals that will be fair and benefit those that grow financially, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The Government is today publishing proposals to allow the local retention of business rates by councils and to let them borrow against future rate income. Legislation will be set out later this year so changes start as soon as possible.

Today's consultation is the outcome of a review into local government funding that sought to repatriate rates; create a financial incentive for councils to promote local growth; reduce dependency upon central Government grant; and maintain protections for business and vulnerable areas.

The proposals will fundamentally shift councils away from their dependence on Government grant, where pleas of poverty earned a bigger share. Any council that grows it's business base would see increased business rates that they would keep. Importantly, there will be no change to the way business pays the tax, who is eligible for discount, or the way it is set nationally.

A system of new 'tariffs or top ups' would be put in place to ensure a fair starting point for all councils - north, south, metropolitan or district - by balancing out those with business rates income above a baseline funding level and those with income falling below it. A safety net levy on disproportionate gain will also provide extra protection where needed. The detailed mechanism will be set out later this year following consultation.

Ministers believe a new system is needed to end a long-standing problem where councils have no direct growth incentive, to build stronger relationships with business and to put councils in charge of their own financial circumstances.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ranked England's local government finance system as one of the most centralised in the world. With less than half of spending raised locally councils have less autonomy than Germany, Spain, Italy, USA, France or Japan. Last year £19 billion in business rates collected by councils was recovered by Government and redistributed back out through a complex grant.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Our proposals to repatriate business rate income are balanced, fair and equitable creating self-sufficiency, the right incentives for all areas to grow and protecting the most vulnerable places. This is what councils want and precisely what we mean by localism.
> 
> ""It will be much more straightforward, by letting councils keep the products of enterprise we will end their disparaging dependence on government handouts, finally start rewarding economic growth and support local firms and new jobs.
> 
> ""The top up and tariff measures will safeguard those places that have relied on grant by making sure successful areas share a slice of their income - from the offset no area will see less funding than they would have got under the old grant system.
> 
> ""Central redistribution weakened local accountability, gave councils no reason to promote business growth and meant local funding was dictated by bureaucratic formula not local need.""

A plain English guide to accompany the consultation has been produced. The core components of the proposed rate retention scheme are summarised as follows:

  * A baseline level with top ups and tariffs to create a fair starting point for all: Government would establish a baseline, which could be based on next year's Formula Grant allocations, for each council in the first year of the scheme (2013-14) so no council is worse off at the outset. Councils that collect more than that baseline would pay an individually set tariff to Government, while those below it would get an individually set top up grant from Government.
  * An incentive so all councils can grow: Tariffs and top up grants would remain fixed during future years meaning councils would retain any business rate growth it generates. Councils such as those in local enterprise partnerships, or districts and counties, will be allowed to voluntarily pool business rates to enable the wider economic area to benefit from growth and reduce any volatility.
  * A levy to recoup disproportionate gain: Government would create a levy to recoup a share of any disproportionate financial gain. It could vary according to each individual council's own circumstances and would be used to manage significant unforeseen falls in a council's business rates income.
  * A reset button to ensure stability: This will allow the Government to adjust top ups and tariffs to balance out changes in local circumstance. A longer period between resets, for example 10 years, would create a greater incentive effect, while a shorter one would allow frequent reassessment of budgets. This reset could be fixed or decided by Government.
  * No change for business: There will be no difference in the way business pay tax or the way the tax is set. Rate setting powers will remain under Central Government control and the revaluation process will stay unchanged. Rate relief to the needy will be unaffected. National discounts and rate relief will continue to be supported, meaning no adverse change to such groups as charities, amateur sports clubs, voluntary groups, those in hardship, and eligible rural or small firms.
  * Tax Increment Financing: This will allow councils to pay for future infrastructure developments by allowing them to borrow against projected rate growth. Councils are not currently permitted to retain their rates so cannot borrow against them. Rate retention would remove this barrier. The consultation sets out two options. An open structure that lets councils invest and take on the risks alone or one with stronger Government controls that guarantees revenue and disregards the levy or reset processes.

### Notes to editors

1. Spending Review funding levels for local authorities for 2013/14 and 2014/15 will remain the same. At the next Spending Review, the Government will review the total spending figures for local government with a view to more closely aligning local authority functions and responsibilities with business rates income from 2015/16.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1697386,Councils get power to decide how best to support service improvements,"A major new 'localism' proposal to cut red tape and hand over financial control of council service improvements and training to local government leaders was announced today by Communities and Local Government Minister Bob Neill.

Under new proposals, the Local Government Association (LGA) or a similar body will take control over how to use funding that gets redirected, or 'top-sliced', by Whitehall from the Revenue Support Grant (RSG) councils receive each year.

The LGA is to deliver greater openness and transparency. The LGA has from the 1st September committed to publish details of all future expenditure over £500. The LGA already seeks to abide by the principles of the Freedom of Information Act and the Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles recently called for them to be formally subject to the same FOI rules as central and local government.

At present Central Government directs the funding to be received by each of nine local government improvement organisations. In 2009-10 this 'top-slice' amounted to £45m.

In future, the total grant would be unringfenced and delegated to the designated local government body to allocate to funding programmes in the best way to improve council services, build strong local leadership, meet learning and development needs, and nurture robust local economies.

Ministers believe that removing the centrally-imposed restrictions on how funding is used will help to reduce overhead costs, red tape and waste in local improvement support, promoting better use of resources, better productivity and stronger local leadership.

Communities and Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Councils know best what they need to improve services and become more efficient - many are already leading the way in sharing backroom services and management structures, and improving procurement.
> 
> ""The LGA have called for this change, and have rightly taken steps to make their organisation more transparent so we can look at how to devolve this funding with confidence. By cutting the red tape around improvement funding councils can push even harder to make sure they have the tools and expertise to be fully focused on delivering frontline services that matter to people most and getting the best value for taxpayers' money.""

Baroness Margaret Eaton, Chairman of the Local Government Association, said:

> ""The purpose of the Local Government Group is to help councils serve local residents more effectively by carrying out national tasks on behalf of the whole sector. This very welcome localism initiative will focus effort on the achievement of key national outcomes, save money and ensure that resources are used in the most effective way possible. We are delighted that the government has responded so positively and creatively to this initiative"".

### Notes to editors

1. The level of 2010-11 RSG top-slice funding would be set following the 2010 Spending Review in October, but the LGA has suggested a 30 per cent reduction in return for the whole amount being paid to a single specified body.

2. The consultation asks whether the RSG top-slice funding should go to a sole specified local government body and whether that should be the LGA or LGID (formerly IDeA). Full details of the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/rsgtopsliceimprovementsconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/rsgtopsliceimprovementsconsult).

3. The eight bodies currently receiving RSG top-slice funding are:

  * Improvement and Development Agency, (IDEA) (known as Local Government Improvement and Development)

  * Employers' Organisation for Local Government (known as Local Government Employers)

  * Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services, (LACORS) (known as Local Government Regulation)

  * Public Private Partnerships Programme (4Ps)

  * Local Government International Bureau

  * National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales

  * National Institute of Adult Continuing Education

  * National Youth Agency.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2060993,Councils given the freedom to stop people playing the social housing system,"The sense of injustice associated with the system for social housing is finally coming to an end, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

Mr Shapps said new allocations guidance he published today for consultation will release councils and housing associations from the shackles of the current tick-box approach for allocating social homes.

The new freedoms will ensure councils and housing associations can reward achievement and encourage housing mobility - so scarce and precious social homes go to people who genuinely need and deserve them the most, such as hard working families and ex-servicemen and women.

At the same time, housing providers will be able to tackle the tenants who are able to work but do not take up opportunities for jobs.

Ministers believe that for too long there has been a sense of unfairness over who gets to live in social housing, with a common belief that tenancies only go to those who know how to play the system.

Several councils have already indicated they want to introduce a new flexible approach to manage allocations -Westminster, Southend and Manchester councils will prioritise those who show responsibility and make an effort to find work, and in Wandsworth those tenants on new flexible contracts who do not make an effort to find work will risk losing their tenancy.

Mr Shapps said untying the hands of councils and housing associations will make sure social housing once again becomes a springboard for success, instead of a final destination where aspirations are permanently put on hold.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps:

> ""For years the system for social housing has been associated with injustice - where rewards are reaped for those who know how to play the system the best. Despite this terrible image a lazy consensus in social housing has ensured that, for an entire generation, no one has bothered to do anything about it.
> 
> ""That's why I have today published new guidance for councils that will release them from the one-size-fits all approach and give them genuine freedom to ensure people benefit from living in a social home when they need it, for as long as they need it.
> 
> ""No longer will people who gain a council house be able to leave their aspiration and ambition at the door - instead, they will be helped to make a better life for themselves and their communities.
> 
> ""These changes will not only ensure more people benefit from the privilege of living in a social home, it will also restore pride to social housing, so a social tenancy is no longer seen as a stagnant option for life, but a launch pad to fulfil aspirations.""

The new powers will support councils who are already making plans to ensure social housing is used to reward people who are working or actively seeking work. Examples include:

  * Westminster - The council intends to reward those actively seeking work and discourage a 'benefits culture'. Households where the main applicant has been working under a written contract for at least two years will be given priority, and people who have been seeking work for the same period of time will be eligible for extra points if they have been engaged with the council's homelessness employment learning project. The aim is that by successfully housing these people they may be able to move out of council properties, freeing up more stock for other people who need it.

  * Southend - the council intends to put aside 20 per cent of its 6,200 homes for households in employment. The 'work plus' properties will incentivise and reward those in work and create more mixed communities.

  * Manchester - the council is starting to recognise employment status and community contribution in its allocations policy. Households on the waiting list who are working will be put in a higher priority band than they would otherwise have been.

  * Wandsworth - the council are proposing a pilot scheme called 'Housing into Work' where applicants who are unemployed, and of working age and physically capable of work, will be granted two-year tenancies on the condition that they find make every effort to find work or enroll on a training course.

The new guidance is part of radical reforms being introduced by the Government that will untie the hands of councils who in the past have been hamstrung into one course of action for all new tenants - to offer a home for life.

Instead of this one-size-fits-all approach, councils will have the freedom and flexibility to set the lengths of new tenancies, which take account and meet the needs of their tenants.

This key change will prioritise the vulnerable and lead to a fairer system. Landlords will be better placed to meet the needs of their new tenants - including through lifetime tenancies when appropriate - while the tenancies of their existing tenants will not be affected.

### Notes to editors

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1624341,Councils pledge to raise bar on procurement,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles co-chaired a meeting with Local Government Association (LGA) Chairman Dame Margaret Eaton to discuss how to help councils improve value for money and protect frontline services.

Following a tough but fair Budget, the meeting brought together key figures from local councils, central government, business and voluntary groups to discuss opportunities to enhance productivity through better procurement and collaborative working.

### New savings now

> ""Shining a light on spending will help to put savings before cuts... more can be done to enhance better value for money for hard-pressed local taxpayers""

This marks the start of a major programme to be lead by the LGA that will help identify ways councils can deliver better value for money for taxpayers. For example, by addressing the fragmentation of local government spending to secure further savings and encouraging more collaborative working.

Eric Pickles said of the project:

> ""I welcome the LGA's pledge to step up and lead a productivity programme so local government can find new savings now. Councils need to look at where every penny is going and what that money is delivering, finding new savings now and planning for better service in future.
> 
> ""Shining a light on spending will help to put savings before cuts. Councils have delivered significant efficiencies but there is still more that can be done to enhance better value for money for hard-pressed local taxpayers and to protect the front line services that so many rely on.""

Dame Margaret Eaton said:

> ""Councils are always looking for ways to work more efficiently and are best placed to see how savings can be made on the ground. Town halls have been delivering major savings for years and want to ensure that councils and the rest of the public sector can learn from the best performers.
> 
> ""We believe it is important to work with Government and others to make sure that we cut waste, red tape and bureaucracy throughout the public sector and ensure councils can carry on doing their vital work that touches every family and business in Britain.""

### Greater transparency and value for money

The project is another example of the Government's commitment to transparent value for money. The Secretary of State has already written to councils calling on them to conduct business openly and publish details of all spending over £500 online and in full.

The Secretary of State added:

> ""A renewed and concerted focus on better procurement, greater transparency and increased collaboration that puts the emphasis on productivity above processes can further reduce duplication and unnecessary costs.""

### Facts and figures

  * Public spending currently represents £11,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. A significant amount of this, £42bn, is spent by local government on outside contracts including everything from construction, IT, telecoms and catering.
  * Councils own and maintain a lot of assets. There are 470,000 civic buildings; over 50,000 vehicles including more than 6,000 bin lorries; 1.27m computers.
  * The National Audit Office found that in some cases there are huge differences in the prices parts of the public sector, including councils, are paying for goods and services.
  * The cost of toner cartridges can vary between authorities by up to 745 per cent.
  * The cost of envelopes varied between £2.04 and £9.13, and paper costs varied across councils from £6.84 to £14.79.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1740503,"Councils' red tape cut as 4,700 Whitehall targets slashed","Sweeping measures that will radically reduce bureaucratic reporting for councils were announced by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles ahead of the Government's Spending Review.

Ending the requirement to report back to central government will mean local authorities will be free to focus on protecting frontline services. Underlining his commitment to localism, Mr Pickles said that the years of Government micromanaging were over.

The abolition of centrally driven targets, known as Local Area Agreements, will instantly remove reporting on 4,700 Whitehall targets from councils' daily workloads. Instead, local areas will be in control of their own delivery targets, answering to residents.

In addition, National Indicators used to monitor council performance will be replaced with an agreed single list of Whitehall data requirements for local government. New transparency arrangements will make sure councils remain accountable to local people.

Mr Pickles reiterated that transparency, productivity and innovation must be the watchwords for council business from here on in.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Time and time again, I hear complaints from councils about how much of a burden the National Indicator set is. Not because measurement and targets are always a bad thing.
> 
> ""But national targets tend to mean that councils are constantly working on things which matter to Whitehall, regardless of what local residents think. I'd much rather councils were tackling local issues. The money being spent on form fillers and bean counters could be far better spent helping elderly people to stay in their homes.
> 
> ""So I'm scrapping the existing local area agreements. I'm handing over control of more than 4,700 targets to councils and their voters. To keep them or dump them as they see fit.
> 
> ""And instead of the National Indicator Set, and instead of every single department's endless demands that you measure this, that or the other, there's just going to be one list of every bit of data that Government needs.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1741015,Councils should recognise the valuable role of the voluntary sector,"Councils should make best use of the voluntary sector's ability to deliver effective and innovative local services when managing future budgets, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said in a speech today to local authority chief executives.

Mr Clark said there was an even greater need for the diversity, innovation and cost savings that voluntary and community groups can offer in a tougher economic climate, and councils should look for opportunities to strengthen ties with the sector.

Praising the contribution of the voluntary sector to education, tackling worklessness, the environment and social care, Mr Clark said voluntary and community groups should have the right to challenge councils to offer a better alternative if they can do things better or more cost effectively.

The upcoming Localism Bill will entrench this powerful new right for communities to challenge the status quo and open up opportunities for new ways to do things differently.

Mr Clark said the Government expects local authorities to devolve and empower people and to maintain strong links with the voluntary sector over the coming months. He stressed that central Government wasn't giving power to councils to then see it recentralised locally through a monopoly of local public services with voluntary and community groups - including charities, social enterprises, co-ops and housing trusts - pushed out.

Speaking at the SOLACE conference, Mr Clark said:

> ""The spending review will inevitably present councils with some tough choices in the town hall, but councils must resist any temptation to pull the drawbridge up on the voluntary sector. We expect councils to devolve and empower people and maintain strong links with voluntary and community groups.
> 
> ""Right now in a tight economic climate there is a greater need for the diversity and innovation voluntary and community groups can offer. Reinforcing monopolies of local services by retrenching into the town hall is not the way forward. Opening up more of councils' budgets to have it carried out by voluntary organisations can improve effectiveness, increase resilience and save costs.""

Mr Clark made it clear that the Government's mission to decentralise would introduce the idea of contestability - the right for communities to challenge councils to consider new ways of working.

In order for communities to be able to make real choices they needed the right to challenge the way things are being done - and to offer a better alternative.

The upcoming Localism Bill will include this powerful new right, giving communities with good ideas far greater freedom to implement their innovations, spawning imitations in other neighbourhoods when they work and sharing lessons when they don't.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2059194,Councils still have healthy reserves for 2012 to 2013,"One year into the Spending Review period, the latest figures show that due to good budget management the majority of councils have not yet had to dig deep into their £10 billion reserves.

Overall, English local authorities expect to be holding £10.8 billion in reserves on 31 March 2012. At the same time last year, their forecasts for 31 March 2011 totalled £11 billion.

All councils should keep sufficient sums of money in reserve so that they have a financial cushion to meet sudden unexpected costs.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""All told, councils still have over £10 billion held in reserve to fall back on.
> 
> ""Most councils have maintained significant reserves, which will give them room to manoeuvre on their finances in future years, and help them to support budgets, and deliver efficient local services.""

### Notes to editors

  1. The reserves figures are from the Revenue Budget (RA) returns for 2010-11 and 2011-12 provided by local authorities to the Department. The full list of council reserves is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2059155](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2059155)
  2. Determining the level and use of reserves is a matter for individual local authorities, taking into account local challenges and priorities. There is no prescriptive national guidance on the minimum or maximum level of reserves, either as an absolute amount or as a percentage of the budget.
  3. Reserves are either: a) earmarked, as a result of a policy decision by a local authority to use them for specific purposes (it should be noted that some earmarked reserves have to be set aside for specific purposes under statute); or b) unallocated, these reserves are part of a local authority's risk management process, which would be called upon in the event of unexpected costs and emergencies.
  4. A recent report by the Audit Commission found that this year the vast majority of councils have sound financial management and are strongly placed to manage funding reductions. Further, the Audit Commission found that, on average, single tier county councils held unallocated reserves equivalent to two-thirds of their grant reductions. District councils held unallocated reserves of twice the value of their reduction. If earmarked reserves were included, district reserves were six times the value of their reduction, and, for county councils, nearly three times.
  5. Source data for the councils' reserves table is from the Revenue Budget (RA) 2010-11 2011-12 as sent to DCLG by local authorities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1867177,Councils to get final performance reward grant,"The Government is honouring the final instalment of performance reward grants, Local Government Minister Bob Neill said today.

£150m will be shared between 81 local authorities for meeting past targets and in line with the Government's commitment to give councils more spending freedom the payments will be unringfenced so they can use it in the best way to protect frontline services.

The Government is ending the era of top-down central control. By cutting targets and driving more open transparent government local authorities will be accountable to the residents they serve rather than to central bureaucratic systems.

Performance reward grants were set up under the previous Government as a way of rewarding councils for meeting centrally set targets. In October 2010 the Government announced it would end the bureaucratic and complex framework including rewards grant, National Indictors and Local Area Agreements, which made councils accountable to Whitehall rather than local people.

As part of this the Government announced that performance reward grants would not be paid for 2008-2011 Local Area Agreements. The reward grant being paid today is for agreements made before June 2008 and is being paid at a 50 per cent reduction.

In making these payments in this way the Government has struck a balance between the urgent need to cut the national deficit and secure economic recovery, whilst also recognising the achievements of councils and their partners who have worked together for their area.

Bob Neill said:

> ""It is right that we give councils the money they expected from delivering previously held central target commitments, but a system that prescribes that their performance is judged by ticking bureaucratic boxes is outdated and facing the wrong way.
> 
> ""Councils should be focused on meeting the expectations of residents not on meeting bureaucratic targets to get extra funding. We trust local authorities enough to not micromanage every inch of the way - we want local government to be accountable to local people.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1969220,Councils to lead local path to growth boosting jobs and firms,"New detail published on radical rate retention plans

Letting councils keep their own business rates will put all parts of the country on a stronger path to economic growth, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today, as more detail of how fair new local government financing proposals will work were published.

The Government has published [eight technical papers](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/lgresourcereview/), exploring how councils would be allowed to keep locally generated business rates, enabling them to borrow against future rate income. Legislation will be introduced later this year to allow changes to start as soon as possible.

Under the new system 'tariffs or top ups' would be put in place to ensure a fair starting point for all councils - north or south, metropolitan or district. Top up grants will bring up funding levels so no council is worse off as a result of its business rates base at the outset of the scheme. And a levy will recover a share of any disproportionate gain, to fund a safety net for places in need of additional support. Those with business rates income above a baseline funding level would contribute a tariff payment to the system whilst those with income below the baseline would receive top-up funding.

There will be no change in the level of business rates nor in the way that they are paid. Local charities, voluntary groups and small businesses will continue to get the same reliefs from Government.

In the past, many councils have seen their business rates base grow without reward, because the money was sent to Government for redistribution as Formula Grant. The new scheme will enable councils to benefit from any increases in the total revenue from business rates, providing a direct financial incentive for local authorities to promote local economic growth.

Ministers are confident that the new proposals will boost local firms and local jobs as councils are put in charge of their own financial circumstances, and rewarded for building stronger relationships with business to strengthen the local economy.

Last year £19 billion in business rates collected by councils was recovered by Government and redistributed back out through a complex grant. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) called this one of the most centralised systems in the world.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Councils deserve to see their business rate income repatriated in a balanced, fair and equitable way. Our changes will mean they can strive for self-sufficiency and have their own means to support local jobs, growth and protect the most vulnerable places.
> 
> ""The new business rates system will be much more transparent and today we are setting out more of the detail of our proposals so councils all across the country can see the potential impacts and how they could benefit.
> 
> ""The top up and tariff measures will safeguard those places that have relied on Government grant by making sure those areas with more business rate income than they need share a slice of that income. Every area will be rewarded for supporting local firms and growth. This is what councils want and precisely what we mean by localism.""

### Notes to editors

1. The technical papers published today are:

  * _Establishing the Baseline_ - discusses the detailed issues and options for establishing individual authorities' baseline funding levels, against which to compare their baseline business rates and so calculate tariffs and top-ups;
  * _Measuring Business Rates_ - considers how an authority's business rates will be calculated;
  * _Non-Billing Authorities_ - considers the mechanisms through which ""non-billing"" authorities will be funded within the business rates retention system;
  * _Business Rates Administration_ - sets out how the business rate retention scheme will operate;
  * _Tariff, Top-Up and Levy Options_ - seeks views on the detailed options for setting tariffs and top ups, and for the operation of the levy and the safety net;
  * _Volatility_ - considers how, within the rates retention scheme, income volatility could be handled;
  * _Revaluation and Transition_ - sets how revaluation and transitional arrangements might work within a rate retention system; and
  * _Renewable Energy_ - sets out how the Government's commitment to allow communities hosting renewable energy projects will be able to keep the business rates generated from such projects; and
  * _An interactive calculator_ - to enable councils to make estimates of the main variables for their area, and to see the comparative impact of different approaches to scheme design.

2. The core components of the proposed rate retention scheme are summarised as follows:

  * A baseline funding level for each authority, based on their 2012-13 formula grant, from which top ups and tariffs would be derived to create a fair starting point for all and ensure no council is worse off in the first year of the scheme (2013-14) as a result of their business rates base. Councils with business rates in excess of their baseline funding level would pay an individually set tariff to Government, while those with less business rates would get an individually set top up grant from Government.
  * An incentive so all councils can benefit from growth: Tariffs and top up grants would remain fixed during future years, meaning councils would benefit from any business rate growth they generate. Councils such as those in local enterprise partnerships, or districts and counties, will be allowed to voluntarily pool business rates to enable the wider economic area to benefit from growth and reduce any volatility.
  * A levy to recoup disproportionate gain: Government would create a levy to recoup a share of any disproportionate financial gain. It could vary according to each individual council's own circumstances and would be used to fund a safety net to manage significant unforeseen falls in a council's business rates income, for example, a significant reduction in income as a result of a major local employer closing.
  * A reset button to ensure stability: This will allow the Government to adjust top ups and tariffs to balance out changes in local circumstance. A longer period between resets, for example 10 years, would create a greater incentive effect, while a shorter one would allow frequent reassessment of budgets. This reset could be fixed or decided by Government.
  * No change for business: There will be no difference in the way businesses pay tax or the way the tax is set. Rate setting powers will remain under Central Government control and the revaluation process will stay unchanged. Rate relief to the needy will be unaffected. National discounts and rate relief will continue to be supported, meaning no adverse change to such groups as charities, amateur sports clubs, voluntary groups, those in hardship, and eligible rural or small firms.
  * Tax Increment Financing: This will allow councils to pay for future infrastructure developments by allowing them to borrow against projected rate growth. Councils are not currently permitted to retain their rates so cannot borrow against them. Rates retention would remove this barrier.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1886026,Councils to publicise citizens' right to inspect town hall ledgers,"New transparency rules will require councils to publicise to the press and public the little-known rights to inspect councils' detailed financial accounts, ledgers and records. This is designed to increase scrutiny of councils' spending decisions by armchair auditors and local investigative journalists, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

Every year councils are required to open their accounting records for public inspection and challenge over a set time period. Yet the public often do not realise that these citizens' rights include checking not just the accounts but also ""all books, deeds, contracts, bills, vouchers and receipts related to them"". These rights allow the public to check any spending under the £500 online transparency threshold, and avoid the need to submit Freedom of Information Act requests.

Revised rules controlling local authority accounting and audit practice have been introduced reinforcing the importance of local transparency, audit openness and accountability. These inspection rights last for 20 working days, but the period differs for each local authority, resulting in a low take-up to date. So in addition to the existing requirement to notify the public of their rights through the local press, councils must now also highlight the opportunity on their website.

In a deregulatory move, changes will also reduce the financial bureaucracy and burdens imposed on the smallest local authorities, streamlining the audit process to make it easier for authorities to be accountable to their community.

Until now, any public body with a budget over £1m had to provide comprehensive accounting and audit details, which hit smaller authorities such as parish councils disproportionately. These budget thresholds have now risen to £6.5m, meaning that up to 100 smaller local bodies will immediately benefit from less burdensome audit requirements, reducing costs on reporting duties imposed by Whitehall.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""An open Government is vital for good democracy and that's why councils have to open their ledgers to the public - everyone has a right to know how their taxes are spent.
> 
> ""But it's not enough to just publish them quietly, armchair auditors and local journalists need to know exactly where to find that information and these new changes will make sure they are not just out in the open but under the spotlight too.
> 
> ""We have also cut the red tape for the smallest councils. For too long they have been hostage to the most complex demands from Whitehall, eating into time and resources they could have used to deliver for their community, whilst maintaining robust safeguards on the spending of public money.""

### Notes to editors

Case studies on the exercise of these rights can be found at: [www.orchardnews.com/casestudies.htm](http://www.orchardnews.com/casestudies.htm) (external link).

1. The revised Accounts and Audit (England) Regulations 2011 now include the following notification requirements:

  * the period during which the accounts and other documents will be available for inspection

  * the place at which, and the hours during which, they will be so available

  * the name and address of the auditor

  * the right to make objections at audit; and

  * the date appointed for the exercise of rights of electors.

As soon as reasonably possible after conclusion of an audit, a larger relevant body must give notice by advertisement and on its website stating that the audit has been concluded and that the statement of accounts is available for inspection by local government electors and including:

  * a statement of the rights conferred on local government electors
  * the address at which and the hours during which those rights may be exercised; and
  * details of where the statement of accounts can be found on the body's website

2. In addition the new rules raise the threshold below which a local body is classed as a smaller body from £1m to £6.5m annual income or expenditure. This is based on the definition of small companies in the Companies Act.

3. Changes to the regulations came into effect on 31 March 2011 meaning affected authorities can apply the changes to their 2010 - 2011 accounts due to be published shortly. The full regulations can be found at: [www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/817/contents/made](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/817/contents/made) (external link).

4. Any body which enjoys the freedoms given by the Prudential Capital Finance System is excluded from the smaller body category.

5. Smaller body status means that the body can prepare a simpler set of year end accounts, and is subject to a less demanding system of audit scrutiny. Those without websites are being encouraged to consider how else they can make their community more aware of their rights. Larger parish councils, internal drainage boards and joint committees of principal local authorities will be the main types of body affected by the change.

6. The procedure for councillors to approve the accounting statements of the larger bodies will also change to allow them sight of audit findings before they are asked to give their approval.

7. Enforcement of these regulations in the past has relied on audit review and civil law obligations, and this will continue in the future. Criminal sanctions have been removed, as they have not been invoked in recent years and since Coalition Ministers believe such criminal sanctions are disproportionate.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1699481,Councils urged to cut street clutter,"Councils will today be urged to get rid of unnecessary signs, railings and advertising hoardings in a bid to make streets tidier and less confusing for motorists and pedestrians.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Philip Hammond are concerned that the character of the country's urban spaces is being damaged and have written to councils leaders calling on them to reduce the number of signs and other 'street clutter'.

The Government believes that in some cases traffic signs and railings are installed by councils in the mistaken belief that they are legally required. However, although some signs are required by law, Government advice is that for signs to be most effective they should be kept to a minimum. To help councils do this the Department for Transport is reviewing traffic signs policy and new advice on how to reduce clutter will be published later this year.

Ministers want communities to inform local authorities of particularly bad examples of clutter as part of the Big Society in action. Organisations who promote good urban design like Civic Voice, Living Streets and fixmystreet.com are already helping people alert councils to examples of clutter and showing people how to carry out street audits.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Our streets are losing their English character. We are being overrun by scruffy signs, bossy bollards, patchwork paving and railed off roads wasting taxpayers' money that could be better spent on fixing potholes or keeping council tax down. We need to 'cut the clutter'.
> 
> ""Too many overly cautious townhall officials are citing safety regulations as the reason for cluttering up our streets with an obstacle course when the truth is very little is dictated by law. Common sense tells us uncluttered streets have a fresher, freer authentic feel, which are safer and easier to maintain.
> 
> ""Organisations like Civic Voice, Living Streets and fixmystreet can help councils provide a Big Society solution - local people carrying out street audits will bring power and character back to neighbourhoods.""

Philip Hammond said:

> ""We all know that some signs are necessary to make our roads safe and help traffic flow freely. But unnecessary street furniture is a waste of taxpayers' money and leaves our streets looking more like scrap yards than public spaces.
> 
> ""We have written to councils to remind them that it need not be this way - we don't need all this clutter confusing motorists, obstructing pedestrians and hindering those with disabilities who are trying to navigate our streets.
> 
> ""Empowered local communities working together with councils can bring an end to this blight on our national landscape.""

Salisbury is a beautiful Cathedral City, full of history and renowned architecture. However the Salisbury Civic Society concluded, after carrying out a survey of over 60 streets, that it has become cluttered over time markedly reducing its character. They found the city centre was littered with hundreds of bollards. For example one parking area for 53 cars had 63 bollards. They now have a comprehensive public realm strategy aimed at creating an attractive, safe, clean and green city.

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice, said:

> ""Too many streets are plagued with pointless clutter, blighting the local environment and people's lives. Civic Voice believes in streets we can all be proud of. Our Street Pride campaign gives people the power to make a difference.  With today's welcome backing from the Government we should reclaim our streets and see them cleared of clutter.""

In addition to reducing clutter, well designed streets can also help reduce accidents. Street clutter was removed from Kensington High Street, which has helped reduce accidents by up to 47 per cent. The revamp of Oxford Circus reduced street clutter and barriers and introduced a diagonal crossing to let pedestrians navigate one of London's busiest intersections faster.

Tony Armstrong, Chief Executive of Living Streets, said:

> ""It's about time action was taken on our cluttered streets. For too long have pedestrians had to struggle with unnecessary bollards, guard-railing and pointless signs. Community involvement, stronger guidance from central government and a coordinated approach from local councils are all crucial ingredients to rid our streets of unnecessary obstacles for pedestrians. Councils in particular should ensure that de-cluttering is prioritised and championed across all departments.
> 
> ""Through our own audits with local communities and councils, we have found that stripping back street clutter transforms our streets from trip hazards to enjoyable open spaces where people want to walk. We welcome this step towards cutting the clutter.""

The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment's (CABE) technical design expertise has helped councils and communities with practical advice on cutting clutter and creating the best public space.

### Notes to editors

1. Government advice is clear that ""the excessive or insensitive use of traffic signs and other street furniture has a negative impact on the success of the street as a place"" and that ""street signs are periodically audited with a view to identifying and removing unnecessary signs"" (Manual for Streets, Department for Transport, 2007 can be found at: [http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/manforstreets/](http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/manforstreets/) (exteranl link).)

2. Traffic signs, road markings, street furniture, advertising boards and other obstacles all contribute to street clutter. Many signs and lines are simply not needed, perhaps a legacy of earlier but obsolete schemes or unnecessary duplicates provided as part of a 'belt and braces' approach to design. Wherever possible, these should be identified, reviewed and removed on a regular basis as a cost-effective means of improving the streetscape. ('Traffic Management and Streetscape', DfT local transport note 1/08.)

3. 'Appropriate warning signs can greatly assist road safety. To be most effective, however, they should be used sparingly.' (Traffic Signs Manual [http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tss/tsmanual/](http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tss/tsmanual/) (external link).)

4. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) is available to support community groups and other bodies to ensure that buildings and public spaces are well-designed and managed. A range of case studies that communities and councils can draw on at can be found at [www.cabe.org.uk](http://cabe.org.uk) (external link).

5. Several organisations are also helping reduce street clutter including:

  * Civic Voice is the national charity for the civic movement. It makes places more attractive, enjoyable and distinctive and promotes civic pride. Street Pride is Civic Voice's national campaign supporting local action to help rid our streets of unnecessary clutter. At its heart is a street survey undertaken by local people to provide evidence for councils to take action. The local surveys are being combined to support a national call for action to create more streets we can be proud of. Civic Voice's Street Pride campaign toolkit and briefings can be downloaded here [http://www.civicvoice.org.uk/campaigns/street-pride/](http://www.civicvoice.org.uk/campaigns/street-pride/) (external link).
  * FixMyStreet is a site to help people report, view, or discuss local problems they've found, problems such as graffiti, fly tipping, broken paving slabs, or street lighting, to their local council by simply locating them on a map. It launched in early February 2007. The free site reports postings to the relevant council by email. The council can then resolve the problem the way they normally would. Alternatively, you can discuss the problem on the website with others at [www.fixmystreet.com](http://www.fixmystreet.com/) (external link), and then together lobby the council to fix it, or fix it directly yourselves.
  * Living Streets believes that streets should be designed with people in mind. Unnecessary street clutter and design can get in the way of people safely making their journey on foot. Fine out more at [www.livingstreets.org.uk/news/uk/-/stripping-back-street-clutter](http://www.livingstreets.org.uk/news/uk/-/stripping-back-street-clutter) (external link).

6. Other organisations with an interest in de-cluttering, all of which are involved in the DfT's Traffic Signs Policy Review, include English Heritage, the Campaign to Protect Rural England and the RAC Foundation for Motoring.

![Essex Flag flying alongside the Union Flag](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1713262.jpg)The Essex Flag flying alongside the Union Flag at CLG 

Mr Pickles has asked that flags representing the historic counties of England be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Each flag - including the Red Rose of Lancashire and the White Horse of Kent - will fly for a week at a time throughout the year, with the exception of a week when the European Union flag is required to be flown.

Mr Pickles today raised the first of these flags - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Following Essex, the county flags will be flown in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""English counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Celebrity astrologer and historian Russell Grant said:

> ""Our counties are over a thousand years old and are steeped in history. They give us a sense of identity, of community, and great pride in where we live. I am delighted that they are being recognised in this way.""

Peter Martin, Leader of Essex County Council said:

> ""It is a wonderful honour for the Essex flag to be the first raised at the Communities and Local Government headquarters. We are extremely proud of our cultural heritage and individual identity in Essex, and promoting strong local communities is one of our top priorities. I am delighted to see that the importance of English counties is being recognised in this way.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1860552,Coventry plays host to first local enterprise partnership summit,"Secretary of State Eric Pickles and Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark were in Coventry to hear first-hand from business leaders and local authorities about their shared ambitions for business growth.

The first ever local enterprise partnership summit brought together business and civic leaders from across the country to share and build upon the progress made by partnerships in driving forward growth in their communities and rebalancing the economy. The summit was held at the Ricoh Arena, one of the private sector Board members of the Coventry and Warwickshire local enterprise partnership who convened the event.

### A new approach to business

Mr Pickles and Mr Clark were at the event alongside Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister addressed around 90 public and private sector representatives from the 31 new local enterprise partnerships, with the Prime Minister emphasising there was a pro-business government that saw the partnerships playing a big part in the economic recovery.

The Prime Minister said:

> ""Local enterprise partnerships are fundamental to the growth agenda. We believe that local people and local business leaders know best what works in their area.""

Denys Shortt, entrepreneur and chair of both the event and Coventry and Warwickshire local enterprise partnership, was confident about what could be achieved by the new approach.

> ""I've been growing businesses for 16 years and never once had a person from the government ask me for my opinion. This is completely new and a fantastic approach. It says a huge amount for local enterprise partnerships that the Government have allowed business owners a voice at the highest level.
> 
> ""To be asked what businesses can do to help and what can the region do to grow is a great honour, and it's very exciting to be able to make a difference to the future.""

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Local enterprise partnerships now cover 90 per cent of the country and today's summit shows how important the voice of local councils, local business and civic leaders, will be as they take the reins of their local economies and move forward with their own plans to rebalance the national economy, promote local jobs and local prosperity.""

### Working together for growth

Local enterprise partnerships bring together local business and civic leaders, working to support their local economy. They operate within a geography that reflects natural economic areas and provide the vision, knowledge and strategic leadership needed to drive sustainable private sector growth and job creation in their area.

Hundreds of homes and businesses in several communities across the county were hit by the floods in November 2009. The 12 months since have been a time of rebuilding for Cumbria's residents and a strong sense of community spirit has prevailed.

Counties such as Cumbria play an important part in the nation's cultural heritage, and in recognition of this Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony earlier this year. Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order, to coincide with particular county days, or in Cumbria's case to mark significant calendar dates.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. It is fitting that this week's flag is Cumbria - whose communities showed such great resilience during last year's devastating floods. This sense of pride people have in where they live and a shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Cllr Eddie Martin, Leader of Cumbria County Council, said:

> ""Cumbria has forged a strong identity in its relatively brief 36-year history as a county. We've built a brand as a welcoming place of great beauty, where we have strong traditional values, a sense of pride in where we live, and are always willing to help one another out. Our strong sense of community has come to the fore in the last 12 months, when we have not only faced the worst floods on record, but have also seen the tragedy of the Derrick Bird shootings and the Keswick school bus crash. We are delighted that Cumbria's flag will be flying outside the Department for Communities and Local Government on this significant anniversary.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1636576,Cutting council paperwork,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has given councils the freedom to improve how they are run without holding expensive and extensive consultations.

Laws passed in 2007 mean that all councils have to choose whether to have a locally elected mayor or a council leader, but are required to consult their residents before any changes can be made. The Government has pledged to scrap the need for councils to change how they are run so they will no longer have to go through this process.

But until then, the Minister has written to all district councils - the only authorities left to make this decision - making it clear they have the freedom to take a light touch approach to the consultations, at minimal cost to council taxpayers. Councils could use a newspaper article, press release or their websites, to get local views.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The path to change is too often littered with hoops, hurdles, form filling and cost. I want us to cut out the paperwork and get on with making a difference.
> 
> ""Of course it is important that local people have a say over how their council is run. But as council taxpayers they will not expect their councils to spend a fortune trying to ask for their opinions.
> 
> ""That's why I want little public money spent on this, when it can be better used on improving the local services residents rely on - especially when we're all working to get the country out of this financial mess.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles wants to stem the flow of relentless form filling, high costs and red tape for organising summer street parties and fetes.

Extortionate, inconsistent costs and paperwork for road closures, risk assessments, and temporary event notices are barriers to community events. It can often take weeks and cost thousands of pounds for councils trying to process these applications, which can deter both councils and organisers from putting on events.

There are examples of local communities having to apply for up to five separate licences, pay up to £5000 for a temporary road closure and obtain insurance cover for £2million for a typical outdoor event.

![Image: A Big Lunch street party in full swing](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1621619)Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Summer fetes and street parties are a great British tradition that we risk losing to overbearing bureaucracy.
> 
> ""When it comes to putting on street parties, it's like a red tape tombola for organisers depending on which council is processing their application.
> 
> ""Of course we want people to be safe and sound but common sense has to prevail. People are being turned off getting involved due to a merry go round of forms, rules that differ from one council to the next, time and expense. It is time to get a grip, especially if we are to cultivate a sense of community, fix broken Britain and create the Big Society.""

### Barriers

There is often an inconsistent approach by councils who charge different fees and use a number of conflicting regulations, which can present barriers and confusion for small voluntary groups. Organisers can also find it tricky to get upfront advice on public liability insurance, and find out about hidden costs at the last minute.

Mr Pickles is working across government to agree a consistent approach for councils to follow. This will result in good practice guidance being set out for councils and more upfront transparency on what organisers need - whether it's public liability insurance, road closure notices or health and safety assessments.

For more details on the barriers, please see the accompanying press release.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1682229,Cutting red tape to give a green light for greener development,"The new Government is taking swift action to shorten and simplify environmental regulations so it is easier for developers to green-proof their building projects, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

Councils and businesses will benefit from a simpler system for assessing the impact of development on the local environment, and will avoid unnecessary repetition of work during the planning process for multi-stage projects, saving over £200m a year.

New proposals published for consultation today will revoke four sets of rules about Environmental Impact Assessments, and replace them with one streamlined and user-friendly set of regulations.

The complex guidance for carrying out assessments will also be scrapped and replaced so it is clear and concise, ensuring developers can easily measure and minimise any negative effects their projects will have on the environment.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I want it to be as easy as possible for councils and businesses to reduce any negative impact new development may have on the environment. That's why we're scrapping this Byzantine collection of regulations and replacing them with one simple and concise set of guidelines for environmental assessments.
> 
> ""It is not enough for regulations to have good intentions - they also need to be user-friendly. So we've acted quickly to ensure the environment can be protected, without overwhelming everyone with red tape.""

### Notes to editors

1. Communities and Local Government is today publishing a consultation on the consolidation and amendment of the EIA Regulations. The amendments will revoke and consolidate four previous Statutory Instruments (SIs). A copy of the consultation document can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/eiaregs2010consult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/eiaregs2010consult)

2. Proposals include removing 'gold plating' provisions for multi stage consents, which required assessments to be carried out at different stages of the planning process. The 1999 Circular on Environmental Impact Assessment will also be replaced next year with concise, web-based guidance.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1772397,DCLG begins top-level streamlining with two key appointments,"The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has announced key appointments to its new top structure, marking the first substantive moves to streamline the senior leadership of the organisation.

The two Directors General who will head the Department's new Localism and Neighbourhoods policy groups have today been named as David Prout and Richard McCarthy, who each already serve at this grade in DCLG.

Last week, Irene Lucas, Director-General for Local Government and Regeneration, announced her departure in March 2011 to pursue business interests.

A second Director General in the Department has announced his intention to leave the Civil Service. Joe Montgomery, currently Director General for Regions and Communities, will leave at the end of January 2011, to pursue a range of business interests in the field of sustainable urban development.

Because of these decisions, the two new appointments were made by the Permanent Secretary, Sir Bob Kerslake, without the need for a competition.

David Prout, currently Director General for Communities, will take on the new Localism group which includes Local Government, Fire, Communities and the Big Society. Richard McCarthy, currently Director General for Housing and Planning, will lead the Neighbourhoods group which includes both these policy areas and regeneration.

Joe Montgomery has been Director General since 2001, most recently leading on Thames Gateway, Olympics and the Government Office Network. Until his departure he will continue to lead the programme to close down the Government Offices, which DCLG is managing on behalf of all departments.

Joe Montgomery said:

> ""I am excited by DCLG's new agenda of localism, decentralisation and the Big Society. I feel, however, that it is time for me to make my own contribution to public service and the Big Society in new ways.
> 
> ""I continue to be a believer in all that DCLG stands for, and I have cherished the opportunity to play a meaningful and fulfilling role in the Civil Service over the last nine years.
> 
> ""I now look forward to new and stretching opportunities to address the challenge of delivering sustainable development in our towns and cities.""

Sir Bob Kerslake said:

> ""I have worked with Joe in different capacities for well over ten years. He has brought an immense amount of wisdom, skill and humanity to whatever he has done in the job and I wish him well in whatever he decides to do next.""

A third Director General role in the new top structure - with responsibility for Finance and Corporate Services - has not yet been filled, but recruitment to the post is expected to take place shortly.

A selection process is currently underway which will reduce the number of DCLG staff at the next most senior grade, Director, from 21 to 15. Confirmation of these appointments is expected before Christmas.

In the New Year, the Department's work and staff will re-group under the newly appointed Directors and Directors General.

Sir Bob Kerslake told staff on 22 October that up to 40 per cent of jobs in the Department might go. Under the Spending Review, administrative budgets for DCLG are to be cut by 33 per cent over the four years to 2014-15.

### Notes to editors

Joe Montgomery has been a Director General since joining the Department for Transport Local Government and the Regions to lead the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal in March 2001. Since then he has held lead responsibility for the Thames Gateway programme, the Government Offices and establishing the Department's role in supporting the work of regional ministers.

Before joining the Department, Joe was Executive Director for Regeneration at Lewisham Council in London. He has extensive experience of urban renewal from his work as Assistant Secretary to the Cadbury Trust; as Leader of the Government's Inner City Task Force (in Deptford); and as Chief Executive of one of the 'pathfinder' City Challenge urban regeneration companies.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1829208,Delivered direct to your door: advice to make your home greener,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today outlined plans for the new scheme that will enable homeowners and tenants to receive tailored advice about how to make their homes greener and save money, delivered direct to their door.

Companies offering services to upgrade homes through the Government's Green Deal will be able to access information about the energy efficiency of properties that have an Energy Performance Certificate, and deliver tailored advice to individual homes. Proposals published today set out how the system for accessing this information will work.

The Green Deal is the Government's new and radical way of making energy efficiency available to all, whether people own or rent their property. Green Deal providers will carry work to upgrade properties so they become warmer and cheaper to run. Homeowners and tenants will have the opportunity to save money - with all the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the saving on energy bills.

Ministers have taken steps to make sure that the use of this information is subject to the most rigorous safeguards, and protected by tough data protection rules. These restrictions will ensure that:

  * no information about the identity of the homeowner or tenants is available on the register, only details about the energy efficiency of the property;
  * companies do not keep any records about properties that do not take up the scheme, and cannot share or sell the information to other organisations; and
  * homeowners and tenants will be able to opt out of receiving information from Green Deal providers.

Any correspondence from providers will only be for the purpose of informing homeowners and tenants about the improvements they could make to the property, and will clearly state that information about the property's energy efficiency has come from the register. 

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""It's right that homeowners and tenants across the country are given the opportunity to make their homes warmer and cheaper to run. The Green Deal will lead to a revolution in energy efficiency of homes across the country - making the data available in this way will mean anyone with an Energy Performance Certificate for their home can choose to receive advice about how to make their home warmer and save money on energy bills. 
> 
> ""But I want to make sure that there is no compromise on personal privacy in the drive for greener homes. So any homeowners and tenants who don't want to be approached by Green Deal providers will be able to opt out - and organisations offering these services will be subject to the strictest safeguards. We will keep these proposals under constant review, and will include extra safeguards if necessary.""

The Government is also taking steps to improve the quality of information in Energy Performance Certificates, to ensure they become more effective as a tool for reducing the carbon footprint of Britain's buildings. Measures to improve their quality include:

  * new robust operating requirements for energy assessor Accreditation Schemes together with clearer and streamlined guidance to explain the requirements for energy assessors;
  * tougher rules to ensure that the quality Energy Performance Certificates are consistent, and energy assessors who produce the certificates adhere to the Government's prescribed standards;
  * independent auditing supported by a new, standardised methodology for auditing the quality of the certificates, Accreditation Schemes and energy assessors. Monthly audit reports will need to be sent to the Department for Communities and Local Government; and
  * revised disciplinary procedures have been introduced to clarify the sanctions that apply when Accreditation Schemes fall short of Government requirements. So standards are enforced in a fair and consistent manner.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1748494,Department for Communities and Local Government announces new top structure,"The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has identified the first senior posts to be lost following the reduction in the Department's operating budget announced on Wednesday in the Spending Review.

The number of director general posts will be cut from six to three, Departmental staff were told today.

Administrative budgets for DCLG are to be cut by 33 per cent over the four years to 2014-15.

The announcement came as the man who will shortly take over as the Department's most senior civil servant, Sir Bob Kerslake, briefed hundreds of DCLG staff on the implications of the Spending Review.

Sir Bob, who becomes Permanent Secretary at the Department on 1 November, also told staff of reductions at the next most senior grade, director: the current 21 directors will be reduced to 15 under the changes.

The new top team was not named. Instead, a process will take place between now and Christmas to select the directors general and directors who will fill the most senior posts under his leadership.

The structure of the Department will be simplified. Two of the director general roles will cover the policy areas of Localism (including Local Government, Fire, Communities and the Big Society) and Neighbourhoods (including Housing and Planning). The third director general will lead Finance and Corporate Services.

Sir Bob, who is the outgoing chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, signalled today that he intends to complete the restructure of the Department within two years.

He told staff that up to 40 per cent of jobs at the Department might go, and that the scale of the reductions made some compulsory redundancies unavoidable. However, he stressed that every effort would be made to minimise job losses on those terms, and that an initial voluntary redundancy scheme would shortly be offered to DCLG civil servants.

Sir Bob Kerslake told his audience:

> ""Our Department's role is altering significantly under the Government's localism agenda. We'll do more enabling and less intervening. We'll be a smaller department but stronger - and we will play a more strategic role, punching our weight in Whitehall.
> 
> ""We're streamlining at every level, and it starts at the top.
> 
> ""This is an opportunity to improve the way we work. It's my intention that we move at pace, making these changes in two years, to reduce the uncertainty for everyone.""

Under the plans shared with DCLG staff, reductions will occur in sequence through the Department, from the top down.

On Wednesday the Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles MP, wrote to staff emphasising that change in the Department would be managed in a fair and sensitive way, showing respect for the contribution civil servants had made.

Since the Coalition Government was formed in May 2010, the Department has taken decisive action to make its radical localism agenda a reality and free up councils, businesses and communities to deliver economic growth. Key achievements highlighted in the annual report include:

  * suspending Home Information Packs
  * reducing red tape for councils by cutting out unnecessary form filling
  * introducing a Localism Bill to Parliament to shift power away from central government to local communities
  * increasing transparency by publishing details of its spending on all items over £500, and working to ensure that nearly all principal local authorities in England are doing the same
  * announcing a crackdown on 'garden grabbing' as part of an overhaul and simplification of planning policy
  * simplifying guidance to help communities organise street parties and summer fetes, and urging councils to remove unnecessary street clutter
  * doubling small business rate relief.

A number of measures have also been introduced that take effect this financial year, including:

  * freezing council tax in all England's councils
  * launching the New Homes Bonus to reward local authorities that build more homes, supported by almost £1bn over the Spending Review period
  * committing £890m to the Regional Growth Fund over the Spending Review period
  * increasing value for money in the Mortgage Rescue Scheme and introducing a FirstBuy equity loan scheme to support first time buyers.

Communities Secretary of State Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Department for Communities and Local Government is leading a fundamental shift of power away from Whitehall to councils, communities and households across the nation. Since the Coalition Government was formed in May 2010, we have taken decisive action to make our radical localism agenda a reality and free up councils, businesses and communities to deliver economic growth.
> 
> ""By turning government upside down we will put businesses and councils back in charge of economic growth, town halls back in charge of local affairs and people back in charge of their lives.""

All this was set against the need to tackle the record budget deficit. The Department made savings of £780m in 2010-11 and worked with local authorities to deliver £1.166bn savings in planned spending whilst protecting frontline services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1646654,Department for fire safety puts its own house in order,"Government Ministers today revealed that they have taken swift action to tackle an enforcement notice issued by Communities and Local Government against itself for breaking fire safety rules. The Department is the lead government body for fire safety and the fire services.

In February 2010, the Department issued a 'Crown Enforcement Notice' against the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, John Denham, for breaking fire regulations in the department's HQ in Eland House, London. This followed a safety inspection in November 2009 by fire staff employed by the Department.

The fire safety inspector warned the then Secretary of State that:

  * a refurbishment of the atrium was dangerous and could 'lead to uncontrolled fire-spread throughout the building';
  * a 'fire risk assessment has not been adequately updated';
  * 'smoke vents for the clearing of smoke on each floor are not being properly maintained';
  * 'there is currently no cleaning regime of the extraction ducting serving the main kitchen within the ground floor restaurant';
  * fire marshals had not been appointed; and
  * the 'building is unable to support a phased evacuation' due to the atrium changes.

New Ministers have now implemented all of the recommendations made by the fire inspectors (sprinklers are on course to be installed), and the Crown Enforcement Notice has been signed off by the fire safety specialists.

Bob Neill, Minister for the Fire Services, said:

> ""Since learning of the Crown Enforcement Notice we inherited from the last administration, I have made it my priority to resolve this issue and practice what we preach. The new Government is committed to high standards of fire safety and we've now put our own house in order.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1854141,Department publishes even more spending online,"The Department for Communities and Local Government has today become the first Whitehall department to publish online details of corporate credit card expenditure.

Spend data published today for the department's 'Procurement Card' covers the period 12 May 2010 to 31 January 2011.The data will continue to be published on a month by month basis.

The move is the latest in an effort to drive forward a new era of transparency and openness in government.

Government Procurement Cards are issued to specific employees, in central Whitehall and some local authorities, as a way of buying in low value goods and services.

The Department has already committed to publishing details of all its spending over £500 online. Having urged local authorities to follow suit, all except a very small minority have now adopted a transparent approach.

Ministers believe the public, as taxpayers, should be able to scrutinise how their money is being spent as this will help root out waste, spot duplication and achieve better value for money.

The decision to publish procurement card data follows the review by Sir Philip Green which found that the Government had consistently failed to make the most of its scale, buying power and credit rating.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""We are continuing to break new ground on transparency. By shining a light on our own accounts and opening up another avenue for the public to see how their taxes are being spent. We are keeping our commitment to a new and more open government that is ready to root out waste and making the taxpayers' cash go further.
> 
> ""The data is already showing us where we could do things differently. There will always be room for improvement and opportunities to bear down on costs and get better deals.
> 
> ""Transparency must be the underlying principal behind everything councils do. The overwhelming majority are already publishing their spend data over £500 online and I urge them to ensure that they also publish their corporate credit card spend over £500. Opening up the books for public scrutiny can help save money in tough times and protect the frontline by cutting waste and unnecessary costs.""

This is why the Department for Communities and Local Government is today publishing its latest monthly departmental spending figures (April 2011).

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> 
> ""The Department is looking to councils to make savings in how they deliver services and to publish their spending details online so it's only right we do the same by opening up our books for public scrutiny.""

The Treasury requires that all central government departments publish monthly details of spending for transactions over £25,000 - this department has lowered its threshold and publishes its transactions over £500 in line with what it expects of councils. There are now seven Whitehall departments publishing their spending over £500.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in London.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

HM Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire William Tucker said:

> ""I am thrilled to hear that the Derbyshire flag will fly above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government alongside the Union Flag. Derbyshire is a beautiful county with a very rich heritage and there is a very deep sense of pride felt by all of its people.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1914462,Developing options for the most effective transfer of the audit commission,"Local councils were today updated on Government plans to secure a value for money transfer of the Audit Commission's in-house practice into the private sector, announced Local Government Minister Grant Shapps.

In August last year the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced plans to disband the Audit Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold their councils and other public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

Since then Ministers have been examining the most cost effective options for disbanding the Audit Commission, transferring audit into the private sector and allowing local authorities to appoint their own auditors. In a letter from the Department's Permanent Secretary today councils were told that Ministers' initial view is that the best value for money option is to outsource all the audits currently undertaken by the in-house practice to the private sector.

In order to ensure that progress can be maintained on the options, Ministers have asked the Audit Commission to begin substantive preparatory work for outsourcing the 2012/13 audits. The Commission has been asked to design a procurement process that allows a range of firms to bid, including the possibility of an in house bid which could form the basis of a new employee owned mutual.

If Ministers do choose to opt for outsourcing all the 2012/13 audits, this would mean the Commission would be radically reduced by the end of 2012, leaving a small residuary body overseeing the contracts until local public bodies are in a position to appoint their own auditors.

Mr Shapps said:

> ""This Government has set in train measures to radically scale back centrally driven, bureaucratic and costly inspection and auditing, saving council taxpayers money.
> 
> ""We are working closely with the Audit Commission on options to transfer the audit practice into the private sector. Our initial view is that outsourcing could prove the best value for money and we have asked the Commission to start work on paving the way for outsourcing the 2012/13 audits to keep this option open before we make a final decision.""
> 
> ""We are determined to make sure that councils and other local bodies' interests are fully taken into account in any transition.""

The work that the Audit Commission has been asked to undertake signals further progress towards disbanding the organisation. A final decision on the future of the in-house practice will be announced shortly.

The Government has already abolished CAA and the Commission's programme of inspections has ended. Proposals on the future local audit framework are currently also out for consultation: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localpublicauditconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localpublicauditconsult)

The consultation which, is due to close on 30 June 2011, sets out proposals on the new audit framework where: audit quality is regulated within a statutory framework, overseen by the National Audit Office and the accountancy profession and where local public bodies will be free to appoint their own external auditors with stringent safeguards for independence.

Following the close of that consultation, [and once the Communities and Local Government Select Committee's report of its inquiry on audit and the inspection of local authorities has reported], proposals will be published in a draft bill to allow full Parliamentary scrutiny. A final bill will then be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows.

### Notes to editors

The Department for Communities and Local Government's Permanent Secretary has written to the Chief Executives of all local authorities today to update them on latest stage of the plans to disband the Audit Commission. In the letter he makes clear that the Department will be working closely with local government throughout the transition and with the Commission on the options for transferring the work of the in-house audit practice into the private sector. A copy of the letter can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/bklocalauditletter](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/bklocalauditletter)

Should Ministers decide to pursue an outsourcing option many of the Commission's audit staff would transfer with their work to the private sector under TUPE terms. In line with previous practice, the Commission plan to allow for a significant period of consultation with local authorities prior to finalising appointments. Their procurement and consultation timetable means that appointments are likely to be finalised after April 2012 - by 1 September at the latest, which will be manageable as the focus of auditors work in the first half of the financial year is generally on the previous year's accounts.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1766195,Director-General announces intention to move on,"One of the most senior civil servants in the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) today announced her intention to step down from her post to pursue other career opportunities.

Irene Lucas, Director-General for Local Government and Regeneration, will leave the department next March. She has agreed to stay on until then to support new Permanent Secretary Sir Bob Kerslake in implementing the changes to the department's top structure announced following last month's Comprehensive Spending Review.

Irene, who joined DCLG in September 2009 and served as Acting Permanent Secretary from June until November 2010, informed Sir Bob of her plans before he makes the changes that will see the number of Director General posts reduced from six to three. After a career in local and recently central government spanning 34 years, she plans to pursue a number of business interests.

Irene Lucas said:

> ""I've had a fantastic year which has bridged two administrations and seen the formation of our first coalition government for generations. During that time, I've been fortunate to draw on the enormous support of colleagues in DCLG and across Whitehall as well as the network of friends and contacts in local government where I'm best known.
> 
> ""It was also a great privilege to act as the department's Permanent Secretary until Sir Bob's arrival at the start of this month. He has a deserved reputation for leading organisations through times of significant change and I'm looking forward to working alongside him over the next few months as we start the process of becoming a smaller but stronger department that will play a more strategic role and one able to punch its weight in Whitehall.""

Sir Bob Kerslake said:

> ""I will be very sorry to see Irene go and would have liked her to stay. However, I totally understand and respect her reasons for deciding this is the right time to move on. I am pleased that she has agreed to continue in her post until March.
> 
> ""Her contribution during her time here as Director-General and Acting Permanent Secretary has been immense and she has steered the department through a period of unprecedented change and structural reform while at the same time helping to deliver the incoming Government's ambitious localism programme. She will be very much missed but I wish her the very best as she embarks on the next phase of her career.""

### Notes to editors

Irene was Acting Permanent Secretary from June 2010 to October 2010 before the arrival of Sir Bob Kerslake as Permanent Secretary on 1 November 2010.

Irene joined the Department in September 2009. She has been responsible for Local Government Finance, Policy and Performance, and regeneration (including implementation of the sub-national review).

Prior to joining the Department, Irene was Chief Executive of South Tyneside Council from 2002. She has had a long and successful career in local government, spanning 34 years and a variety of local authorities. She is renowned for her passion for strengthening collaboration between central and local government.

Irene has held a number of public appointments including at the BBC and the Sports Council of England and has worked with the FA, Premier League, Department of Culture Media and Sport, and Sport England to redistribute television rights funding to grass roots soccer across the UK.

She was awarded a CBE in the 2008 New Years Honours List.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2047046,Do it your way: Deputy Prime Minister and Cities Minister launch new 'City Deals',"Cities can bid for £100 million ultra-fast broadband boost

Cities will be set free from the Whitehall leash to do things their way, under a dramatic shift in power, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced today at an Institue for Public Policy Research North event in Leeds.

England's largest cities - the economic powerhouses of our country - are being offered a menu of transformative new powers which the Government wants to explore as the basis of a series of bespoke 'City Deals'.

Government will free cities from Whitehall control in a number of areas, with the aim of stimulating growth. The first wave of deals will be with the eight largest cities and their surrounding Local Enterprise Partnerships.

As with any deal, cities will have to offer something in return for new powers and funding. For example, cities must guarantee that they can provide strong and accountable leadership, improve efficiency and outcomes, and be innovative in their approach.

The 'first wave' of City Deals will focus on the eight core cities and their Local Enterprise Partnerships. The Government will look to roll this process out to other cities in due course.

The Deputy Prime Minister is also asking cities to bid for a share of a £100 million capital investment pot for ambitious broadband infrastructure plans. In addition to the four national capitals, this fund will support up to six cities, who will be free to bid for a range of ambitious projects, including superfast broadband to strategic business areas and free public Wi-Fi.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said:

> ""Cities are the engines of economic growth. Whitehall should not be like an overbearing parent, throwing money at cities but refusing to let them stand on their own two feet. So we will have a bonfire of Whitehall controls to empower our cities to go for growth.
> 
> ""We need our cities to be economic, social and cultural magnets - places people aspire to live. Firstly, cities will have greater freedom to invest in growth. Secondly, having power over transport, housing, broadband. Finally, the power to boost skills and jobs.
> 
> ""Our cities have been straining at Whitehall's leash. They now have a once in a generation opportunity. I urge them to seize it and make it count.""

Cities Minister, Greg Clark, said:

> ""Our cities are engines of growth and crucial to economic recovery. We want to do everything possible to give cities the freedoms they need to meet their economic potential and get them firing on all cylinders.
> 
> ""City deals are a bold and ambitious new idea to put cities back in charge of their own economic destiny and to seize the opportunities for growth. They represent a fundamental shift in the way Whitehall works, the presumption being that powers should be handed down wherever cities make a convincing case.""

Financial benefits - cities will have greater freedom to invest in growth.

  * An end to the current system of bidding to Whitehall departments for different pots of cash for different things like roads and housing. Instead, cities could get one consolidated capital pot to direct as they see fit.

  * Giving local authorities the freedom to set lower business rates for certain types of company - for example, if one city wanted to attract more companies specialising in computer-assisted design, they could offer those companies a reduced business rate to boost the sector.

  * £1 billion boost to the Regional Growth Fund to create jobs. The Government will encourage cities to bid for this money to help clusters of businesses in their area - so one bid could help several small companies.

Skills and jobs - new ways for cities to boost jobs and apprenticeships.

  * Many small businesses find the system of taking on apprentices too daunting, so cities will set up City Apprenticeship Hubs. These hubs will do all the administration and paperwork needed for apprenticeships, so that employers don't have to. Apprentices will be placed with employers by the hub.
  * Improving the way services work together to make it easier for people to get back in to work. Instead of being passed from one service to another - from JobCentre Plus to town hall to careers advisor - all of that can be done under one roof where it makes sense to do so.  
Power over infrastructure - unlocking investments to improve transport, housing, broadband.
  * Currently transport projects can be delayed because cities have to jump through numerous Whitehall hoops. The Government wants to hand over the decision making to cities so they can press on with projects that will make the biggest difference. And the Government will want to look at ways of increasing local accountability for local public transport, building on models like Transport for London.
  * Cities will have greater control over regeneration funding and responsibilities taking on functions and spending currently held by the Homes and Communities Agency.
  * Cities can bid for a share in a £100 million capital investment pot to spend on ambitious broadband infrastructure projects. In addition to the four national capitals, up to six cities could benefit from this new investment. We expect bids to include a range of projects including: 
    * superfast broadband to strategic business areas
    * city-wide high-speed mobile connectivity (e.g. Wi-Fi); and
    * information and demand-building activities.

### Notes to editors

1. Cities facts:

The Core Cities are: Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham, Manchester and Sheffield. The eight core cities are the largest and most economically important English cities outside of London.

Cities account for 58 per cent of England's population and 61 per cent of its jobs. When their wider commuting areas are taken into account, this rises to 74 per cent of population and 78 per cent of jobs. Source: Data for 2008, from DCLG (2010) Updating the evidence base on English Cities. Data for cities relates to Primary Urban Areas; for hinterlands includes travel to work areas (TTWA).

2. The menu of options as part of the deal is not exhaustive and is intended to raise debate and stimulate debate to do things differently.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2049759,Don't let fire be an unwelcome guest this Christmas,"As statistics reveal that one in six fire deaths last year occurred in December, the Fire Kills campaign is reminding people that some of their favourite festive traditions such as cooking Christmas dinner, decorating the home and drinking alcohol could have the potential to leave Yuletide celebrations in ruin. 

The distractions of a crowded house and celebrations can often result in festive cooking being left unattended. And the added influence of alcohol means that it's even more important to stay alert while preparing the turkey dinner. Nearly 1,400 house fires were started by cooking appliances last December, resulting in more than 300 injuries.

And while no Christmas party would be complete without a few decorations, the fact is that dry Christmas trees, flammable decorations and stray wrapping paper can all act as extra fuel for a fire sparked by overheated sockets, faulty fairy lights, unattended candles or carelessly discarded cigarettes.

A recent survey by fire-safe insulation manufacturer Rockwool revealed that a surprising number of people admit to leaving their Christmas tree lights plugged in when they're out of the house and leaving candles unattended in their home.

A Christmas video from the Fire Kills campaign shows in graphic detail just how fast a fire caused by faulty decorations can take hold and emphasises the vital importance of planning an escape route. Make sure your guests know how to get out, stay out and call 999.

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""The hustle and bustle of Christmas preparations can often push fire safety out of our minds. But in reality, the start of festive celebrations bring a whole cocktail of fire risks into the home - from the distractions of a crowded house while cooking and the slower reaction times that result from alcohol consumption, to the potential dangers of overloaded plug sockets, flammable decorations and unattended candles.
> 
> ""Christmas is a time for celebrating with family and friends, and we want to keep it that way. By being aware of the risks and making a few simple checks you can ensure that you and your loved ones can celebrate in safety.""

The Fire Kills Campaign have some top tips to help people celebrate in safety this festive season:

  * Ensure you have a working smoke alarm installed on all levels of your home. A working alarm can give you the vital time needed to escape in a fire. Test your smoke alarms weekly and never remove batteries to power presents!

  * Check on older relatives and neighbours this Christmas to ensure their safety as they are at greater risk from fire.

  * Never leave cooking unattended. The majority of fires start in the kitchen so this is a high risk area. Avoid cooking whilst drunk and always turn off kitchen appliances when you have finished cooking.

  * Never leave candles unattended. Keep candles out of the reach of children, and away from decorations, cards and wrapping paper, fires, lights and heaters.

  * Put your cigarette out, right out. Make sure your cigarette is fully extinguished and take care when drunk or tired. It's very easy to fall asleep while your cigarette is still burning and set furniture alight.

  * Don't overload sockets - ensure only one plug per socket. Always turn off plugs when they are not in use, except those that are designed to be left on, like freezers.

  * Ensure you switch off fairy lights and unplug them before you go to bed, or leave the house. Check your Christmas tree lights conform to the British Standard (BS EN 60598).

  * Always use an RCD (residual current device) on outdoor electrical equipment. This safety device - which works in a similar way to a circuit breaker - can save lives by instantly switching off the power if there is a fault and can be found in any DIY store.
  * Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do in a fire - in the event of fire: get out, stay out and call 999

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1634337,Don't waste money on excessive consultation says Shapps,"The new Government has today stripped away another layer of costly red tape by freeing councils to improve how they are run without holding expensive local talking shops.

Laws passed in 2007 mean that all councils have to choose whether to have a locally elected mayor or a council leader, but are required to consult their residents before any changes can be made. District councils are the only ones yet to make this decision.

The Government has pledged to scrap the need for councils to change how they are run so they will no longer have to go through this costly and time-consuming process.

But before that can happen, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today [written](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/letterconsultationrequirements) to all these councils, highlighting their freedom to take a light touch approach to the consultations, at minimal cost to council taxpayers.

Councils could choose to hold expensive talking shops - or they could use a newspaper article, press release, or their website, to get local views.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The path to change is too often littered with hoops and hurdles, form filling and cost. I want us to cut out the paperwork and get on with making a difference.
> 
> ""Of course it is important that local people have a say over how their council is run. But as council taxpayers they will not expect their councils to spend a fortune trying to ask for their opinions.
> 
> ""That's why I want little public money spent on this, when it can be better used on improving the local services residents rely on - especially when we're all working to get the country out of this financial mess.""

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended last month by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors.  This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Angus Campbell, Leader of Dorset County Council said:

> ""Dorset is an ancient County with a proud historical heritage. Its history is written across its landscape and along the beautiful Jurassic Coast and it is no surprise that Dorset folk have a distinctive pride in their identity and an instinctive love for their County.
> 
> ""I am proud that the Dorset flag is being flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government. It symbolises the important working connection between the Department and the historic counties of England.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

David Cameron was in attendance along with Cabinet ministers including Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Home Secretary Theresa May, as well as Head of Troubled Families Policy Louise Casey.

Welcoming guests to Number 10 the Prime Minister expressed his ""passion"" for the project which is turning around the lives of the 120,000 most challenging families in England in the next three years.

The reception came on the day that the Department for Communities and Local Government launched its unique payment by results programme that will reward upper tier local authorities with up to £4,000 per family if they get children off the streets and into school; reduce youth crime and antisocial behaviour; and put parents on a path back to work.![David Cameron meets with local authority leaders and community workers at a reception at No10 to mark the start of troubled families initiative.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2121413)

The 10 authorities with the largest amount of troubled families, amounting to a fifth of those that are being targeted, are all signed up to the £448 million scheme and ready to begin work in the new financial year with many more expected in the coming months. All 152 top-tier council chief executives were invited to the event along with new Troubled Families Co-ordinators and frontline workers from the public and voluntary sectors.

The Prime Minister told guests that:

> ""It's great to have so many people here from local government and so many people from different organisations and institutes that care about families. Today we're celebrating a step forward in the programme of trying to deal with the most troubled families, and that is producing the payment by results model to make money available for local authorities.
> 
> ""We all know there are some deeply troubled families in our country who are responsible for a huge amount of social problems, for themselves but also for the wider community - the children aren't going to school, the parents aren't in work, they are responsible for a huge amount of crime and antisocial behaviour, and they are deeply, deeply chaotic.
> 
> ""I am very proud of the fact that this Government has decided to roll up its sleeves and really try and deal with these problems, it's a hugely important area of work.""

Also speaking at the event, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles added that:

> ""We've brought the Government together, but the most important thing is this: that we all in this room - whether you're a politician, a chief executive, somebody from a charity - we have a real chance of turning these lives around.
> 
> ""We talk about the money its costing, but it is a human waste. People on a system that's leading nowhere, and we've got a chance to make a difference, and I am very much looking forward to working with all of you in the months to come.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1951731,Dramatic simplification of planning guidance to encourage sustainable growth,"A new, simpler framework for the planning system that safeguards the environment while meeting the need for sustainable growth has been published for consultation today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.

National planning policy, which is the basis for every local plan and decision, has accumulated to over one thousand pages during the last decade. Its volume and complexity have made planning increasingly inaccessible to all but specialists.

The Government in the Coalition Agreement committed to turning this thicket of national planning policy into a clear, tightly focused document, setting out national priorities and rules.

Today Ministers are inviting views on the draft _National Planning Policy Framework_ - which streamlines national policy from over 1,000 pages to just 52 pages of policy - as part of a consultation to get the planning system right for current and future generations. The draft Framework draws on responses to an initial call for evidence earlier in the year. The Government intends to consult on simplifying other guidance on national policy as the next step.

Underpinning the draft Framework are powerful protections for communities to safeguard the natural and historic environment. It maintains the Government's commitment to protecting the green belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest; facilitates a new generation of renewable energy projects; paves the way for green transport of the future - the electric car - by encouraging decision makers to provide charging points; re-affirms protections for our nation's historic and cultural heritage, and for our wildlife and bio-diversity, including new protection for peat bogs; and helps tackle the light pollution affecting the beauty of the night sky.

In addition, the draft Framework delivers on the Government's commitment in the _Natural Environment White Paper_ to allow communities to earmark important local green spaces for special protection - whether its value is in its natural beauty, its historical resonances, its recreational value, its tranquillity or its richness in wildlife.

The draft Framework also underlines the need for councils to work closely with communities and businesses and actively seek opportunities for sustainable growth to rebuild the economy; helping to deliver the homes, jobs, and infrastructure needed for a growing population whilst protecting the environment. A presumption in favour of sustainable development means that proposals should be approved promptly unless they would compromise the key sustainable development principles set out in the draft Framework.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Clarity in planning has become lost in translation. National planning policy and central government guidance has become so bloated that it now contains more words than the complete works of Shakespeare, making it impenetrable to ordinary people.
> 
> ""We need a simpler, swifter system that is easier to understand and where you don't need to pay for a lawyer to navigate your way around. That's why we promised reform to make planning easier to understand and easier to use for everyone.
> 
> ""Today's proposals set out national planning policy more concisely, and in doing so make clearer the importance of planning to safeguarding our extraordinary environment and meeting the needs of communities, now and in the future.
> 
> ""We now want to hear the thoughts of councils, communities and businesses on the draft Framework and work together to get the planning system right for generations to come.""

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:

> ""Our Natural Environment White Paper set out how we will not only continue to protect our countryside and green spaces, but improve them. This new planning framework will help make this a reality. It will give local communities the power to protect green spaces that mean so much to them, while still giving the highest protection to our treasured landscapes such as national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It will also ensure that development needed to grow the economy is carried out in a sustainable way.""

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

> ""Strong, sustainable growth is the Government's top priority. The new proposals published today, a key element of the plan for growth, set out plans that are responsive to business whilst protecting the concerns of communities and their environment.
> 
> ""Along with the powerful presumption for sustainable development, the new approach to planning will be a significant step forward in creating the right conditions for businesses to start up, invest, grow and create jobs.""

The draft Framework requires that development is carried out in a sustainable way. Sustainable development is that which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is central to the economic, environmental and social success of the country and is the core principle underpinning planning. Simply stated, the principle, as established by the Brundtland Commission in 1987, recognises the importance of ensuring that all people should be able to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life, both now and in the future.

Chair of the Major Developers Group, Sir Stuart Lipton said:

> ""We are delighted with the results of the proposals in the Framework as concepts. We have for years suggested that the planning system, with its accumulation of layers of directives and strategies needed radical reform. We support the strategies of the Framework which we feel will provide a more effective planning system. It will have regard for a balance of the interests of the community, the environment and the growth agenda.""

Chairman of National Association of Local Councils, Michael Carter said:

> ""The National Association is delighted that the overarching aim of the document is to empower communities, including very local parish and town councils, to shape the areas in which they live. We agree that they should have a major say in where housing, and other types of sustainable development, should go. The National Association believes that this is vital for sustainable economic growth in England. We welcome the fact that local communities will have the power to set their own standards that will meet the needs of local circumstances.""

Head of external affairs at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Stephen Thornton, said:

> ""The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors welcomes the Government's draft National Planning Policy Framework as a significant step forward in unlocking the planning system to deliver the growth required by UK Plc. We are pleased to see this concise outline of national planning policy at a strategic level rather than the thousands of pages of guidance that currently lose the thrust of what the Government is trying to achieve.""

Chief Executive of the Institute of Archaeologists, Peter Hinton said:

> ""The Framework sets out clearly Government's twin objectives of conserving the historic environment in a sustainable manner and of ensuring wide public benefit from expert investigations of those elements affected by development. We look forward to continuing to work with government in the coming weeks to make sure that the key heritage messages of the framework can be fully understood and implemented by heritage and property professionals, by local government, and by the communities they all serve.""

Director of Policy and Strategy of London First, John Dickie said:

> ""London First welcomes the publication of the draft National Planning Policy Framework which we believe will encourage growth and investment by consolidating planning guidance into a clear and concise document. Ending pages and pages of overlapping guidance and circulars has to be right. The draft Framework published today also signals the Government's continued commitment to liberalise the planning system which we strongly support.""

Chief executive of the British Property Federation Liz Peace, said:

> ""Planning policy should be streamlined, succinct and to the point if it is to deliver the growth and sustainable development that this country needs.
> 
> ""We understand that the new draft Framework follows closely the version submitted by the Practitioners Advisory Group which fully incorporated these principles. On that basis we will have no problem in giving today's Framework our ringing endorsement.""

Member of the Practitioners Advisory Group John Rhodes said:

> ""Most people involved in the planning industry recognise that it has become too complex and bureaucratic - and that it has lost sight of its principal purpose, which should be to deliver the homes, jobs and great places the country needs in an environmentally responsible way. The draft framework takes the opportunity to do something about that by making a real contribution to economic recovery and environmental objectives.""

Mr Neill met with over 350 students aged 14 to 16, from three local schools in Waltham Forest, Tower Hamlets and Hackney who believe they have the ideas and skills to become regeneration ambassadors for their area.

The competition event was part of the 'Make it our Future' project, an Olympic Legacy youth project which aims to harness the energy and ideas of young people to leave a lasting legacy for their community. Students look at community, regeneration and local democracy to enable them to develop ideas for how the Olympic park could be used to benefit the community.

Mr Neill chaired the judging panel with each class of students presenting their aspirations and business plans for regenerating the area. United from Lammas Sports and Technology College, Waltham Forest came top of the schools, winning the competition. The judges felt their idea of a two day community festival celebrating cultures stood out from the other teams. The student ambassadors now have the task of sharing their findings with siblings, friends and the community.

Mr Neill said:

> ""It has been a really great opportunity to see the excitement and enthusiasm of young people in East London to get involved in the Olympics, not just as a sporting event but as a regeneration project and a legacy for prosperity and growth.
> 
> ""The ideas and appetite of the young people here to have their voices heard and be engaged in the regeneration of their area just goes to show how much people can bring to the development of their communities when given the opportunity.
> 
> ""It's local people who know their area best, not Whitehall, and it is their input that will transform paper plans, plots of land and piles of bricks into vibrant communities which people want to be part of.""

The event was organised by Citizenship foundation, in partnership with Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) and Westfield Stratford City, who look to encourage young people to discover more about potential regeneration in their neighbourhood and engage with the plans for the future of Stratford City.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2073781,Election date announced for cities that say 'yes' to mayors,"The Government's commitment to people power and local democracy took another step forward today as Cities Minister Greg Clark announced the date for mayoral elections.  
   
Ballot boxes in the cities that say 'yes' to mayors will open on 15 November 2012, giving local people the power to decide who their first mayor should be.

In May 2010, the Coalition set out its commitment to creating directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Referendums will take place on 3 May 2012 in 11 cities - Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield. Leicester already has an elected Mayor.

Directly elected mayors mark another shift in the landmark transfer of powers from Whitehall back to communities, letting local people decide what is best for their area. The Government believes that elected mayors can provide the strong, democratically accountable leadership to maximise the potential for economic growth and investment in cities bringing real benefits for residents and businesses.

Cities Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Elected mayors provide cities with the strong, visible leadership that can help them prosper nationally and internationally. This is an opportunity for each city to transform itself for the better.
> 
> ""The world's great cities have mayors who lead for their city on the national and international stage, attracting investment and jobs. We believe that mayors can help English cities achieve their full potential too.
> 
> ""This May, the people of our cities will have the chance to have their say. Now is the time to start weighing up what a mayor could do for your city.""

The legal foundation for the role of directly elected mayors is the Government's Localism Act, which contains a wide range of decentralising measures. Mayors will have a crucial role to play in shaping the ongoing process of reform - negotiating with Ministers to specify and secure the specific powers that each community needs to prosper.

### Notes to Editors

1.  The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to create directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors. The Localism Act empowers local people to decide whether they want an elected mayor for their city. Mayoral referendums are being held on local Election Day on 3 May 2012. Leicester has recently elected a Mayor. Bristol will hold their next local election in 2013 and Nottingham will hold theirs in 2015.

2. If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that city will then hold an election for its first mayor on 15 November 2012. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

3. The Government recently published the document 'Unlocking growth in cities' available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/growthcities](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/growthcities).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1824355,Electrical fire safety week: 24-30 January 2011,"Overloaded sockets and overheated appliances are the watchwords next week as Electrical Fire Safety Week gets underway for the first time, raising awareness of one of the biggest causes of accidental house fires in the country.

Electrical appliances have become a staple of modern life - from fridges and phones to toasters or the TV, it's hard to think of how we'd get by without a few electrically-powered essentials. And in the wake of the recent cold weather, many sockets could still be loaded with heaters and electric blankets.

In 2007 over 60 percent of all accidental house fires were caused by electrical equipment so the Fire Kills campaign and local fire and rescue services have joined forces with the Electrical Safety Council to spread the fire safety message and ensure people are taking care with their appliances.

Faulty or misused electrical products caused over 20,000 fires across the country in 2007 with accidental electrical fires in the home resulting in 40 deaths and nearly 4,000 casualties. But while local fire and rescue services are working hard to bring this number down, every individual can take steps to protect themselves by checking that the electrical equipment they use everyday is in good shape and is operated properly.

Sir Ken Knight, the Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser said:

> ""Fire in the home can be devastating, but many of these fires are preventable. Over half of all accidental fires begin with an electrical appliance, so it's really important that everyone makes sure that their electrics are in good working order and are used properly. The majority of electrical fires start in the kitchen, so be extra careful when using cooking appliances. By following some simple steps, you can help keep you and your loved ones safe from fire.""

  * Don't overload plug sockets.
  * Regularly check for worn or frayed wires.
  * Unplug appliances when not in use.
  * Keep appliances clean and in good working order.

Lorraine Carney, Head of Campaigns at the Electrical Safety Council, a leading safety charity, warns:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1701561,End of the line for dickey straps in Hammersmith?,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today outlined plans to give councils a new power to review and get rid of outdated byelaws.

This means that councils will be able to scrap old local rules, like those about dickey straps in Hammersmith, fish frying in Gloucester, and carpet beating in Blackpool without having to get approval from central government.

It comes as part of wider Government plans to hand power back to councils and communities and the planned reforms will mean that councils can create new byelaws or get rid of old ones without seeking permission from Whitehall.

Under the current regime, councils would have to first contact the Secretary of State for Local Government for a stamp of approval before they can abolish outdated laws.

Instead, under these new reforms councils would be required to consult with local residents based on an assessment of why a law should be created or cancelled - with no need to involve central Government at all.

Existing byelaws which councils might choose to scrap include:

  * Byelaws relating to the use of dickey straps (the leather straps which hold the driving box of horse drawn carriages in place) and skidpans (A shoe or clog, attached to a chain, and placed under the wheel of a wagon to prevent its turning when descending a steep hill) from 1913 (London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Council)
  * An 1887 byelaw preventing the beating of carpets or the placing of any clothing or towels on the Promenade (Blackpool Borough Council)
  * A 1905 byelaw relating to the transport of dead horse carcasses. (London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Council)

And Gloucester City Council has told Ministers that they have unearthed 60 old bylaws they want to revoke and not replace, including:

  * A byelaw introduced in 1947 regarding the cleaning of ashpits and cesspools; and
  * A 1968 byelaw regulating fish frying and ""other offensive trades""

It's old byelaws like this that the new legislation will give councils the freedom to revoke without coming to Whitehall for the stamp of approval.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It should not take a rubber stamp from central Government to scrap outdated local laws. For far too long, councils have had to jump through hoops just to get things done for residents. That's why I want councils to use this new power I am offering them, and keep a watchful eye out for outdated rules that will soon be so much easier to scrap.
> 
> ""But people should also be free to contact their council with their concerns and have them addressed easily, so councils should also look to set local byelaws that improve their area - with no ministerial involvement whatsoever.
> 
> ""This is part of wider Government plans to devolve power straight from Whitehall to Town Halls and to communities, so they can improve the quality of their area for themselves.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2128610,England's array of enterprise zones go operational,"The next generation of Enterprise Zones are now 'operational sites' with 'live deals' immediately available for aspiring new businesses, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Every Enterprise Zone can now offer immediate tax breaks to businesses as soon as they move onto the site. The discount provides up to 100 per cent relief to new businesses for five years. Government is meeting the costs.

Each Zone is finalising ambitious simplified planning requirements for their sites. Many are using special locally developed planning regimes known as 'Local Development Orders' to grant automatic planning permission for certain development, such as new industrial buildings or a change to how existing buildings are used, within specified areas. This gives interested firms certainty about the development that will be allowed and removes the delays and costs associated with applying for planning permission.

Two thirds of the Zones will have at least one of these orders in place by the summer. Many of them will have multiple orders for their different sites. 18 orders have already been agreed, while eight more have completed the public consultation stage. A further 40 are in the pipeline.

Mr Pickles saw first hand how these planning changes are working on a visit to the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone, where six orders are now in place.

The Secretary of State looked around a company that is expanding their premises into the Beacon Park Technology Park because of enterprise zone incentives including the simplified planning arrangements.

Seajacks is a leading operator of purpose built self-propelled jack-up vessels for offshore wind farms in the North Sea.

The orders in the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone permit energy related development including new buildings, extensions, roads, telecommunications and low-carbon energy installations. All its sites will have superfast broadband by late 2012.

Six councils in the Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone have today agreed a deal for a uniform and more 'business friendly' planning approach with quicker permissions expected. Global manufacturer, X:Cel Superturn, is using a new £18 million contract to rapidly expand its operation into the Zone.

The Zones are also attracting foreign investors, showing Britain is great for business. Just last week Japanese logistics firm Vantec, a subsidiary of Nissan, became the first overseas company to invest, £24 million, in an Enterprise Zone, taking advantage of Sunderland's Enhanced Capital Allowances.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Local business and private sector commerce turn the wheels of our economy creating the jobs this country needs. This Government has set about fostering local enterprise and creating the conditions for businesses to thrive.
> 
> ""This week our low tax, low regulation, Enterprise Zones with superfast networks are going operational with live deals and incentives now available to entice new companies to the area.
> 
> ""We've planted these economic incubators all across the country to help accelerate growth, rebalance our economy with thousands of new businesses and local jobs in each location.
> 
> ""Enterprise Zones are set to become the crown jewels of how we make Britain the best place in the world to start and grow a business.""

The Budget 2011 announced that the Government would create a new generation of Enterprise Zones with simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses, would be established in local enterprise partnerships across England. The Zones have the potential to create tens of thousands of new jobs by 2015.

### Notes to editors

1. The business rates discount for businesses in Enterprise Zones went operational on 1 April 2012. The discount provides up to 100 per cent relief to new businesses with the sites for five years up to state aid de minimus levels. Authorities should now be providing the discounts using the new local discounts powers. Central Government is meeting the costs of the discount.

2. Great Yarmouth's local development orders enable development including: port and logistics related businesses, energy industries, electronic communications works, solar panels, site investigation works, offices, general industrial development, security cameras and wind turbines.

3. Local Development Order progress in the Enterprise Zones is as follows:

  * 18 orders have been agreed: six in Tees Valley, six in New Anglia Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, one in West of England Temple Quarter (Bristol), one in Sheffield Modern Manufacturing and Technology Growth Area, one in Black Country i54 and Darlaston, one in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Newquay Aerohub; one in South East Midlands Northampton Waterside, one in Lancashire and one in Leeds Lower Aire Valley

  * seven orders have completed consultation: one in Leeds Lower Aire Valley, one in Humber Estuary, one in New Anglia Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, one in the Marches, Hereford, two in Greater Birmingham and Solihull City Centre and one in North Eastern River Tyne and Nissan site

  * approximately 40 further Local Development Orders are in preparation across the Enterprise Zones.

4. Other Enterprise Zones are making progress in different ways:

  * The North Eastern Enterprise Zone confirmed that the £24 million of investment from Vantec, an integrated logistics company, will include 417,000 sq feet of new building, which will be operational in less from a year from now and will create 240 new jobs as well as safeguarding 800 existing jobs.
  * Global manufacturer X:Cel Superturn is set to expand its operations in the Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone after beating strong competition to win a major contract worth over £18 million to supply precision gaskets and sealing rings to a global subsea tree manufacturer.
  * In September 2011 Jaguar Land Rover announced it would build a £355 million engine plant on the i54 site - part of the Black Country Enterprise Zone. The first phase comprises 70,000sqm with a second expansion phase of around 65,000sqm. The plant will employ 750 staff and is due to be in operation by 2014.
  * The Enterprise Zones support Tees Valley's industries within the petro-chemical, renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and digital sectors helping create and support up to 1,200 jobs by 2015. Sites at Port Estates in Hartlepool, the New Energy and Technology Park in Billingham, as well as Wilton and PD Ports/South Bank Wharf (both in Redcar and Cleveland), can offer large-scale occupiers enhanced capital allowances against the cost of qualifying plant and machinery. Tees Valley are establishing their own locally funded Enterprise Zone sites to attract further investment in the area and support diversification of the local economy.
  * The Northampton Enterprise Zone will redevelop and regenerate a large area around Northampton station and along the River Nene. A planning application has now been submitted for a land-mark development on the site - a 3740sqm 'innovation cube' which will provide high quality accommodation for 60 start-up businesses.
  * The New Anglia local enterprise partnership has developed a 'soft landing' package to give targeted support to businesses locating in their Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone. This will include access to an energy sector support team; dedicated Inward Investment Director; access to key economic, cost and skills information; searches for suitable land and premises; introductions to supply chain partners; support from specialist energy sector knowledge hubs and access to UK Trade and Investment support. The Enterprise Zone covering six sites over 120 hectares will focus on offshore wind, port logistics and engineering. It is expected to create 80 businesses that would benefit from approximately £3.8 million in tax breaks.
  * The Greater Cambridge and Greater Peterborough Enterprise Zone - Alconbury Business Campus - will strengthen the manufacturing base across the partnership area, by encouraging ideas worked upon by scientists, academics and entrepreneurs to be produced locally rather that lost to overseas manufacturing. The Enterprise Zone will have a broad focus on ICT, bio-technology, pharmaceuticals, advanced manufacturing, creative industries, engineering and processing.
  * Across the board local enterprise partnerships are working with telecoms firms to make sure superfast broadband is the standard speed in Zones.

5. The Government has put forward a range of measures to develop Enterprise Zones and make them attractive places to do business.

  * A 100 per cent business rate discount worth up to £275,000 over a five year period (for businesses that move into an Enterprise Zone during the course of this Parliament).
  * All business rate growth generated by the Zone for a period of at least 25 years will be kept by that area.
  * Local Development Orders are available to local authorities to establish a simplified planning regime.
  * Government support to ensure that super fast broadband is rolled out throughout the Zones. This will be achieved through guaranteeing the most supportive planning environment and, if necessary, public funding.
  * The Government will make 100 per cent enhanced capital allowances available in the Black Country, Humber, Liverpool, North Eastern, Sheffield and Tees Valley Enterprise Zones to plant or machinery investment allowing them to write it down against taxable profits.

6. The following 24 Enterprise Zones now stretch across England:

Black Country i54 and Darlaston  
Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Newquay Aerohub  
Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Boots Campus

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2067038,England's major cities to decide own mayoral powers,"Elected city mayors will have their own bespoke powers tailored to local needs, Minister for Cities Greg Clark announced today.

Rather than seeking to impose a 'one size fits all' approach, the Government will take advantage of the new power in the Localism Act to devolve power to mayors through negotiating a bespoke city deal with each city.

The Government's approach for bespoke, locally tailored powers for city mayors was confirmed as the right way forward, following the ""What can a mayor do for your city?"" consultation.

The Coalition Agreement set out the Government's commitment to create directly elected mayors in England's 12 largest cities outside of London, if backed by local electors in a referendum and following full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Referendums will take place in May 3 in 11 cities - Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield. Leicester has recently elected a mayor.

Where a mayor is elected, cities will be expected to come forward with proposals for the powers and services they want decentralised and handed to their city mayor. Evidence from London and beyond shows the difference elected mayors can make. They can provide strong and visible leadership, and take the decisions needed to attract jobs and investment for the future.

Cities Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Each one of our great cities is unique, with different needs, characteristics and ambitions. The Localism Act allows the Government to devolve the powers to any city that the city requests and that is the approach that we will take to new mayors.
> 
> ""A bespoke approach to each city is consistent with the approach set out in 'Unlocking Growth in Cities' which the Government published before Christmas, and the consultation has endorsed this approach.""

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham said:

> ""Our cities should have the best leadership possible to help them flourish and as we've seen in London and other cities, an elected mayor can make a real difference in attracting jobs and investment and tackling difficult decisions head on.
> 
> ""Ensuring elected mayors will have a set of powers that are tailored to local need will put our cities in a stronger position to step up and take on local challenges quickly, and help them thrive in the future.""

Ensuring cities can have their say on the powers their mayor should have is in line with the Government's recent announcement on tailoring 'city deals' with England's eight core cities. These deals will consist of new powers for cities so they are in the strongest possible position to support private sector growth.

But in return for these new 'city deal' powers and freedoms Government is asking for reassurances in a number of areas including leadership and accountability. Cities will need to show strong, visible, accountable leaders who provide vision and direction. Evidence suggests that the democratic mandate provided by directly elected mayors is one way to provide strong and proactive leadership.

### Notes to editors

1. The Government was responding to the consultation ""What can a mayor do for your city?"" which ended on 3 January 2012.

2. The Government received 58 responses to the consultation. Responses were received from city councils, parish councils, chambers of commerce, public bodies and members of the public.

3. A 2004 survey showed that 57 per cent of the public could name their elected mayor from a prompt list, compared to just a quarter who could name their council leader - Randle, A (2004) Mayors in mid-term: lessons from the eighteen months of directly-elected mayors.

4. The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to creating directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London subject to confirmatory referenda. The Localism Act gives areas the right to have an elected Mayor. Mayoral referendums will be held on the local Election Day (for the majority of cities) in May 2012.

5. If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that city will then rapidly hold an election for its first mayor. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

6. The proposals relate solely to the 12 cities, and Mayors elected in other places would not be affected by them.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1911915,Enterprise Zone competition moves up a gear as applications issued,"The competition to find the location of the next ten Enterprise Zones will be based on proposals that offer the best prospects to increase growth Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The Government has said it wants to create a new generation of 21 Enterprise Zones across England that will have simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses to promote growth.

This week the criteria and application forms have been sent out to the 29 existing or prospective local enterprise partnerships that have told government they would like to establish one of the ten second wave Enterprise Zones.

The Government proposed an open competition for areas who want to bid to host one of the ten remaining Enterprise Zone spots to ensure the best possible applications come forward for these unique growth opportunities.

Local enterprise partnerships, which bring together local businesses and local councils, are expected to nominate specific sites that offer the best opportunity for growth. Applicants will have to show their prospective zone has genuine potential to create the new business and jobs they need, with positive benefits across the wider economic area.

The applications, due by 30 June 2011, will be assessed against three key criteria of success developed by the Government:

  * Ability to deliver growth and jobs: the strategy to drive sustainable economic growth should be clear and evidence based.
  * Value for money: the proposal should deliver as much as possible for the investment being made.
  * Implementation: plans for delivery are robust and support the growth focus of the bid.

When selecting the winners, the Government will look at issues such as the choice of site; plans for development; targeting of sectors; and specific plans by local areas to remove barriers to business growth and reduce costs. As enterprise zones are designed to encourage new businesses, it is expected that proposed sites will be 'clean', with no or very few existing businesses in place. It is also expected that there will be no more than one Enterprise Zone per local enterprise partnership. However, the Government is keen to see the best proposals possible and so will consider granting a second zone to an area where a compelling and well-evidenced case can be made.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles:

> ""Today the competition for the next ten Enterprise Zones really gets under way and I urge all contenders to seize this opportunity to put forward top class proposals.
> 
> ""I'm delighted by how many areas have put themselves forward, but only the best applications will get a zone. To succeed they must be ambitious for jobs, committed to reducing the barriers to enterprise and eager to create a springboard for growth.
> 
> ""Enterprise Zones will transform twenty one under-utilised parts of the country into business magnets attracting new companies to the area with tax breaks and simplified planning regimes.""

Business Minister Mark Prisk added:

> ""There is a wide range of opportunities for local enterprise partnerships to take the lead in securing local economic growth and creating jobs. Enterprise Zones will bring a number of benefits to local businesses and communities, and I'm delighted at the number of local enterprise partnerships expressing an interest in hosting a site.
> 
> ""As part of the Enterprise Zone package, successful sites will benefit from discounted business rates, super-fast broadband and help to speed planning approvals. We want the right conditions in place to help businesses and organisations to succeed.""

The first eleven vanguard Enterprise Zones were announced in the Budget and will be based within eleven local enterprise partnerships lead by Birmingham and Solihull, Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, West of England, the Black Country, Derby and Nottingham, Teesside and the North East.

All Enterprise Zones will benefit from:

  * a business rate discount worth up to £275,000 per eligible business over a five year period

  * all business rates growth within the zone for a period of at least 25 years will be shared and retained by the local area, to support the Partnership's economic priorities and ensure that Enterprise Zone growth is reinvested locally

  * government help to develop radically simplified planning approaches for the zone using, for example, existing local powers to grant automatic planning permission

  * Government support to ensure that superfast broadband is rolled out throughout the zone, achieved through guaranteeing the most supportive regulatory environment and, if necessary, public funding.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1941309,Armchair auditors are here to stay,"Greater local financial control must go hand in hand with greater willingness to open accounts to local scrutiny, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has said.  
   
Speaking to an audience of Local Government finance professionals, Mr Pickles emphasised the essential role financial transparency has played in eliminating waste and inefficiency to deliver value for money to the taxpayer and help protect services.

Mr Pickles signalled the next wave of Government transparency would be for councils to publish details of all contracts and tenders over £500 online. This follows the publication of spending over £500 online.  
   
The Secretary of State said a new wave of local scrutiny by citizen journalists, microbloggers and armchair auditors - what he labelled his 'citizen samizdat' - was a triumph and encouraged councils to welcome them into the world of local government finance.

He reminded councils he intends to publish a list of when all council ledgers are opened to the public. Under law councils are required to hold a financial open day. He thanked finance officers that had already given the Department their dates.

Mr Pickles went on to argue that with central controls over council finances being relinquished greater transparency must be the spur to greater competition and efficiency in spending, which can help avoid incidents like those that took place in Barnet and Islington:

  * In Barnet serious deficiencies in procurement arrangements saw the council spend over £1m of taxpayers' money to hire a private security firm with no tendering exercise, contract or proper invoicing. It was uncovered by local armchair auditors and activist bloggers
  * In Islington an independent audit of thirty of the council's top five hundred suppliers found that many invoices had been paid more than once.

Mr Pickles said: 

> ""Live blogging from council meetings, micro-journalism, call it what you like - it's here to stay. In fact this citizen samizdat - local people reporting on their local council's triumphs and shortcomings - is the perfect counterblast to town hall Pravdas.
> 
> ""The next wave of transparency after publishing spending over £500, will be councils publishing contracts and tenders over £500 online as well. An online list of council contracts will prevent a repeat of the likes of Islington or Barnet, and will spur on greater competition and efficiency.
> 
> ""And it doesn't just strengthen the hand of citizens. It strengthens the hand of rank and file councillors, letting them know what officials are doing on their behalf.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1746990,Council Tax bills frozen in spending review,"Eric Pickles has said council tax bills will be frozen next year - as a result of a deal struck in the Spending Review.

With the Treasury agreeing to set aside an extra £650 million all councils will be able to freeze bills next year - meaning local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £70.

This honours the Coalition Agreement to freeze council tax and comes despite tough fiscal decisions being taken in the Spending Review.

Council tax has more than doubled since 1997 and Ministers believe that a freeze will offer real help to hard working families and those on fixed incomes such as pensioners.

Communities and Local Government Secretary of State, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""Hard working families and pensioners have seen their council tax bills more than double since 1997. But the new Government is standing up for hard-pressed local residents, providing special funding to help councils freeze their bills next year. Further financial freedoms announced for councils will mean they can better protect frontline services like rubbish collections and care for the elderly.
> 
> ""The new Government has already stopped the council tax revaluation which would have lead to higher council tax bills over this Parliament for many families. And we will give local residents a new power to veto excessive council tax rises in the future, to protect the interests of local communities and strengthen local democracy.""

Scotland has benefited from a council tax freeze for a number of years, without adversely affecting frontline services, and in this time the average bill in England has risen so that an equivalent Band D home now pays £290 a year more than that north of the border.

A new grant scheme will be open to all billing and major precepting authorities, including police and fire authorities, which decide to freeze or reduce their council tax next year. If they do, they will receive additional funding in 2011-12, equivalent to raising their 2010-11 council tax by 2.5 per cent.

The Spending Review also commits to providing authorities with additional funding in future years to 'lock in' the benefits of the one year freeze and help ensure council tax payers will not face subsequent excessive increases.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1616244,Councils must become savvy shoppers,"Too often councils are getting ripped off when procuring goods or services even though the nation's deficit is running at £156bn.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is calling on councils to buy smarter and make every pound go further. Local Government spends £42bn a year on outside contracts including everything from construction and IT to telecoms and catering. That is more than the national GDP of ninety countries including Luxembourg, Jordan and Albania.

There are massive (in some cases up to 745 per cent) differences between what parts of the public sector, including councils, are paying.

Ministers believe that a fortune could be saved if more councils use their collective buying power and innovative technology like e-auctions to bring the full weight of the public pound to bear on driving down costs and getting better value for taxpayers money.

If councils work together to jointly buy goods and services they can achieve major economies of scale through better deals from suppliers.

The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) found that only 12 per cent of local government used approved collaborative deals, way below the recommended level of fifty per cent.

Next week the Local Government Association will host an 'enhancing productivity' meeting chaired by Eric Pickles and Baroness Eaton to help councils improve value for money, procurement practices and collaboration in an effort to protect services.

Councils own and maintain a lot of assets. For example 470,000 civic buildings; over 50,000 vehicles including more than 6,000 bin lorries; over 1 million (1.27m) computers. The National Audit Office found that what the public sector was paying varied dramatically:

  * The cost of toner varied widely by 745 per cent between the lowest and highest prices (£0.0022 to £0.0186 per sheet) paid for the same broad specification of laser printer black toner.
  * The cost of envelopes varied by 348 per cent between the lowest and highest prices (£2.04 to £9.13) paid for the same broad specification of manila envelopes.
  * The cost of paper varied by 116 per cent between the lowest and highest prices (£6.84 to £14.79) paid for the same broad specification of paper.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Some councils have a supermarket sized budget but a cornershop mentality. This has got to change. Local authorities need to look at where every penny is going and what that money is delivering.
> 
> ""Shining a light on spending will help to put savings before cuts. Whilst councils have already delivered significant efficiencies there is still more excess waste to cut back.
> 
> ""A renewed and concerted focus on better procurement, greater transparency and shared services that puts the emphasis on productivity above processes will end duplication, wasteful spending and wasteful working.""

The Secretary of State has written to councils to tell them that transparency and openness must be the default setting for the way they do their business and called on local government to move at speed to adopt plans to publish details of all spending over £500 in full and online.

Greater transparency will root out wild overspending, expensive mistakes and waste and could be the key to saving the public purse millions of pounds.

For example, the Audit Commission has abandoned plans to appoint a new Chief Executive after Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said the proposed remuneration deal on offer was against the spirit of public sector austerity and that it would send a signal to councils across the country that they too can stop paying ridiculous sums to chief executives.

The expectation is that councils will see the benefits for residents and grasp this agenda. Increased scrutiny is not just about savings. It is about new approaches to the way services are delivered. Efforts to deal with some of the most complex problems in communities are too often approached in a separate rather than joined up way.

Police, social services and health work are too often approaching the same problem from a different perspective rather than working together to achieve a shared result. This duplication of spending, targets, reports and paperwork are costly, time intensive and do not provide the solutions that are needed.

There is real scope for joint working between agencies and between authorities that could transform the way that services are delivered and make the challenge of doing more for less a reality.

### Notes to editors

The LGA's Improvement and Development Agency suggest in total councils spend:

  * Over £2bn each year on waste management procurement
  * £1.4bn each year on electricity and gas
  * £2.2bn per annum on the procurement of temporary agency staff and £1.8bn on external consultants
  * Over £4bn each year on ICT equipment and related services - they own over 1 million (1.27m) computers
  * £16.2bn each year on construction
  * About £18bn each year on adult social care including £11.6bn on external providers.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2016851,Help for the High Street in the wake of the riots,"Hundreds of businesses have already benefited from the multi-million pound package of support made available to communities in the immediate aftermath of the summer disturbances, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Ministers responded to the riots with immediate help by making a multi-million package of support available in grants and tax relief to ease financial pressures, get shops open and repair damaged high streets, which 35 councils have taken up.

Mr Pickles used a speech to council leaders at the Local Government Association to reaffirm Government's commitment for councils to pull out all the stops, support high street recovery and get businesses back on their feet. He highlighted examples of councils up and down the country that have dedicated time and resources to getting help to individuals and businesses. He also congratulated them for supporting communities to get back up and running, backed up by central government funding and assistance.

Mr Pickles also used his speech to announce that shopkeepers and businesses affected will get extra time to apply for financial support and assistance. The deadline for councils to submit claims under the Government's £20 million High Street Support Scheme was originally set for early November. In response to requests from councils and shopkeepers and to cover the crucial Christmas period, the Communities Secretary has taken the decision to extend the deadline until the New Year. He is adamant that money available must reach those that need it.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Both central and local government are making sure the innocent victims of these mindless acts of looting and violence are not left to pick up the pieces on their own. Real help is being delivered to local firms and local residents.
> 
> ""Councils deserve immense credit for the way in which they swung into action in the days during and after the disturbances. Local leadership played a massive part in limiting the distress and difficulty that families, individuals and businesses faced.
> 
> ""It is great to see examples from across the country of how the support can and is being delivered in the right way. Affected councils are still receiving claims from businesses, and we have listened to councils in agreeing more time for them to promote pride and increase footfall in their high streets in the run up to Christmas.""

Many councils have been very quick off the mark in offering all kinds of support to local traders: 

**Croydon Council** has provided more than £205,500 of interest free loans to the worst affected traders to help them get back on their feet. Thanks to their swift support, most traders re-opened their businesses very quickly. The council granted  £1,000 to any business with a crime reference number to help with the clean up. The police made direct contact with the council, which then made a payment without the need for a formal 'claim' to be made by the affected businesses. So far the council has given £249,000 in hardship grants to businesses, £137,129 in business rates hardship relief, which forms part of the council's £882,000 local investment from the High Street Support Scheme as well as an additional £145,000 being provided from the Croydon Enterprise Loan Fund.

When the Communities Secretary visited **Salford** he saw how the council quickly put in place an ""I love Salford"" campaign to galvanise civic pride. Residents and local businesses have been sporting ""I love Salford"" badges, displayed posters and giant ""I love Salford"" messages in shop windows.

**Wandsworth** immediately offered grants of up to £2000 to replace stock, suspended business rates collection straightaway to ease cash flow pressures and introduced a business rate discount scheme for eligible businesses that was backdated to the first day of the riots and will continue until April next year.

In **Ealing**, small independent traders were given £1,200 each to help them pay for things like new glazing and repairs.

**Haringey** immediately began to coordinate activity which included the establishment of a dedicated 'Tottenham Business Advice Service' for residents and businesses affected by the riots to receive advice on housing, insurance, legal and business continuity. The Council has offered up to three months hardship relief exemption from business rates for businesses within the affected area.

**Wolverhampton** will be funding, under the High Street Support Scheme, £110,000 on security blinds; £45,000 on promotions for city centre (""700 reasons to shop in Wolverhampton"" campaign - referring to its 700 shops). They have also supported radio coverage and competitions for independent traders.

### Notes to editors

1. The package of support announced on 11 August for businesses affected by the public disorder included:

  * **A £10m Recovery Fund** to help councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe, clear and clean again. Funding can be used, for example, to clear debris left strewn in streets and make immediate repairs to pavements and roads. This Recovery scheme can also be used to support councils who use their powers to offer council tax discounts or **council tax relief** to those whose homes have been damaged but are still habitable. Local Authorities can submit claims under this scheme up to 7 November.
  * **A £20m High Street Support Scheme** - funded jointly by the Departments for Communities and Local Government, and Business, Innovation and Skills, for the streets and areas where businesses were affected by the rioting. The money is intended to finance those measures that will get business trading again and meet short term costs. Councils are using funding to reduce business rates, finance building repairs and encourage customers back to the affected areas. **The payment deadline to businesses has been extended from 5 October 2011 to 3 January 2012. The Local Authority claims deadline for costs under the scheme has also been extended from 7 November 2011 to 31 January 2012.**
  * Councils have the power to offer business **rate relief for local firms**, but must pay a quarter of the cost; central government automatically pays for three quarters of the cost. The High Street Support Scheme will help reimburse councils for this cost, to facilitate immediate and real financial help to be given to local firms to rebuild their businesses. Business rates are typically the third biggest outgoing for firms after rent and staff.
  * In addition, seriously damaged homes and business properties were able to be taken off the respective valuation lists. The Communities Secretary strongly encouraged the Valuation Office Agency and local authorities to do so as promptly as possible. **This removes any liability for council tax or business rates.**

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1682879,New era of transparency will bring about a revolution in town hall openness and accountability,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Local Government Association Chair Baroness Eaton joined forces today to urge all councils to publish details of all spending over £500 in full and online as part of wider action to bring about a revolution in town hall openness and accountability.

The call for greater disclosure on spending is just one of a series of sweeping measures detailed in a letter being sent to councils by the Secretary of State today. He makes clear that transparency and openness should be the default setting for the way councils do business, and calls on local government to move at speed to adopt this new approach.

The letter sets out proposals for a move to open local government. Councils are being encouraged to throw open their files and publish, alongside spending data, information on salaries, job titles, allowances and expenses, minutes of meetings and more.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Getting council business out in the open will revolutionise local government.  Local people should be able to hold politicians and public bodies to account over how their hard earned cash is being spent and decisions made on their behalf. They can only do that effectively if they have the information they need at their fingertips.
> 
> ""The public should be able to see where their money goes and what it delivers. The swift and simple changes we are calling for today will unleash an army of armchair auditors and quite rightly make those charged with doling out the pennies stop and think twice about whether they are getting value for money.
> 
> ""Throwing open the council books will open the door to new businesses and encourage greater innovation and entrepreneurism. Organisations that might have been effectively locked out before, including voluntary sector and small business, will be in a much stronger position to pitch for contracts and bring new ideas and solutions to the table.""

By September councils will be expected to make details of spending on all goods and services - from car hire to consultancy fees from storage to software costs - that fall above the £500 threshold available for the public to see and scrutinise. All councils should be doing this as a matter of course by the start of next year, as well as publishing invitations to tender and final contracts on projects over £500.

Financial disclosure will act as a trigger enabling local taxpayers to see how councils are using public money, shine a spotlight on waste, establish greater accountability and efficiency, open up new markets and improve access for small and local business and the voluntary sector.

But making spending data public is just the tip of the iceberg. Building on excellent work already under way in some councils, the route map sets down a plan of action that will see a wealth of data being made available online including:

  * **Local government salaries** - Government will consult on greater disclosure of senior staff salaries by name and job descriptions
  * **Councillor allowances and expenses** - Greater clarity on councillors' costs
  * **Council minutes and papers** - consistent publication of what is being discussed and what has been decided
  * **Job vacancies** - showing local people what kind of jobs are contributing to the wage bill, driving down advertising costs and allowing comparison of pay ranges
  * **Frontline service data** - including rubbish and recycling rates, council tax collection rates and details of major planned projects
  * **Licensing applications and decisions** - giving residents more clarity on what was happening in their area and an early opportunity to raise concerns or objections
  * **Planning applications and decisions** - making sure residents have online access to information about planning applications that could affect them and the look and feel of their area, and making it easier for them to influence emerging development ideas
  * **Food hygiene reports for food outlets** - one example of information which is routinely collected and of interest to residents, but not currently shared in an easily accessible format

Some of this information is already in the public domain but not always in a format that makes it easy to be republished, re-used or mashed up by outside groups, without charge or copyright hindrance. A key part of the change will be getting information in the public domain in a standardised format.

The Local Government Association will work closely with its member councils to help them deliver on this agenda.

Baroness Eaton, Chairman of the Local Government Association said:

> ""Local government is absolutely committed to the highest standards of transparency. Councils have been leading the way in giving taxpayers real, detailed and vital information about how their money is spent. All public bodies must be scrutinised for the spending decisions they make, and the LGA will work with councils to pioneer an approach of openness and accountability.""

The changes being outlined today reflect changes being made in central government to reveal previously hidden details of Whitehall spending and information.

The Government is committed to bringing about a radical devolution of power to local government including freedom from central control, greater flexibility over spending and less red tape. The changes will put councils in the driving seat when it comes to meeting the needs of residents but greater powers must be accompanied with greater accountability.

The move to greater accountability is set against changes to significantly cut the inspection burden. The abolition of the bureaucratic and over burdensome Comprehensive Area Assessment regime will save councils up to £39 million a year, which is equivalent to 151,000 working days.

### Notes to editors

1. The Government is looking to progress this agenda quickly and has set out a timetable for change:

  * Initial guidelines about how to publish payments over £500 will be produced by developers, and published online at [www.data.gov.uk](http://www.data.gov.uk/) (external link) for comment and debate.
  * This will be followed by guidelines on how to publish contracts and invitations to tender over £500.
  * In **September** draft Codes of Practice on payments over £500 and contracts/invitations to tender over £500, informed by the online discussions, will be published for formal consultation.
  * Final Codes of Practice will be published in **November**, so all authorities are able to publish in **January 2011**.

The broader push on transparency will be an iterative process, driven by the local government and developer sector within the framework set out by government. The route to more transparency and open local government will include work on: types of information and data to be published; standardisation of information and data; types of bodies publishing information and data; proposals for the 'Right to Government data' Bill; reduction in top down assessment and inspection so that citizens take on that role; proposals for greater local accountability; proposals for simplified approach in accessing data.

2. The measures being set out today build on previous action taken to increase accountability and transparency in Local Government including:

  * **The Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960:** This opened up meetings to the public, allowing members of the public and press to attend meetings of certain public bodies
  * **Local Government Act 1972:** the requirement for councillors to make declarations of interest. Also access to agendas documents and reports Sec.100 (b)
  * **Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980:** S.96 provides for registers of land holdings held under that act to be made available. The aim of the register is to list  land holdings of local government bodies which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, are being under-utilised and make that list available to the public
  * **The Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985:** an Act to provide for greater public access to local authority meetings reports and documents subject to specified confidentiality provisions; to give local authorities duties to publish certain information; and for related purposes.
  * **Local Government Housing Act 1989 - The Local Authorities (Members' Allowances) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 1991 (as amended):** the regulations place certain duties on local authorities in connection with publishing the recommendations made by their independent remuneration panel, their scheme of allowances and the actual allowances paid to any member in any given year
  * **Local Government Finance Act 1992:** allows rights of members of the public to obtain information with respect to local domestic rating lists
  * **Freedom of Information Act 2000:** allows access to information held by public authorities
  * **Local Government Act 2000:** makes provision for access to information held by local authority executives e.g. leaders, elected mayors

3. A number of public sector bodies have already wholeheartedly embraced the transparency agenda. Making use of existing information and simple technology has led to greater openness which in turn is helping to weed out and cut down waste and increase efficiency. Local people and organisations are already using the information out there to create applications and strengthen the links between the citizen and the council. For more information see the case studies attached below.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1662256,Replacing bureaucratic accountability with democratic accountability,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles pledges to end a culture of paper chasing today as the Department for Communities and Local Government publishes latest performance and spending data for 2009-10.

The data relates to the performance of the previous administration.

As a consequence of the change in administration and the ending of the previous Government's performance framework individual Departments are not publishing Departmental Annual Reports this year. Instead each Department is required to publish a table setting out the latest information on its performance and a series of financial tables.

One of the Communities and Local Government tables published today gives latest information on performance on the Department's Public Service Agreement and Departmental Strategic indicators. Other tables include detail on Departmental spending (including contributions to local authorities in the area of Departments responsibility) in 2009-10 and the five preceding years.

Of the 52 indicators included in the table:

  * 21 of the associated targets were on track to be met, seven were deemed to be off track, 12 at risk, one not met and 11 were partially or wholly not yet assessed
  * targets deemed at risk included the number of affordable homes being built and reduction in planning applications subject to appeal
  * the target to have seven out of eight regional spatial strategies (the previous government's strategy to deliver more homes) in place by 2008-09 was not met
  * targets on track for delivery included plans to regenerate East London as part of the Olympic Legacy programme; reductions in the number of fires and fire related deaths and a decrease in the number of people who feel that racial or religious harassment is a problem in their local area

The Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Complex, ever shifting targets and paper chasing hasn't built homes or created a fairer planning system. For too long those tasked with working for the public have been tied up by red tape that has stifled innovation in favour of indicators.
> 
> ""We are moving away from bureaucratic accountability to democratic accountability. We are doing away with endless tick boxing. We want civil servants to spend less time form filling and more time just getting on with the job.
> 
> ""Fifty something targets and objectives have been replaced by a clear and simple plan. We have set out what this Department is all about and what it is going to do and we will be accountable for delivering that to the people, not the Government machine.""

Changes to the way that Government reports to the people are part of sweeping measures to remove swathes of centralising diktats and cut red tape.

The plan sets out the department's five priority actions for making localism and the Big Society part of everyday life by:

  * decentralising power as far as possible
  * meeting people's housing aspirations
  * putting communities in charge of planning
  * increasing accountability
  * letting people see how their money is being spent

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1666181,Eric Pickles announces new measures to stop 'lobbying on the rates',"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has announced plans to increase transparency and stop the practice of local authorities hiring lobbyists.

A consultation will be launched to update the Local Authority Publicity Code, which guards against campaigning with public funds. It will include stronger guidance to stop tax payer money from being spent on private lobbying contractors to persuade the public or Government to take a particular view on specific policies.

Mr Pickles has already instructed all his department's quangos, including Ordnance Survey and the Tenants Services Authority, to cancel their contracts with lobbying firms. The Audit Commission's lobbying contract ended in February 2010.

Ministers believe that using taxpayers' funds on local government campaigns or to lobby government wastes public money as it gets used beyond the local area; public policy is weakened when conducted by private lobbying firms. They are private organisations not subject to Freedom of Information or transparency rules. The government will continue to conduct business with local government through existing direct channels.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Taxpayer-funded lobbying and propaganda on the rates weakens our democracy. So-called town hall newspapers are already closing down scrutiny from independent local papers. Now lobbyists are being used to sidestep transparency laws and shadowy figures are peddling more regulation and special favours.
> 
> ""Local activism and localism don't need lobbyists. If local politicians want to change the way government operates, their council should send a letter or pick up the phone. Councillors can campaign for change at a personal or party political level, rather than throwing away other people's council tax on the corrosive and wasteful practice of government lobbying government. Tough new rules will lower the cost of politics and increase transparency.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1629691,Eric Pickles appeals to council workers for their cost cutting ideas,"![Spending Challenge](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1629565.jpg)Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is today calling on frontline local government workers to send Downing Street their best cost-saving ideas via the newly launched [Spending Challenge website](http://spendingchallenge.hm-treasury.gov.uk/) (external link).

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have written to the UK's six million public sector workers, urging them to submit their suggestions for delivering better services for less money.

Local councils have a good track record of cutting waste and coming up with new ways of doing things so that money can be channeled to the frontline and spent on the services that matter most to their citizens. For example West Devon and South Hams Councils have just placed the first ever job advert for a cost-saving shared chief executive who will be responsible for the day to day running of both authorities simultaneously.

### Help us find the right savings

But Mr Pickles is convinced it's those who work at the 'coalface' and who come into contact with the public day in, day out - the housing officer, the librarian, the dinner lady, the refuse collector, the planning officer - that are in the very best position to spot inefficiencies and come up with radical and innovative ways of doing things differently. Now is the time to give these ideas a national platform. The PM has promised that every serious idea will be given serious consideration and the most promising ones taken forward in the Spending Review process.

The Coalition Government has already acted swiftly to release local government from the dead-hand of central control, including scrapping the costly and burdensome inspection regime for councils. At the same time, it has set in train a radical programme to push power as far away from the centre as possible and to give local people power to influence what happens in their area.

The Spending Challenge is part of the commitment to 'trust the people'.

In turn, Ministers want to see council workers using their inspiration and insight to help tackle the nation's deficit. Of the £122bn projected to be spent this year by local government, a third is going on outside contracts where massive differences exist between what councils are paying for the same product or service. Ministers want local government employees to hunt out these variations and propose ways of getting the most profligate councils to follow the lead of the most thrifty.

For example at South Tyneside Council they redesigned their waste and recycling website pages after realising over 90 per cent of queries were made by telephone costing £3.22 per call while a web visit cost just 27p per visitor. After their website re-design two thirds of all enquiries were made online - a real cost-saver and a better service. And the National Audit Office found that the cost of buying in toner cartridges varied by a staggering 745 per cent, while envelopes varied by 348 per cent and paper by 116 per cent.

In his rallying call to frontline workers, Eric Pickles said:

> ""Have you ever had an idea for saving money at work but no way of making it happen? Now is your time to step up. The new Government wants to hear your ideas for cutting the backroom waste so we can protect the frontline services that matter.
> 
> ""The country is facing up to the £176bn debt left behind by the last Government which means there will be less money for local government in the coming years. But this Government trusts you to do the right thing, which is why we are handing you more power. And it's why we are deadly serious about giving you a say on where and how the country cuts its costs.""

Ministers are already working with local government to help them find the right savings and recently supported the launch of the LGA's _Local Government's National Productivity & Efficiency Programme_. Last week Mr Pickles co-chaired with LGA chief Dame Margaret Eaton the launch of this new drive.

There are already several positive examples of councils taking forward ambitious saving schemes so it's clear there is plenty of innovation in local government- for example at Oxfordshire County Council where £4.5m annual savings were found following the consolidation of HR and finance services.

The Spending Challenge website is open to public sector workers now, and will be opened up to the general public on 8 July.

In a speech to more than 400 members of the British Bangladeshi community, the Secretary of State recognised the many contributions that Bangladeshis have made to British society and beyond. He also emphasised the importance of everyone, from every community, feeling that they can get involved in their local neighbourhood.

The Communities Secretary said:

> ""The Bangladeshi community plays an active role in every sphere of British life and those being awarded tonight are a real inspiration.
> 
> ""As well as the individuals being recognised tonight, Bangladeshi people across the country are more likely than any other ethnic minority group to be involved in local decision-making bodies. In other words, Bangladeshi people are asking, not what their local area can do for them, but what they can do for their local area. Commitment like that - that readiness to get involved - is always to be applauded, and has never been more vital than today.
> 
> ""British Bangladeshis will continue to be an important part of the fabric of this country and it's a pleasure to celebrate today the outstanding achievements of the community"".

Appearing as Chief Guest at the launch of this year's edition of the British Bangladeshi Who's Who publication, Mr Pickles spoke alongside Rushanara Ali, the first ever MP of Bangladeshi origin, and the Bangladeshi High Commissioner, Dr M Sayedur Rahman Khan.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1738897,Eric Pickles calls for greater transparency as new research suggests councils could be overpaying by as much as £150 million a year,"An examination of town hall books that reveals councils could be wasting nearly £150m on duplicate payments betrays a lack of respect towards public money, the Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has argued.

A project between Leeds City Council and credit experts Experian recovered £500,000 in overpayments to suppliers. Internal auditing by the London Borough of Islington that involved checking invoices to their top thirty suppliers revealed that ten had been paid twice and two more paid three times. The overpayments totalled £55,000.

Experian estimates that if more councils were to repeat this simple exercise, up to £147m could be saved.

In a speech ahead of the Government's Spending Review the Secretary of State used the data to highlight concerns that councils are effectively ""letting money slip through their fingers"". He said that the very process of publishing spending over £500 online would help stop duplicate payments and stressed that the need for councils to ""show us the money"" was more important than ever.

Referring to the estimated savings, Mr Pickles said:

> ""Now, you might say well, that is small potatoes. Hardly enough to plug the gaping holes in the public deficit. But actually, £147m would pay the wages of nearly nine thousand care workers.
> 
> ""And more importantly, it betrays a particular attitude. A lack of respect towards public money. And at every level of government, that has got to change.""

Mr Pickles used the speech to send a clear message to public servants that they must not forget whose money they are spending and made clear that the ""days of throwing money at problems are over"".

He reiterated that transparency, productivity and innovation must be the watchwords for the way councils do their business from here onwards.

Underlining his commitment to localism, he said that the years of Government micromanaging were over and that councils would be put back in charge of their own money.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1602678,Eric Pickles calls on councils to crackdown on unauthorised bank holiday building,"Communities and Local Government Secretary of State Eric Pickles is taking pre-emptive action to prevent unauthorised development over this coming bank holiday weekend.

Mr Pickles is writing to all Local Authority Chief Planners to warn them to be on alert and ready for action if any significant planning applications get submitted before the bank holiday.

### Illegal development

In the past some people have used extended weekends to put in last minute applications to their council on the Friday. They then spend the extended weekend illegally developing the land, for example cutting down protected trees or laying concrete driveways. These developments are often at quite an advanced stage by the time council planning officers return after the holiday and are able to call a temporary halt on activity.

### Rapid enforcement action

Mr Pickles is encouraging Councils to have planning officers on call over the weekend, ready to deal with last minute applications and take rapid enforcement action against any unauthorised development. This will also help reduce the volume of retrospective planning applications, which are expensive for the taxpayer, put an unnecessary strain on the planning system and are not fair to the vast majority of people who play by the rules.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""This new coalition government will not stand back and allow a small minority of people to deliberately exploit the extended weekend and planning procedure to carry out unauthorised developments.
> 
> ""That's why I'm calling on councils to take precautionary measures and make sure that they have planning officers ready to deal with any planning applications submitted over the weekend.
> 
> ""We want to ensure fair play in the planning system and as part of this we will be strengthening the powers of councils to tackle unauthorised development.""

The Secretary of state for Communities and Local Government introduced an urgent Bill that will stop the plan to create unitary councils in these areas.

His action will save the taxpayer £40m and will halt the diversion of time and money away from the priority of improving frontline services  

### Pulling the plug

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""When the priority must be to tackle the immense public deficit we have inherited, it is ludicrous that taxpayers' money is being wasted imposing a council reorganisation in Exeter and Norwich.
> 
> ""This Government made it clear in its Coalition Agreement that reducing unnecessary spending would be part of how we cut the deficit. Today I am pulling the plug on this expensive distraction and saving the taxpayer £40m of restructuring costs.
> 
> ""Councils in Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk will now be able to concentrate on delivering services to their communities and achieving genuine savings for the local people who elected them.""

### Facts and figures

  * Stopping the changes will save the taxpayer £40m in restructuring costs.
  * There will be less pressure on local council tax bills.
  * Creating a unitary council in Exeter would add over £200 to local tax bills according to estimates by Devon County Council.
  * In a recent consultation, over half of Norfolk and the vast majority (85 per cent) of Devon favoured no change to their council.
  * The majority of councils affected by the changes were very opposed and saw it as an example of Government interference.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1742133,Eric Pickles celebrates British Bangladeshi achievements,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles gave credit to some of the most successful and influential British Bangladeshi people at an awards ceremony in East London on Thursday night.

In his speech to more than 400 members of the British Bangladeshi community, the Secretary of State recognised the many contributions that Bangladeshis have made to British society and beyond. He also emphasised the importance of everyone, from every community, feeling that they can get involved in their local neighbourhood.

The Communities Secretary said:

> ""The Bangladeshi community plays an active role in every sphere of British life and those being awarded tonight are a real inspiration.
> 
> ""As well as the individuals being recognised tonight, Bangladeshi people across the country are more likely than any other ethnic minority group to be involved in local decision-making bodies. In other words, Bangladeshi people are asking, not what their local area can do for them, but what they can do for their local area. Commitment like that - that readiness to get involved - is always to be applauded, and has never been more vital than today.

> ""British Bangladeshis will continue to be an important part of the fabric of this country and it's a pleasure to celebrate today the outstanding achievements of the community"".

The event marked the launch of this year's edition of the British Bangladeshi Who's Who publication. Appearing as Chief Guest at the launch, Mr Pickles spoke alongside Rushanara Ali, the first ever MP of Bangladeshi origin, and the Bangladeshi High Commissioner, Dr M Sayedur Rahman Khan.

The Who's Who lists around 200 successful British Bangladeshis and a small number were picked out to receive awards for their exceptional work. Those receiving awards included Abdul Gaffar Choudhury for his outstanding achievements in journalism and literature and Sir Fazle Hasan Abed for Outstanding International Contribution, for his work in tackling poverty and empowering the poor, especially in Bangladesh.

### Notes to editors

1. The British Bangladeshi Who's Who is published by British Bangla Media Group. This is the third year of the annual publication, which focuses on British Bangladeshi's support for the economy and highlights individual accomplishment, contributions and achievements, as well as the success of the community as a whole.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1781896,Eric Pickles celebrates faiths working in harmony,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has hosted a reception during Inter Faith Week to recognise the contribution of faith based social action and the merits of collaboration between faiths.

Speaking at the reception, which was attended by local faith-based activists, Mr Pickles likened faiths working together to different voice parts singing in harmony - all are striving for the same goal, each component strengthened by the others, but it is their differences which make it work so well.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Inter Faith Week is the perfect opportunity to celebrate the fantastic practical work of faith communities - and also to recognise that it's when they pull together in a shared endeavour that they can make the biggest difference in their community.
> 
> ""Collaboration builds stronger understanding and helps people to concentrate on the values they hold in common - without ever losing their unique strengths.""

As well as aiming to strengthen bonds between people of different faiths, Inter Faith Week also seeks to increase understanding and collaboration between people of religious and non-religious beliefs.

The Rt Revd Dr Alastair Redfern and Dr Manazir Ahsan, co-chairs of the Inter Faith Network for the UK, said:

> ""Good inter faith relations and practical cooperation between different faith communities are vital to the wellbeing of our society. Inter Faith Week shines a light on the rich possibilities of mutual engagement and offers a chance for encounter, learning and practical engagement.""

Other events taking place across the country during Inter Faith Week are predominantly locally focussed, organised by and for people living near one another. They include shared meals, debates, arts festivals and exchange visits to places of worship.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell, also at the reception, attended a number of these local community inter faith events during the week.

During the week, Mr Pickles will attend an event to promote youth volunteering in community projects on Monday 22 November, as well as the Church of England's main event of the week - an inter faith event to coincide with the opening of the General Synod - on Tuesday 23 November.

Inter Faith Week is about locally focussed events, organised by and for people living near one another. Events are taking place around the country and include shared meals, arts festivals and exchange visits to places of worship.

Eric Pickles will also host a national reception on Thursday 25 November, providing an opportunity for Government ministers, faith leaders and local activists to forge new links and consolidate areas of common ground. Speaking at the event, Mr Pickles is expected to recognise the importance of inter faith cooperation and encourage as many people as possible to get involved in events in their area.

Eric Pickles said:

> 
> ""Inter Faith Week shines a light on the rich possibilities of mutual engagement and offers a chance for encounter, learning and practical engagement. We are delighted that hundreds of organisations, such as faith groups, schools and institutions of further and higher education, local authorities and emergency services are planning events.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2091532,Eric Pickles gives councils back the freedom to pray,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today (18 February 2012) gave local councils a major new power that will allow town halls to continue to hold prayers.

Local councils now have a power that should enable them to continue to include prayers as part of the formal business at council meetings, if they wish, and thereby maintain the common practice in council meetings across the country.

This responds to last week's High Court ruling against Bideford Town Council based on an interpretation of Section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972 rather than on equality or human rights grounds. It judged that councils did not have the powers to hold prayers as part of formal business.

This major new legal power is contained in the Coalition Government's Localism Act 2011, which creates a 'general power of competence' that will allow councils to legally do anything an individual could do unless specifically prohibited by law. This should give councils that want to continue holding formal prayers the confidence and legal standing to do so.

Mr Pickles has fast-tracked and personally signed a Parliamentary Commencement Order so the new power can be exercised by all major local authorities in England from today and following due Parliamentary process for parishes by April.

Today's intervention builds on the speech by the Prime Minister in Christ Church, Oxford, in December, where he asserted: ""We are a Christian country and we should not be afraid to say so"". It also follows the official Ministerial delegation to the Holy See this week led by Cabinet Minister, Baroness Warsi; in her speech, she criticised the intolerance of ""militant secularisation"".

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""The High Court judgement has far wider significance than just the municipal agenda of Bideford Town Council. For too long, faith has been marginalised in public life, undermining the very foundations of the British nation.
> 
> ""As a matter of urgency I have personally signed a Parliamentary order to bring into force an important part of the new Localism Act - the general power of competence - that gives councils the vital legal standing that should allow them to continue to hold formal prayers at meetings where they wish to do so.
> 
> ""This should effectively overtake the ruling and it also shows that greater localism can give local councils the strength and freedom to act in their best interests.
> 
> ""We will stand for freedom to worship, for Parliamentary sovereignty, and for long-standing British liberties.""

### Notes to Editors

  1. The Coalition Government's Localism Act 2011 contains a new general power of competence that gives local authorities the legal capacity to do anything that an individual can do that is not specifically prohibited (they will not, for example, be able to ban or tax things, as an individual has no powers to do this). It gives councils more freedom to work together with others in new ways to drive down costs. It gives them increased confidence to do creative, innovative things to meet local people's needs. Councils have asked for this power because it will help them get on with the job. Instead of being able to act only where the law says they can, local authorities will be free to do anything - provided it does not break any other laws. It does not remove any duties from local authorities - just like individuals they will continue to need to comply with duties placed on them.
  2. The general power of competence can now be used by 'principal local authorities' (London boroughs, the Isles of Scilly as well as all County, District, Metropolitan and Unitary authorities). A draft Order that will apply the general power to parish councils which meet the conditions set out in an Order that is currently before Parliament and it is hoped that this will be approved by April (that Order has to follow an 'Affirmative Resolution' procedure, requiring a vote in both Houses of Parliament). In the meantime informal advice on how parish councils can still hold prayers in their council chamber is being issued by Department for Communities for Local Government while ministers consider what further steps may be necessary.
  3. The provisions do not apply to local authorities in Wales, as the Welsh Assembly Government declined the offer of Coalition Government to include Welsh local authorities in the general power of competence. However, the Welsh Assembly does have the power to legislate in this area. 
  4. The order also brings into effect wider powers for English Fire and Rescue Authorities, Integrated Transport Authorities, Passenger Transport Executives Combined Authorities and Economic Prosperity Boards. The Welsh Assembly Government has decided that Welsh fire and rescue authorities will not have access to the power until April 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1822578,Eric Pickles hears local ideas for economic revival,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles visited Birmingham to listen to local ideas from the business sector about stimulating and sustaining economic growth locally.

The Government sees businesses playing a vital role in kick-starting local economies and in helping to create areas that are vibrant and prosperous places to live.

One example of the Government's commitment to growth is through local enterprise partnerships - dynamic joint ventures between local authorities and business that puts them firmly back in charge of their local economies.

Ministers believe that by pushing power away from Whitehall, the Government is giving local democratic leaders and business the opportunity to decide how to grow their local area for themselves, and in doing so help rebalance the national economy.

As part of the visit Mr Pickles toured Cleone Foods Factory in Hockley, a great example of local economic success, which employs 50 people and sells its products all over the country. He also spoke to local business leaders who are leading a community project to help retailers be better corporate citizens at local level.

The meeting was also attended by the Birmingham and Solihull, and the Black Country local enterprise partnerships. The Government approved both partnerships last year. They are now gearing up to drive forward and deliver many of the local ideas for economic renewal that were discussed.

Eric Pickles, Communities Secretary said:

> ""Birmingham is a world city as important as Boston or Barcelona. Today, I have heard at first hand the ideas of local business who are already stepping up to the plate to foster local economic growth.
> 
> ""Prosperity in local business goes hand in hand with prosperity in local economies and the wider community. Through Local Enterprise Partnerships the people who have the knowledge about what is best for the area and how best to achieve local growth are being given the reins to rebalance growth from the ground up.""

In addition to this, the Government has unveiled plans to devolve even greater powers to the localities to drive economic growth in its plans to allow councils to keep the business rates they collect locally, giving councils renewed incentive to attract business to the area.

A £1.4bn Regional Growth Fund has been set up to support communities currently dependent on the public sector, helping them make the transition to private sector led prosperity.

The £500million Centenary Quay development is being built on the site of the former Vosper Thornycroft shipyard in Woolston. Alongside 1,600 new homes, of which more than 400 will be available to buy at an affordable price, the new site will also include a library, supermarket and a hotel, as well as bars and restaurants.  
   


> ""I am delighted to have laid the foundations for this exciting and extensive development on the Centenary Quay in Southampton.""

The project is expected to create more than 1,000 new jobs for the area.

Speaking at the site, Mr Pickles set out a comprehensive range of measures the Government has taken to get Britain building again.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""I am delighted to have laid the foundations for this exciting and extensive development on the Centenary Quay. The work started here will not only lead to more than 400 new affordable homes, it will also mean a new library, supermarket, bars and restaurants for Southampton residents.
> 
> ""But for every new development like this, there are communities across the country in desperate need of new and affordable housing in their area.
> 
> ""That's why even though we are making efforts to cut the record budget deficit we have confirmed £1.25billion to guarantee most of the unfunded spending commitments made by the previous administration.
> 
> ""This alone will protect over 8,000 jobs, and will mean work can start on 9,500 new social homes and 3,000 homes for sale at affordable prices.""

### Government measures to boost housebuilding

Housebuilding is currently at its lowest level than for any peacetime year since 1924. Since May, the Government has set out a range of measures to boost this. These include:

  * Scrapping regional housing targets, with plans to introduce new homes bonuses to encourage councils to approve new developments in their area
  * Securing £1.25billion of the previous administration's £1.5billion Housing Pledge, despite the lack of sustainable funding and a massive government budget deficit
  * Outlining plans for a new Right to Build, which will enable rural communities to set up local housing trusts and grant themselves planning permission for small numbers of new homes - subject to overwhelming public support expressed in a local referendum.

One of the new councillors he met at the event at City Hall on Thursday 1 July was James Bond, an independent councillor for Harrow.

The reception was organised by the London Assembly and London Councils to welcome members to their role, show how the organisations can work together and enable the councillors to meet others from across London.

Addressing the new councillors Eric Pickles, said:

> ""Whatever your politics this is the most exciting time to be in local government. For too long central government treated local government like a lapdog: feeding it scraps with one hand, while keeping it on a tight leash with the other. That's not how our relationship is going to work. I have too much respect for local government for that. I trust you - the councillors - to make right decisions for your community. We can build a Big Society and make localism a reality.
> 
> ""I want to see double devolution, not just transferring power from central government to local authorities, but for power to transfer down to individuals and communities.
> 
> ""I say to you as new councillors - don't hang around waiting for instructions from central government. The opportunities for you to exercise real power, make real decisions, make a real difference in your community are there for the taking.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1855041,Eric Pickles outlines action plan to support the voluntary and community sector,"Community groups, local residents and voluntary sector organisations will benefit from powerful new rights designed to transform the way that local services are run, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today, as he outlined the action Government is taking to ensure that the most is made of the energy, expertise and experience of the voluntary sector.

Speaking at the National Council of Voluntary Organisations conference the Communities Secretary outlined the measures in the Localism Bill, including community rights to buy local assets and run local services that are designed to make it easier for community groups to make a real difference to their local areas.

The Communities Secretary also used the speech to praise those councils that have recognised that voluntary and community groups could hold the key to better value and better services when setting their budgets. But he accused those councils that are failing to engage the sector of ""short sightedness.""

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Councils have challenging decisions to make around how they prioritise spending but they must resist any temptation to pull up the drawbridge on the voluntary sector and pass on disproportionate cuts. The best councils are showing that they can both embrace the Big Society and balance the books at the same time. They are doing that without government dictating their every action through intervention and ring fencing.
> 
> ""This is about moving from a situation where voluntary sector is surviving to one where they can thrive. Making this a reality will require councils to be more imaginative and the voluntary sector to be more independent.
> 
> ""In their approach to budget setting, the best councils are showing that they understand that a strong, thriving voluntary sector is more important now than ever and could be the key to providing high quality, good value services to their residents. But this is not the case everywhere. Councils that are failing to recognise the importance of the sector are being short sighted in their approach.  
   
""Through the Big Society we want to make sure that voluntary and community groups have got the confidence, the clout and the power to match their experience and expertise. We are putting into law new powerful rights that will mean that when groups have a track record of delivering and can show that they have good ideas about the way things should be done then  the council will have to take them seriously.""

At the heart of the Localism Bill is a suite of measures designed to strengthen the hand of groups wanting to take on a bigger role by entrenching powerful new rights for community groups, these include:

  * The community right to buy community resources like leisure centres and libraries - groups will have the time they need to develop business plans and raise funds. This crucial breathing space will ensure that they are not squeezed out of open market sales of treasured local assets.
  * The community right to challenge the way local services are run such as children's centres, social care, or even transport. Voluntary and community groups that have a track record of working with their community and delivering results will have the chance to show what they can do. The new right will put them on the front foot when it comes to taking over a local service and has the potential to open up new funding streams.

The Secretary of State also used his speech to urge councils to think carefully about how budget setting decisions now will impact on the voluntary sector.

  * Involving voluntary and community groups in budget setting - as councils set their budgets it is reasonable to expect that they give voluntary and community groups three months notice or more when they think they need to end or alter a grant, or other support. Rather than pulling up the drawbridge they should, as a matter of course, be open to suggestions from these groups on alternative ways of redesigning or reshaping the services so that they can continue to be provided even where budgets need to be reduced. In the speech the Secretary of State made clear that where there is a failure on the part of councils to engage in these discussions Ministers will not shy away from using statutory force to make sure that voluntary groups are getting a fair crack at the whip.

Government is also supporting local groups take centre stage in the running of local services and move towards ending the dependency on grant funding.

  * £1m to support takeover of local assets - Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark has today boosted the support, advice and expertise that will be available to groups that want to take on community assets such as youth centres, museums and former town halls, and give them a new lease of life.
  * Transparency in funding - as part of efforts to increase transparency in local government, ministers have urged all councils publish what they give in grants and payments to the voluntary and community Sector.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Many voluntary and community groups have outstanding ideas about how they could deliver high quality local services at a reasonable cost, or run the local buildings and amenities that people care about in the best interests of the community.
> 
> ""We want to make it as easy as possible for local groups to feel empowered to make these changes, and give buildings, parks, and other much-loved community assets a new lease of life.
> 
> ""The Asset Transfer Unit's specialist teams are experts at this, and today's boost in funding will allow them to offer support and advice to many more groups across the country.""

### Notes to editors

1. Many 'can do' councils are actively working to protect voluntary organisations as they make decisions about future funding:

  * Thurrock and Wolverhampton have all pledged to continue funding the voluntary sector at the same rates.

  * Wiltshire have said that they need flourishing voluntary sector organisations today more than ever before and that ""to weaken the sector by withdrawing support would be a big mistake"".

  * Reading are increasing the money they give to voluntary groups. And changing the way it's distributed so it's more transparent, consistent, and focused on what the town needs and they are offering hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of cheap accommodation taking some of the financial pressure off local groups.

2. DCLG are extending funding for the Asset Transfer Unit by £1m into 2011-12 enabling the unit to continue to offer practical support to communities who want to take on public assets such as youth centres, museums and former town halls for the benefit of local people. The Asset Transfer Unit has a unique understanding and extensive experience in this area, having supported approximately 1,000 transfer initiatives to help them take on buildings and services to generate income and therefore a more sustainable, less grant dependant future. The Asset Transfer Unit is managed by the Development Trusts Association who are soon to merge with Bassac to form 'Locality'. Further information can be found on the ATU website [www.atu.org.uk](http://www.atu.org.uk/) (external link). Details on the extended funding for the ATU and pilot projects will be announced shortly.

3. Greg Clark recently wrote to councils highlighting the importance of publishing details of funding to voluntary and community groups as part and parcel of the general move towards greater transparency in public spending. Making the data public will help highlight inefficiency and open new markets for local small businesses and voluntary groups by revealing how services are currently delivered so they can assess whether they could submit a credible bid to run them differently and deliver greater value for money.

Speaking at the event organised by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Secretary of State emphasised how important it is that everyone understands the relevance of the Holocaust to our lives today, and lit a candle to symbolise remembrance.

Mr Pickles also confirmed that Government support for local memorial activities will continue, with £1.5m funding over the next two years.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Holocaust Memorial Day gives us an opportunity to find out more about what happened in Nazi Germany, Bosnia, Cambodia, Rwanda and Darfur; to look at why it happened; and to think about what we all need to do to make sure it never happens again. This day is relevant to all of us.
> 
> ""Antisemitism and other forms of bigotry have sadly not yet been relegated to the history books. It's the responsibility of every one of us to challenge divisive views and discrimination whenever we see them.
> 
> ""Holocaust Memorial Day is such an important focus for motivating people to do their bit to ensure that the horrendous crimes committed during the Holocaust are remembered and never repeated. This is why we have decided to continue to provide funding to support the crucial work of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.
> 
> ""Formal events are a chance to stop and remember the horrific genocides of this century. But the many local events taking place this week, in whatever form they take, provide even more important opportunities for the whole community to get involved. They rightly focus on education, young people, thought-provoking stories and active engagement with the modern day issues.""

The Government supports the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust to supply resources for teachers and for the organisers of the hundreds of local events that take place in communities.

The Trust is also encouraging people to visit their website and light a virtual candle to show their support (see link, top right). The site includes an array of free resources and information as well as details of events taking place in every region.

The remembrance event at the Royal Horticultural Halls in London brought together survivors, youth groups and human rights activists and provided a national focus for activity on the day.

Communities Ministers also attended the Holocaust Education Trust's reception and the Mayor's event at City Hall.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2146509,Eric Pickles pays tribute to 'best of British' pubs,"Minister outlines government support ahead of summer of celebration

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today paid tribute to the 'Great British pub' in a [speech](http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/appgbeerawards2012) that highlighted the Government's continued support to the sector.

Speaking at the All Party Parliamentary Beer Groups' annual awards, Mr Pickles encouraged the industry to recognise the opportunities ahead. He emphasised the Government support helping pubs get in 'the shape of their life' in anticipation of  'a triple whammy' of festivity this summer, bringing punters new and old down to the local to share in the celebrations.

Pubs make a huge contribution to communities and the country, not just to our heritage, and social lives but to the economy. Pubs collectively add £19 billion to the national economy and provide 900,000 jobs. With the Diamond Jubilee, Olympics and European Championships fast approaching the Minister highlighted how the Great British pub can expect even more opportunities to get business booming.

The Government are determined to help support community pubs to thrive in the long-term making sure that they can continue to play a fundamental role in communities for years to come.

The Communities Secretary made clear the Government's continued commitment to cutting restrictive red tape and knocking down bureaucratic barriers that have held back community pubs.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Nothing says Britain more than our Great British pubs and our Great British beer. Pubs and brewing are part of our social and cultural heritage but they are also playing a fundamental role in our present.
> 
> ""Just as pubs are at the heart of communities we are giving communities the chance to get involved at the very heart of their local, enabling them to make their bids to ensure that these social and economic hubs continue to thrive.
> 
> ""We are determined to give our community pubs the support to help get them in the shape of their lives to get business booming not just in this summer of celebration but in the years to come.""

The Government has already introduced a series of measures to support thriving community pubs including:

  * doubling small business rate relief from £6,000 to £12,000 until March 2013 and ensuring rural rate relief is available to public houses

  * enabling councils to introduce further business rates discounts to support local businesses, through powers handed to them in the Localism Act

  * introducing a minimum unit price preventing supermarkets from unfair sales of alcohol below cost-price and put an end to the so-called cider-tax

  * through the Community Right to Buy, the Department is giving residents the power to save struggling local pubs by taking them over rather than seeing them empty and derelict

  * making it easier for pubs to have live music, taking away the usual licensing rules from performances where the audience numbers 200 or fewer.

Speaking at the 2010 British Curry Awards, Mr Pickles paid tribute to the contribution that the spice industry makes to both the national economy and the local community.

Now in their sixth year, and a highlight of the gastronomic calendar, the British Curry Awards celebrates the best of Britain's favourite dishes and restaurants.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Curry has a huge place in our national affections. The tikka masala is more British than fish and chips. And curry is big business as well as a great meal. The entrepreneurial spirit shown by those present is a real inspiration. The growth in the spice industry over recent years is a modern day success story and is testament to the hard work of those running these restaurants - as well as their cooking.""

Mr Pickles is a well known curry fan. Earlier this year, he was pictured in one of Birmingham's most popular curry restaurants, prompting a significant pay out by Ladbrokes bookmakers.

Reflecting on the Prime Minister's visit to India earlier this year, Mr Pickles stressed the importance of building up strong economic and cultural links with India. Closer to home, he promised to work constructively with the industry on all the relevant issues - from skills and small business rate relief to bin collections.

The awards, organised by Enam and Justine Ali, took place at Grosvenor House. There were 3500 different restaurants who received more than 67,000 nominations from listeners to LBC radio and viewers of STAR TV and ITN. The winners were chosen by food critics, journalists and celebrity chefs.

There are now 12,000 Indian restaurants all over the UK and Ireland with an annual turnover of £4.2 billion yearly and directly employing around 100,000 people. The event was raising funds for the Help a London Child fund.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1634489,Eric Pickles pledges to end mismanagement of European funding,"The Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles MP, today pledged to end the mismanagement of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

The Communities and Local Government accounts for last year, laid today, show the extent of the financial irregularities in the administration of the ERDF by the previous Government. The failure to ensure compliance with EC rules has left a bill for more than £150 million to be picked up by taxpayers.

The ERDF money is allocated by the EC to help fund schemes like the Eden Project in Cornwall, the Millennium Bridge in Gateshead, and to provide grants to small businesses. In all, £3.8 billion of ERDF has been spent in England from the 2000-2006 round of programmes.

EC Auditors found instances where projects allegedly failed to keep proper records or used the funding inappropriately. The Department is challenging these issues robustly. But where there is no convincing case, the EC will impose financial penalties on the Government for these failures of monitoring and, where the misspent funds can't be recovered from projects, the taxpayer has to bear the loss.

The Communities Secretary said:

> ""I am publishing our accounts today so that taxpayers can see where their money is being spent.
> 
> ""ERDF is governed by complicated and over-bureaucratic rules drawn up by the EC, but that does not excuse the mistakes that have been made and the failure to manage properly the use of public funds.
> 
> ""The 'financial irregularities' which have been reported mean that we are likely to need to find up to £155 million to pay back to Europe.
> 
> ""This mismanagement ends now.
> 
> ""I am urgently reviewing how we manage and distribute these funds to make sure taxpayers have confidence that their money is not being wasted. And I will be pressing the EC Commissioner about the needless bureaucracy which holds up the money from being spent to kick start the recovery in Britain.""

### Notes to editors

1. The European Regional Development Fund was set up in 1975 to stimulate economic growth in the least prosperous regions of the European Union (EU). As EU membership has grown, the ERDF has developed into a major instrument for helping to redress regional imbalances. CLG manages overall ERDF in England and the Government Office network was responsible for delivering the 2000-2006 round of projects in their regions. The current round of ERDF (2007-2013) is being delivered by Regional Development Agencies.

2. The Department for Communities and Local Government accounts laid today (7 July 2010) are for the year to 31 March 2010.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1789263,Eric Pickles praises Big Society snow angels and gritty determination from communities,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has praised people's efforts and neighbourly support in the cold weather this week and applauded the Big Society spirit from local councils and communities.

In guidance issued today, Mr Pickles also called on councils and other local organisations to avoid icy bureaucracy getting in the way of community action, and reminded people that they would not be subject to legal action under health and safety laws if they used common sense to clear a pavement or help grit a path.

During the recent cold spell, major disruption has been caused and conditions have been tough but hundreds of people and organisations have swung into action to help others through kind support.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""There should be no barriers getting in the way of community action. I want to send out a strong message that clearing a path and helping your neighbours should no longer be subject to icy bureaucracy and health and safety zealotry. Common sense is now the order of the day.
> 
> ""In this cold snap, the values of the Big Society are more important than ever. Thousands of people have stepped up for their community. Parents swept the paths so that children could get to school safely. Volunteers in mountain rescue teams worked round the clock to help the stranded. People checked in on elderly neighbours, did their shopping or visited the library for them. We should celebrate that community spirit.""

### Notes to editors

1. DCLG has today reissued guidance that challenges misconceptions about health and safety laws getting in the way of action and volunteering. It also contains contacts for useful charities such as the Red Cross for vulnerable people, and tips on how to volunteer [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/severeweatherguidance](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/severeweatherguidance).

2. Local initiatives such as free shovel schemes in Camden are proving a success, where neighbours are encouraged to pass the shovel on next door once they have finished clearing their driveway.

3. The London Borough of Sutton, also a Big Society vanguard, is giving away free bags of grit for local people. So far, thousands of people have taken up the offer and helped clear the way with council workers, keeping paths clear so help can reach the most vulnerable people and shops can stay open.

4. Durham County Council have enlisted the support of farmers who hold winter maintenance contracts to help clear other areas and have redeployed staff from certain normal duties to help clear snow from pavements in high priority areas.

5. In Newcastle, the Council has produced tips for driving in hazardous conditions created by snow and ice. Examples of these include: carrying a car kit in your vehicle, which contains waterproof clothes, a torch and spade, mobile phone charger and emergency contact list for instance; telling family and friends about your travel plans; making sure your car has adequate visibility by clearing front and back windscreens and all windows/wing mirrors before setting off; and checking on older friends and neighbours, making sure they are warm and safe. To avoid doubt, the Council has also made clear that residents are entitled to clear the snow from their own driveways.

More generally, the Council's actions in the face of current weather conditions are part of its vision for a 'Resilient Newcastle'. This vision includes plans for sustaining communities during major incidents, as well as encouraging local businesses and voluntary agencies to prepare to continue operating during times of crisis or recover effectively following disruption.

6. A community in Nenthead in Cumbria have clubbed together and bought and are now running a snowplough, with the assistance of Cumbria County Council.

7. HMRC have also issued guidance clarifying that any vehicle being used to clear snow from public roads by means of a snow plough or similar device is entitled to use red diesel. The law in relation to gritting is that in order to be entitled to use red diesel the vehicle has to be constructed or adapted solely for the conveyance of machinery for spreading material on roads to deal with frost and snow. HMRC recognise the vital role played by farmers in helping to keep rural roads clear. They will exercise an element of discretion, taking into account the exceptionally severe weather.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1700532,Eric Pickles praises Halton for joining the recycling reward trend,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today praised Halton Borough Council, in Runcorn and Widnes, for being the first northern council to adopt recycling rewards.

Halton's voluntary recycling scheme, which started off as a pilot, lets residents earn points for recycling which can be spent in local shops and restaurants. Residents can earn up to £135 worth of points a year from over 120 reward partners, at no other cost to residents. Mr Pickles believes this is the right way to encourage households to recycle waste.

The Halton scheme, the first in the North of England, will now be extended to 47,000 residents. During the six-month trial period residents recycled 60 per cent more and collected a total of 6 million reward points. The council plan to extend it to a further 9,000 more residents in 2011.

> ""By adopting this common sense approach to recycling Halton council is leading the way proving that carrots really do work better than sticks.""

In June, Environment Ministers axed the funding for pilot schemes for 'bin taxes.' Bin tax schemes would have allowed local councils to charge residents for household rubbish collections or fine families for having a full bin. Ministers believe they promoted a culture of 'bin bullying' and fuelled fly-tipping to dodge fines. Under the scrapped bin tax laws, once introduced pilot schemes could be rolled out nationally without a substantive vote in Parliament.

In line with the Government's commitment to greener cleaner communities Mr Pickles has also withdrawn Audit Commission guidance encouraging councils to switch to fortnightly collections and laid out plans to remove the bin tax laws from the statute books.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The first recycling reward scheme in the North of England is great news for all residents in Halton and good for the environment.
> 
> ""By adopting this common sense approach to recycling Halton council is leading the way proving that carrots really do work better than sticks.
> 
> ""The best way to encourage people to recycle is not to punish families, but to encourage and reward them for going green. It's time to rein in the bin bullies and work with local people to build greener and cleaner communities.""

Councillor Stef Nelson of Halton Borough Council said:

> ""The scheme brings benefits to the whole community in Halton. As well as providing rewards to residents, local businesses can benefit from increased custom which provides a welcome boost to the borough's economy. We believe this scheme is a win-win for all concerned and we are delighted to be able to offer the scheme to even more residents.""

Halton council is the second English council to go for a reward scheme. In June the Local Government and Environment Secretaries visited Windsor and Maidenhead the first council to adopt this pioneering approach to recycling.

He joined Home Secretary Theresa May, Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt and Cabinet Office Minister Baroness Warsi, in recognising the significant contribution British Muslims make to this country and in praising the huge efforts in response to the floods in Pakistan.

During the Foreign and Commonwealth Office reception held at Durbar Court, co-hosted by Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles took the opportunity to meet British Muslims to thank them for their support and pass on good wishes for Eid.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""The messages of compassion, giving and justice are strong in the Islamic faith. And this period of Ramadan and Eid, in particular, inspires Muslims to focus more on others than themselves and think about those who are less fortunate.
> 
> ""Each day, thousands of Muslims - as well, of course, as Christians, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs and Humanists - are inspired by their beliefs to quietly make a huge difference. In many ways, these communities exemplify the Big Society principles - the desire to make things better, the sense of collective responsibility, the degree of neighbourliness, and the practical skills to get things done.
> 
> ""So I want to express my thanks for everything you do as individuals and as a community and wish you all a belated Eid Mubarak.""

Eid al-Fitr, which this year fell on 9 September, is a three-day festival to mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. It is traditionally a time for sharing and many Muslims celebrate the festival with their families.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1875618,Eric Pickles predicts public service shake up as community budgets begin,"Local areas having a single pot of funding to spend on local problems are key to the future for public services and spending, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

Mr Pickles confirmed at a conference on Community Budgets today that the first 16 pioneers would be up and running come the 1st April 2011. The first Community Budgets pool and align various national and local funding strands into a single local funding pot for tackling social problems around families with complex needs.

The most troubled families can cost central and local agencies up to £330,000 a year. Children from these families are much more likely to excluded from school, taken into care or get into trouble with the police. Their parents are often affected by drug and alcohol problems, domestic violence and poor housing. The first 16 Community Budgets pilots will look to bring local agencies together to get straight to the heart of the problems facing some of the country's most chaotic families. They expect to help at least 10,000 families by 2015.

Mr Pickles said that communities need to be trusted with their own money to target their own problems. He confirmed that work would continue to develop bigger Community Budgets that cover more local public spending and more problems as part of the Coalition Government's plans to restore financial independence to local communities. The second phase of the Local Government Resource Review, commencing this month, will focus on broadening community budgets as they continue to be rolled out across the country.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""It's about time Whitehall started trusting local communities. And local agencies started trusting each other. What better way to make services work together than by putting all the money in one place? A single pot of local funding that can be targeted straight at the frontline.
> 
> ""Until now money from the centre has always come with strict caveats. At Whitehall we are going to step back and let local councils and agencies get re-animated about local problems. With Community Budgets we want to get as close as possible to the idea that councils and local areas should get a single pot of local funding from Government to spend as they see fit.
> 
> ""My message to local areas is don't be afraid to think big. To be as bold and as innovative as you can. This is the future for public services. If we can get 16 areas up and running in less than six months think what we can achieve moving forward.
> 
> ""I want all areas to be able to tackle problem families and other key local priorities through community budgets from 2013. For too long we've handed out pocket money to local agencies and told them how to spend like an overbearing parent. It's time to let local areas grow up and do things their way.""

Mr Pickles said the Government would continue to break down barriers and deliver the flexibilities local areas needed to deliver their ambitions. The first Community Budgets will be able to focus on all issues faced by families rather than treat each one in isolation by pooling local resources and know how. The council, local police, social services, Job centres, schools and housing groups will work together as one so families are no longer bounced between a myriad of programmes and professionals.

In the Islington pilot, where almost half of local children live in poverty, local agencies will pool over £6 million of resources and staff to provide intensive support. A new Family Outreach Support Service will be able to support a thousand families at any one time giving them one point of contact.

Swindon have already brought together professionals from the housing sector, the police, the NHS and adults' and children's services to work intensively with 12 families with persistent problems. They believe this work could save over £1.5 million in two years. Swindon's Community Budget now aims to reach 350 families by 2015 by increasing the reach of this programme.

This approach is part of the overall re-design of public services in Swindon as they plan to reduce costs by 26 per cent by 2014.

Ministers believe Community Budgets will help drive down overhead costs by removing the bureaucratic financial restrictions that have generated waste and duplication in public spending. Local areas will be able to redesign and integrate frontline services across organisations and share management functions to reduce running costs for the best local outcomes.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1632278,Eric Pickles puts stop to flawed regional strategies today,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles is today putting a swift end to Whitehall's grip on local planning policy by scrapping Regional Strategies and their centrally imposed building targets that failed to increase housebuilding.

Regional targets intended to build 3 million homes nationally by 2020 were put in place by the previous Government despite fears that they would force councils to cut into the Greenbelt. However, the reality is that construction has slowed down so much the country is facing the lowest peacetime housebuilding rates since 1924.

A statement laid in parliament today will revoke Regional Strategies with immediate effect. Councils will now have the freedom to prepare their local plans without having to follow top-down targets from regional quangos and bureaucrats that prescribe exactly what, where and when to build.

Mr Pickles also pledged that direct and substantial benefits for councils who support construction would be the centrepiece of this radical restoration of local power. The money will be used to help ensure more new homes are built for local people, and matched with more new jobs and investment.

From today, power will be handed back to councils and communities to make their own decisions on planning that can get the country building again. Communities will, once again, be able to solve local housing challenges in a way that makes sense for them. In return councils will be offered powerful new incentives that ensure they benefit from development they welcome.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Communities will no longer have to endure the previous government's failed Soviet tractor style top-down planning targets - they were a terrible, expensive, time-consuming way to impose house building and worst of all threatened the destruction of the Green Belt.
> 
> ""I promised to get rid of them and today I'm revoking regional plans with immediate effect - hammering another nail in the coffin of unwanted and an unaccountable regional bureaucracy. They were a national disaster that robbed local people of their democratic voice, alienating them and entrenching opposition against new development.
> 
> ""Regional Strategies built nothing but resentment - we want to build houses. So instead we will introduce powerful new incentives for local people so they support the construction of new homes in the right places and receive direct rewards from the proceeds of growth to improve their local area.""

Mr Pickles made the announcement in a keynote speech to the Local Government Association conference where he told Town Halls they were back in charge of local affairs.

Councils will now be free to protect Green Belt surrounding 30 towns across the country. The targets system forced them to redraw Green Belt boundaries and designate large areas of countryside for new development. Communities will now have the power to prevent encroachment on the Green Belt and decide themselves where they want to build.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Today is another significant step in the Coalition Government's drive to transfer powers from remote bureaucracies to local communities. Regional edicts, which allowed communities no say, injected poison into the planning system which stymied development. By allowing communities to shape their neighbourhoods and to share in the benefits, we are beginning to restore the idea that development can be a force for good, rather than something to be resisted at all costs.""

### Notes to editors

1. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles confirmed today in a Written Parliamentary Statement that Regional Strategies will be revoked with immediate effect, as set out in the Coalition Agreement. In the longer term the legal basis for Regional Strategies will be abolished through the Localism Bill that will be introduced in the current Parliamentary session. A copy of the written statement can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/regionalstrategies](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/regionalstrategies).

2. Regional Strategies have been revoked through Section 79 (6) of The 2009 Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act. Accompanying the Parliamentary Statement is guidance for Local Authorities that covers the period between the  revocation of Regional Strategies and legislation to abolish them altogether. A copy of the statement and guidance can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/letterregionalstrategies](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/letterregionalstrategies).

3. The abolition of regional strategies provides a clear signal of the importance attached to the development and application of local spatial plans, in the form of Local Development Framework Core Strategies and Development Plan Documents. Local plans drawn up with the help of the community will become the basis for local planning decisions, and future reform will make it easier for local councils to agree and amend local plans with their local community, in a way that maximises the involvement of neighbourhoods. The introduction of incentives to replace building targets will be a top priority for the new Government and take place early in the spending review.

4. Towns and areas that were planning to make Green Belt cuts and reviews because of Whitehall-imposed targets will now be able to make their own decisions where new development is built. They include: Bath, Bedworth, Bournemouth, Bristol, Bromsgrove, Broxbourne, Cheltenham, Chertsey, Coventry, Gloucester, Guildford, Harlow, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead, Leeds, Lichfield, Maidenhead, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Nottingham, Nuneaton, Oxford, Redditch, Redhill, Reigate, Rushcliffe, Stevenage, Solihull, Tunbridge Wells, Welwyn, and Woking and Worcester and in West Yorkshire beyond Leeds.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2146764,Eric Pickles' reforms offer potential £10 billion boost to economy,"New law before Parliament shows growth agenda on course, says Minister

Government plans to allow councils to retain more of the money they raise from business rates could boost the economy by an estimated ten billion pounds, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

As Members of Parliament prepare to debate a key part of the Government's growth agenda and its legislative plans for this Parliamentary session, new economic analysis research reveals the potential benefits of giving greater financial incentives to councils that support local firms and local jobs.

The local growth reforms are part of the Local Government Finance Bill that will have its third reading in the House of Commons next week. The Bill was not directly mentioned in the Queen's Speech because it was 'carried over' from the previous legislative session.

The Bill seeks to create a new incentive for local government across England to support growth by directly linking a council's financial revenue to the decisions they take to back local firms and local jobs. Councils will be able to keep 50 per cent of their business rates, providing a strong incentive to go for growth.

A set of papers on key aspects of the Local Government Finance Bill have been published today. Departmental analysis shows that the projected economic benefits of the new business rate retention scheme could add an additional £10 billion to national Gross Domestic Product over the next seven years.

The new system will be fair and equitable for all areas with protections for vulnerable or less prosperous areas. Business rate growth would be shared evenly between central and local government. The 'local share' would be retained in full by councils and would be set at 50 per cent for the seven year period. The full 'central share' will always be returned in grants to local government.

In addition councils would get to keep 100 per cent business rates from new renewable energy projects. These would not count against the local-central shares.

A centrally run safety net fund would provide support should a council's income drop below a set baseline, protecting areas which suffer a downturn.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles, said:

> ""The current flawed system of government handouts to local authorities encourages a begging bowl mentality, with each council vying to be more deprived than its neighbour. Our reforms will allow councils to stand tall, and reward them for supporting local jobs and local firms. All councils, including the least prosperous, have the opportunity to gain from this system.
> 
> ""These new laws and reforms deliver an opportunity for a £10 billion boost to the wider economy, and more business rate revenues for councils. Councils will have a strong incentive to go for growth, generating more money to support frontline services, help pay off the deficit and still protect vulnerable communities.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Local Government Finance Bill is major step towards two of the Government's major priorities: putting power back into local hands and creating the conditions for economic growth. The Bill has had extensive consultation with local authorities, professional bodies as well as revenue and benefits professionals. The technical documents being published today cover:

**Business rates retention** - to strengthen the incentive for councils to support local firms and local jobs.

  * Statements of intent covering renewable energy; the central and local shares of retained business rates; and the safety net and levy

  * A technical paper setting out proposals on pooling arrangements for local authorities

  * An analytical paper - _The economic benefits of local business rate retention_.

**Localising support for council tax** - to strengthen the incentive for councils to help their residents get back into employment.

  * Statements of intent covering forthcoming regulations and requirements for preparing a scheme; transitional arrangements; prescribed requirements for schemes; council tax base adjustments and risk sharing of financial pressures
  * A consultation on the funding of localised support for council tax.

Further documents as well as key draft regulations will be published before the summer recess.

The full set of documents have been published today following a Written Ministerial statement and are available here under 'Related publications': [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/lgfinancebill/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/lgfinancebill/).

2. Last year the £19 billion in business rates collected by councils was recovered by Government and redistributed through a complex process known as 'Formula Grant'. The renowned Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has called this one of the most centralised systems in the world. USA, Spain, France, Germany and Japan all have greater autonomy over local budgets than English councils.

3. The reforms within the Bill are part of the wider Government approach to give local people and local communities far greater control over the decisions that affect them. For example the Growing Places Fund, the New Homes Bonus and Community Infrastructure Levy.

4. There will be no difference in the way businesses pay tax or the way the tax is set. Rate setting powers will remain under Central Government control and the revaluation process will stay unchanged. Importantly there will be no changes to the rate bills that local charities, amateur sports clubs, voluntary groups, those in hardship, rural firms and small businesses pay. Those businesses and voluntary groups will continue to get the national discounts and reliefs they have always been offered.

5. The Bill would support the sucess of the 24 confirmed enterprise zones across the country by enabling the uplift in business rates on those sites to be retained locally and invested back into growth projects across the local enterprise partnership area. This Bill would also allow councils to pay for future infrastructure developments by allowing them to borrow against projected business rate growth. Councils are not currently permitted to retain their rates so cannot borrow against them. Rates retention would remove this barrier.

6. The economic benefits analysis, available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/businessrateseconomic](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/businessrateseconomic), models the potential additional GDP from the proposed rates retention scheme, with varying labour productivity and floorspace growth scenarios, and estimates that under seven year reset period, 50 per cent local share and central incentive assumptions would be an additional £10 billion could be created. This is based on scenarios modelled over a range from around £2 billion to just under £20 billion. The analysis was externally reviewed by Professor Henry Overman, Director of the Spatial Economics Research Centre, who endorsed the approach.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2105162,Eric Pickles sees the future of the Olympic village,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has seen the vision of the future Olympic Park which will provide thousands of much-needed new homes for residents in the capital after the 2012 Games.

Mr Pickles opened the _East Village - a lasting legacy for London_ exhibition and saw for himself the housing designs for the East Village, the legacy for the Olympic Athletes Village site.

The exhibition, hosted at New London Architecture, showcased the designs created by Qatari Diar Delancey (joint partnership between Delancey and Qatari Diar Real Estate Development Company) and Triathlon Homes (a joint partnership between East Thames Group, First Base and Southern housing Group) who are the collaborative team behind the project.

With the Olympics set to be delivered on time and on budget, the next, important challenge is to produce a lasting, living legacy for East London and the provision of 2,818 new homes is a significant milestone to ensuring this is achieved.

With half being allocated for social housing, the development offers affordable homes with choice of buying or renting to people with a range of income levels and allows the local community to take ownership of the Olympic legacy.

Mr Pickles also explained to the audience that he had taken further steps to allow the Mayor of London to create the London Legacy Development Corporation which will take forward regeneration in the Olympic Park and in the surrounding areas of East London.

The Corporation has further plans for the Olympic Park including the building of further new homes and associated job creation.

Speaking at the event, Mr Pickles said:

> ""The Olympic Park represents the most significant regeneration project of the next 25 years. The Government is ensuring there is a lasting legacy from the Games and the innovative and attractive architectural designs on display here highlight the commitment to that ideal.
> 
> ""This is the first step for creating a vibrant East Village and I look forward to seeing the successful designs on display here turn into real homes and create places where people want to live.""

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, added:

> ""A key aim in delivering thousands of new homes in the Olympic Park after the Games is to ensure that local people benefit from the 2012 legacy. The East Village proposals give east Londoners from different backgrounds the real opportunity to be part of the new communities we are creating. I will ensure that such choice is at the heart of all planning as City Hall takes forward the rebirth of this important part of the capital.""

All spending on goods and services over £500 has been put online. The information for 2009-10 details £314m of spending by the Department and £337m by Departmental quangos.

In a move that signals a new era in central government transparency taxpayers can how see how their money is being spent, what was purchased, for how much and from whom.

### Leading the charge for transparency

Communities and Local Government is leading the charge in establishing a new kind of government where the public have a right to know and a right to challenge. The publication of £500 spending data comes ahead of all councils doing so later this year.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Greater openness in spending is the best way to root out waste, spot duplication and increase value for money. That is why I have been asking councils to 'show me the money' so local taxpayers can see where their hard earned cash is going.
> 
> ""Now it's our turn. I don't believe in one rule for councils and one for this Department. Central Government spends billions of tax pounds every year and transparency at this level of spending is just as important.
> 
> ""This Department, like the rest of Whitehall, needs to look at where every penny is going and getting this data out in the open will help that process.
> 
> ""The simple task of putting spending online will open the doors to an army of armchair auditors who will be able to see at a glance exactly where millions of pounds spent last year went. The public and the press can go through the books and hold Ministers to account for how taxpayers' money is being spent.
> 
> ""The data is already highlighting how we need to do things differently. That means spending more carefully, getting better deals and asking ourselves at every turn whether every purchase is needed and whether it provides value for the taxpayers' pound. Looking at last year's spending it is clear that there is room for improvement.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1893278,Eric Pickles tells councils to come and join the party,"As people and communities up and down the country start unravelling the bunting for their Royal Wedding street parties, the Government is reminding councils not to be over-zealous and ensure they don't spoil the fun with red tape and bureaucracy.

Many myths have arisen about what people are entitled to do, and whether they need permission for a street party during the Royal Wedding celebrations. This is why Communities Secretary Eric Pickles wrote to all councils recently urging them to cut red tape and bust common street party myths. The Government has also simplified national guidelines so that they are as clear as possible.

Some councils had previously misinterpreted guidance, applying excessive bureaucracy and cost to residents, for example by charging fees for road closures and hiring expensive traffic management companies or equipment.

Many councils have now chosen to slash red tape instead and support street parties by:

  * waiving road closure charges - indeed there is no requirement at all for closures on small roads and councils can provide advice on traffic management
  * not automatically insisting on public liability insurance - Prime Minister David Cameron recently announced it is no longer a requirement for small street parties to hold insurance. Councils can advise further on individual circumstances

With support and advice from Streets Alive many councils and communities have been able to bust these myths and take a common sense approach.

One council, Hertfordshire County Council has received an incredible 298 road closure applications making it the royal wedding street party capital. Part of the county's success has been to cut red tape and provide a user friendly online application form, as well as its decision to waive road closure fees.

Other things councils can do to help include consulting residents and working with community organisation like Streets Alive, and giving residents bite-sized information about what they can do and where they may need to take advice from their local authority.

Nikki Jamieson, a Hertfordshire resident who is organising a street party for her neighbours, said:

> ""We've had a few street parties before and it's been a great way to get to know neighbours and make our local community stronger. We've made new friends and we've even been able to help some vulnerable people in our street as a result. When the bad weather hit last winter a few of us popped in to check older, housebound residents were ok. If we hadn't got to know them at previous street parties, we never would have known that they might need our help.
> 
> ""Hertfordshire County Council has made it really easy to apply for a street party and the fact that the normal fee has been waived has been an added bonus. Thanks to them, all my neighbours and I are really looking forward to a great party on April 29.""

With many people taking part in street parties on 29 April, the up coming Big Lunch street party is likely to have even more revellers on 5 June.

Mr Pickles and Ms Casey toured the Edge of Care Family Intervention Project in Torbay and the Green Ark Children's Centre in Plymouth meeting both key workers and families. The two centres were praised as excellent examples of early-intervention work aiming to tackle troubled families.![Eric Pickles and Louise Casey visit a community centre in Devon](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2071067)

Mr Pickles and Ms Casey heard from Plymouth and Torbay councils directly about the best methods for how central and local government can work together in tackling troubled families together in the future.

The visit is part of a determined drive by the Government to turn around the lives of 120,000 of the country's troubled families. Last month the Prime Minister and Mr Pickles launched the strategy and announced nearly half a billion pounds of funding to help local authorities achieve success.

Troubled families cost society nearly £9 billion every year with most of that spent just to contain and respond to problems such as crime and anti-social behaviour, or placing children into care.

The excellent work being done in Plymouth and Torbay will help inform the work of the Troubled Families Team as they draw up plans to work with other councils across the country.

Whilst on the visit, Mr Pickles and Ms Casey also heard from the families involved and discussed what other measures would be useful in helping them turn their lives around.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Government is committed to transforming the lives of these troubled families and I've seen today the good work local authorities are already doing. We want to achieve real results and the work of the Troubled Families Team will build on the success of what is taking place in Torbay and Plymouth.""

Louise Casey said:

> ""Troubled families are families that both have problems and can cause problems. Last year around £75,000 per family was spent largely on dealing with the problems these families can create. But now across the country we have to take action that gets to the causes and really helps get families back on track. It's a huge challenge and I'm delighted with the response I've received so far from people willing to work together to make real and lasting change.""

### Notes to editors

1) In December 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced £450 million plans to radically transform the lives of the country's most troubled families. A new Troubled Families Team based within the Department for Communities and Local Government and headed by Louise Casey, has been established to join up efforts across Whitehall, provide expert help to local areas and drive forward the strategy.

2) £448 million will be made available to the Troubled Families Team to turn around the lives of 120,000 families over the next three years. Most of this money will follow a payment by results model, which equates to up to 40 per cent of the money needed to turn round families. The remaining 60 per cent will be found from across the budgets of a range of local bodies.

3) The government will also fund a national network of Troubled Family 'Trouble-shooters' in each (upper-tier) local council. The trouble-shooters will operate at a senior level to oversee the programme of action in their area - getting a grip on the numbers, bringing together police, job centre plus, health organisations, schools) to put a robust plan of action in place to deal with the families and ensuring the right action is being taken with each family and levering in resources for their local programme.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1688111,Eric Pickles to disband Audit Commission in new era of town hall transparency,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced plans to disband the Audit Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions. The changes will pass power down to people, replace bureaucratic accountability with democratic accountability and save the taxpayer £50 million a year.

The new Government will set in train measures to radically scale back centrally imposed, bureaucratic and costly inspection and auditing, saving council taxpayers money. The audit expertise of the Commission will be moved into the private sector.

The Audit Commission's responsibilities for overseeing and delivering local audit and inspections will stop; the Commission's research activities will end; audit functions will be moved to the private sector; councils will be free to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market; and there will be a new audit framework for local health bodies. This will save council taxpayers' money and decentralise power.

Ministers believe that the work of the Commission has increasingly become less focused on accountability to citizens and more on reporting upwards to Government, judging services largely against top down Government imposed targets.

As a result of the changes, the Audit Commission's in-house audit practice, which is the fifth largest audit practice in the country, will be transferred out of public ownership. A range of options will be developed for converting the audit practice into a business independent of Government which could be sold or otherwise transferred into the private sector.

A new decentralised audit regime will be established, replacing the Audit Commission and providing genuine support for local democratic accountability. This new decentralised approach, applicable to local government, police, and local health bodies, will:

  * **Shift power from Westminster to people**: Local people, not Whitehall, will now be the audience for the assurances audit gives on local spending decisions. The Government is committed to promoting decentralisation and democratic engagement and ending the era of top-down government by giving new powers to local councils, communities, neighbourhoods and individuals. This needs to be underpinned by audit reporting not upwards to Whitehall departments but to local people.
  * **Citizens' rights**: The powers of the separate Local Government Ombudsman will be strengthened, to give residents greater rights when local services go wrong.
  * **Save the taxpayer over £50 million a year**: This will include saving the central and corporate costs of the Audit Commission, currently paid for by the Commission's fees including a surcharge on audits, including those by private firms. In addition, councils will be able to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market among audit firms, reducing costs.
  * **Maintain auditing standards**: Councils and local health bodies will still be subject to robust auditing. Protections will be developed to ensure independence, competence and quality, including audit quality regulated within a statutory framework, overseen by the National Audit Office and profession. The Commission's research activities would stop; ending duplication with others and strengthening the National Audit Office's role in this area.
  * **Protecting children and the vulnerable**: Inspection and intervention will remain for the most vulnerable to protect public welfare, including children's services and adult social care.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""The corporate centre of the Audit Commission has lost its way. Rather than being a watchdog that champions taxpayers' interests, it has become the creature of the Whitehall state.
> 
> ""We need to redress this balance. Audit should remain to ensure taxpayers' money is properly spent, but this can be done in a competitive environment, drawing on professional audit expertise across the country. I want to see the Commission's auditing function become independent of Government, competing for future audit business from the public and private sector.
> 
> ""These proposed changes go hand in hand with plans to create an army of armchair auditors - local people able to hold local bodies to account for the way their tax pounds are spent and what that money is delivering.""

### Notes to editors

1. For local government these changes are part of the Government's wider focus on transparency that will bring about a revolution in town hall openness and accountability. Local people will now be the audience for assurances that their council is spending money wisely, that they are well governed, their council is financially robust, achieving value for money and providing accurate information and data.

2. This will complement plans to strengthen individual citizens' rights of redress should they receive poor council services by enhancing the role of the Local Government Ombudsman through making his findings legally enforceable.

3. District auditors will retain a duty for reporting issues in the public interest. They will be able to undertake special investigations where they, the local government sector or any continuing inspectorates such as Ofsted in the case of children's services, or Care Quality Commission on adult social care, raise concerns about a council. Following any such investigations auditors will report locally and be able to make recommendations to the council, the sector, inspectorates, and if necessary to Government.

4. For the NHS, plans are being developed to establish a new audit framework for local health bodies. Audit changes in health will be consistent with vision set out in Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS designed to provide assurances that support the democratic accountability now proposed, and the accountability and responsibilities of the new NHS Commissioning Board and Monitor as economic regulator. The new framework will not compromise the Department for Health requirement to report to Parliament. The expectation is that greater use will be made of competitive open market auditor appointments, with appropriate protections to ensure quality and independence.

5. For the police these changes will ensure there continues to be robust arrangements for audit, the detail of which is being developed as proposals for directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners are taken forward. These audit arrangements will complement the responsibilities of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, which will continue to oversee the police.

6. Communities and Local Government will now be working closely with the Audit Commission, the accountancy profession, and the local government and health sectors to develop the detailed design of the new systems. We intend to seek the necessary legislation in this Parliamentary session.

7. The aim is for such a system to be in place from the 2012/13 financial year, with the necessary legislation being sought in this Parliamentary session.

8. The NAO is independent of government and the auditor of central government bodies. The NAO is therefore well placed to provide the oversight role for the audit of local government and health and would need to be able to rely on the work of local auditors when forming its audit opinion on the adequacy of assurance provided by departments. Combined with its existing functions, the oversight role would enable the NAO to report to Parliament on the quality of audit across the local government and health sectors, and on the economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity of these sectors.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1625230,Eric Pickles to stop 'propaganda on the rates' killing off local newspapers,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today announced a toughening up of rules governing taxpayer-funded council newspapers. The goal is to ensure a robust and healthy independent local press can continue to scrutinise the activities of local councils.

In recent years there has been a major growth in the number, frequency and scope of council newspapers. At the same time, local communities are seeing a decline in the number of local newspapers.

Council publicity can be an effective way for councils to communicate with their residents on council business and activity. However, there are concerns that too many of these papers are branching into non-council content such as TV listings and sports reviews; that the councils dress up their literature as 'independent' publications; and the frequency of the free, delivered newspapers undermines commercial local newspapers.

Independent local papers are a vital part of any thriving democracy. The rigour with which local journalists scrutinise the activity and spending of councils is a key factor in open and transparent government where local people can hold their councillors to account.

The steady creep of publicity beyond council-related matters started in 2001 when a watering down of a statutory code lifted the restrictions on council publicity. The new Secretary of State intends to clamp down on this by making changes to the statutory code that will stop unfair competition, ensure a tougher value for money test, and prevent municipal literature passing itself off as independent journalism.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles said:

> ""The previous Government's weakening of the rules on town hall publicity not only wasted taxpayers' money and added to the wave of junk mail, but has undermined a free press.
> 
> ""Councils should spend less time and money on weekly town hall Pravdas that end up in the bin, and focus more on frontline services like providing regular rubbish collections.
> 
> ""In an internet age, commercial newspapers should expect over time less state advertising as more information is syndicated online for free. The flipside is our free press should not face state competition from propaganda on the rates dressed up as local reporting.""

### Notes to editors

1. Subject to consultation the new Government is minded to revise and tighten the _Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity_. The Code was originally introduced in 1988 and amended by the last Government in 2001. It is statutory guidance to local authorities. The Secretary of State is legally obliged to consult on the revised code.

2. The Newspaper Society has warned: ""The Code(s) implicit encouragement of the expansion of local government media and local government produced 'news' at the expense of an independent local press is unacceptable and requires revision. The regional media industry is very concerned by the ever increasing threat posed by local authorities' publications, websites and broadcast services, which purport to offer 'independent' local news and compete with local media for readers and advertising revenues. They do not focus upon the local authorities' core activities. Their objectivity must be highly questionable. Yet it is very difficult to mount any legal challenge"" (Newspaper Society, _Response to the DCLG consultation on the Code of recommended practice on local authority publicity_, March 2009, para 7.4).

3. A survey by the Taxpayers' Alliance has found that town hall publicity now costs £430 million a year - double the rate of 1997 (TPA, _Council spending uncovered: Publicity_, December 2008). Yet some councils have identified significant savings from cutting back spending on town hall newspapers. The Lancashire County Council has saved nearly £300,000 a year from scaling back its _Vision_ newspaper (_Lancashire Telegraph_, 3 August 2009). The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has saved £2.9 million a year from the City Hall publicity budget by abolishing _The Londoner_ newspaper, and is using some of the savings to help plant trees instead (GLA press release, 13 May 2008).

4. Tower Hamlets states: ""As well as news releases provided by the Corporate Communications Team, the council's community weekly newspaper _East End Life_ is delivered free to more than 80,000 homes and businesses in the borough and is packed with local news and information as well as entertainment listings"" ([www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgsl/351-400/359_council_news_and_informati.aspx](http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgsl/351-400/359_council_news_and_informati.aspx)).

_Greenwich Time_ is produced 48 times a year ([www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/News/PublicationDates.htm](http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/News/PublicationDates.htm)). Example copies can be found at: [www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/News/GreenwichTime.htm](http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/News/GreenwichTime.htm).

5. The Audit Commission has published a limited survey of the frequency of local authority newspapers by council: [www.audit-commission.gov.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/Downloads/20100201publicityappendixsupplement.pdf](http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/Downloads/20100201publicityappendixsupplement.pdf) (PDF, 63kb, 4 pages).

6. Research conducted by MORI for the Local Government Association found that the majority of residents (55 per cent) value a local 'A-Z of services' as the most useful form of council publicity. This is followed by the council website (40 per cent) and council tax leaflets (38 per cent). Newspapers are valued by just one in three residents (36 per cent) (MORI, _Business Case for the Reputation Project: Research study conducted for the LGA_, January 2006, p.21).

7. The new Government has already set out ambitious plans to help our local media sector. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt has announced he will be relaxing local cross media ownership rules and has started work how Government can help foster the emergence of local television stations. Together with these plans to crack down on unfair local authority newspapers, the Government is doing all it can to foster the sustainable and independent media that is so vital to our democracy ([www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7135.aspx](http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7135.aspx)).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1633604,Eric Pickles unveils radical plan for town halls to help cut red tape,"A radical plan to banish nonsense red tape and repeal unnecessary laws was unveiled by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

In a speech to a local government audience Mr Pickles invited council workers and sector experts to suggest CLG sponsored statutory guidance, secondary legislation or regulations they think should be removed so councils can get on with their job.

Piles of regulatory red tape are a traditional part of law making. But the Government has made it clear that it would shun the bureaucratic levers of the past imposed on councils and help encourage, local people to take control themselves. All 'Cut Red Tape' ideas that are put forward will be considered.

Ministers are already earmarking pages of unnecessary regulations, ridiculous micromanagement or outdated laws that need to be re-examined. For example the 1919 law that required the Secretary of State's consent if councils wanted to buy new land for allotments; three different sets of regulation governing tree protection; and guidance on the duty to carry out an economic assessment.

The coalition programme for government committed to giving the public the opportunity to challenge the worst regulations and to introducing a 'one-in, one-out' rule whereby no new regulation is brought in without other regulation being cut by a greater amount. And 'sunset clauses' will ensure regulation is regularly reviewed.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Too much power has been sucked out of communities into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy.
> 
> ""More often than not over legislating simply lead to bureaucrats ticking extra sets of boxes on forms but none of the real changes that are needed. We need a sensible new approach that makes clear laws are intended to protect people, not overwhelm them with red tape.
> 
> ""Today I am asking councils to put localism into action and help us cut back red tape, wrest control away from the bureaucrats, reverse the years of creeping state control and return power to people, communities and councils.
> 
> ""Up and down the country there are thousands of town hall workers and sector experts who want to make a real difference in their communities. But for far too long they have been tied up in needless bureaucracy that has been a burden on the important work they want to do.""

The Deputy Prime Minister is spearheading the coalition's push to restore power to individuals creating a more open politics where the public are more engaged in Government where as many people as possible submit ideas for change.  The Government launched the 'Your Freedom' public debate and website last Thursday.

Councils are already welcoming the chance to reduce burdens with over 240 having coming forward already. All ideas should be sent to: [cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:%20cutredtape@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

### Notes to Editors

1. List of CLG secondary legislation being considered for revocation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/about/helpcutredtape](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/about/helpcutredtape/).

The coalition has already begun to roll back on swathes of unnecessary red tape:

  * called time on the Regional Spatial Strategy putting power back in the hands of local people and scrapped housing targets. Soon I will be announcing the full list of incentives to local authorities that will encourage development

  * made HIPS history and already the number of homes being put up for sale has gone up by 35 per cent

  * put an end to unwanted 'garden grabbing' putting the decision back in the hands of local people

  * cut the ring fencing and red tape which comes attached to hundreds of millions pounds worth of central government grants

  * abolished Comprehensive Area Assessments where town halls report back to Whitehall

  * handed over more power to councils so they can manage high concentrations of shared housing in their area, without putting off landlords from renting the homes people need

  * Vince Cable has announced an immediate review of all regulation in the pipeline for implementation which has been inherited from the last Government

  * Lord Young of Graffham has been appointed as advisor to the prime minister on health and safety law and practice to reduce the compensation culture.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1912920,Eric Pickles urges bank holiday vigilance against planning cheats,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles is today reminding councils to be alert over the bank holiday weekend so no one can break planning laws and expect to get away with it.

Mr Pickles said that councils should be ready to use their powers and act against unauthorised development over the extended weekend, ensuring the system for retrospective planning applications is not abused. He also pledged to strengthen the existing powers that councils have to halt developments that are breaching planning laws.

Current powers available to councils include Temporary Stop Notices, which can mean that activities that breach planning control must stop immediately, with offenders facing a fine of up to £20,000 if they fail to comply. The Government is currently considering options to strengthen the hand of councils to use these powers to tackle unauthorised developments.

This follows a number of cases where people have put in a planning application over a bank holiday weekend, and used that time to develop land illegally whilst council offices are closed and officers unavailable to take action to stop it. The delay means that by the time the application is assessed and enforcement action taken, development can already have occurred - for example laying concrete driveways or cutting down protected trees.

Mr Pickles urged councils to have planning officers on call, ready to deal with last minute applications and take rapid enforcement action against any unauthorised development.

Vigilance against abuse of the planning system will help reduce the volume of retrospective planning applications, which are expensive for the taxpayer, put an unnecessary strain on the planning system and are not fair to the vast majority of people who play by the rules.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""For years, dodgy developments have been thrown up on bank holiday weekends when planning departments are closed, leaving them with a major headache when they come back to work.
> 
> ""It's wrong that a small minority of planning cheats can play the system in this way, leaving councils with months, and sometimes years, of hassle to get rid of developments that shouldn't be there. Unauthorised developments have also created tensions between travellers and the settled population. We want to redress the balance and put fairness back into communities.
> 
> ""That's why I'm calling on councils to take precautionary measures and make sure that they have planning officers ready to deal with any planning applications submitted over the weekend. But we also want to help councils ensure there is fair play in the planning system, so we are looking at strengthening Temporary Stop Notices to toughen up councils' existing powers to tackle unauthorised development.""

Additional measures are being introduced through the Localism Bill to limit opportunities for retrospective planning permission in relation to any form of unauthorised development, and to increase the powers that local authorities have to enforce against breaches of planning control. In the meantime Ministers are urging councils to remain vigilant against breaches of planning rules, and use the existing powers at their disposal.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1890867,Eric Pickles urges England to fly the flag for St George's Day,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today called on the people of England to fly their nation's flag with pride to mark St George's Day this coming Saturday (23 April 2011).

Mr Pickles urged public bodies not to be spoilsports when it comes to allowing the public to display the famous red on white cross. He encouraged them to adopt a common sense approach to flying the flag - rather than misapplying or misinterpreting the rules.

Given extremist groups have previously tried to lay claim to the Cross of St George, Mr Pickles is urging everyone to play their part in helping to reclaim the English flag as a proud and potent symbol of the nation's identity. He believes flying the flag strengthens community cohesion and should be actively encouraged by all public bodies.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Whatever one's class, colour or creed, the St George's flag is a unifying symbol for our nation. Let's fly the English flag with pride this weekend, to be followed by the Union flag come the Royal Wedding.""

### Notes to editors

1. Mr Pickles has been encouraging the flying of England's historic county flags over the past year, to champion England's diverse local identities.

2. Last summer ahead of the World Cup, the Local Government Minister Grant Shapps wrote to Local Authorities encouraging them to take a common sense approach to allowing communities to display the England flag during the tournament. There have been incidents in the past where local councils have asked for flags to be taken down due to interpretation of health and safety or advertising guidelines.

![Eric Pickles celebrates 6 months on from the riots](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2090760)Joined by Haringey Council leader Claire Kober and local MP David Lammy, Mr. Pickles also toured the high street to see how the community is using the support available and their 'I love Tottenham' campaign to help get businesses back on their feet.

The blaze at the town's Carpet Right store became a key image of the summer disturbances and the Secretary of State was shown the progress underway to repair the building.

To mark six months on Mr. Pickles also popped into the local post office, relocated to a new building in the aftermath of the riots, to see how it has remained a focal point of community life and where residents can get on with their day-to-day business.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The most powerful enduring image of the disturbances is not of the minority of rioters but the majority of local people and local businesses that all came together in Tottenham with Haringey Council to rebuild their communities.
> 
> ""The people of Tottenham can take pride in how they have gone about restoring their community. Because of this energetic approach Tottenham's community is already starting to turn the corner and look ahead to future growth and prosperity.""

In the immediate aftermath of the riots the Government made available a mulit-million pound package of support to enable councils to act swiftly and confidently to restore communities and get support to local people and businesses.

In August 2011 the Communities Secretary announced, a £20 million enterprise and growth package for Tottenham and Croydon to kick start economic regeneration, support business, deliver new job opportunities and promote their future prosperity.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1999007,£250 million for councils to support weekly bin collections,"A new fund of up to £250million will support councils to deliver a weekly collection of household waste and improve the environment, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today (30 September 2011).

The new Weekly Collections Support Scheme will both support weekly collections and enable councils to invest in schemes and projects that will benefit the environment including through raising recycling rates. In the coming months councils will be invited to submit innovative bids for funding.

Ministers believe more frequent collections are likely to discourage fly-tipping and littering as well as reducing problems with vermin and pests.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Weekly rubbish collections are the most visible of all front-line services and I believe every household in England has a basic right to have their rubbish collected every week.
> 
> ""Our fund will help councils deliver weekly collections and in the process make it easier for families to go green and improve the local environment.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, added:

> ""Hard-pressed families across the country pay their council taxes and local authorities should be looking to deliver the kinds of frontline services that they want. This new fund will help councils whose residents want their rubbish collected more frequently to reinstate weekly bin rounds for smelly waste, while also seeking new and innovative ways to increase recycling and look after the environment.""

Councils will be able to bid individually or in consortiums, and with the private sector, where that increases value for money. In order to encourage the most innovative and locally tailored solutions, authorities will be able to bid for a mix of revenue and capital funding. Further detail of how the Support Scheme will operate and how councils can bid will be set out in due course.

### Notes to Editors

1. The Waste Review published this summer stated that 'The Government will be working with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, and to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections. The Government understands that the public have a reasonable expectation that household waste collections services should be weekly, particularly for smelly waste' (Government Review of Waste Policy in England, p.7).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1870382,100% Council Tax freeze protection delivered across the country,"Local people will get a much needed tax break with every English council taking up a Government offer to fund the first ever council tax freeze, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles confirmed today.

With council tax more than doubling since 1997, Ministers were determined to protect hard-working families and pensioners on fixed incomes this year and set aside a £650 million funding pot to support councils willing to freeze or reduce their council tax.

Official statistics published today on council tax levels show the average Band D council tax set by Local Authorities in England will remain unchanged at £1,439 for 2011-12 as a result of a zero per cent increase on last year's council tax level.

This is the first time ever that 100 per cent of local authorities have reduced or frozen council tax since its introduction in 1993-94. 378 authorities have been able to freeze their council tax whilst 43 have opted to reduce it.

Despite immense pressures on the public purse the Coalition Government is committed to helping people struggling with their day-to-day bills keep the cost of living down as a result of the 100 per cent response to the Government's freeze initiative.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""This Government has made sure that for the first time ever council tax bills have remained frozen all over the country this year - saving some local tax payers up to £72. We are standing up for the hard-pressed taxpayer who watched their council tax bill double.
> 
> ""Tackling public debt is our highest priority but we are determined to protect hard working families and pensioners who have been squeezed for too long. This is about giving real and immediate help to families struggling with the daily cost of living.
> 
> ""As well as special funding that has ensured councils freeze their bills, the Government has scrapped a council tax revaluation and in the future residents themselves will have the right to veto excessive increases in local referendums.""

Every eligible English local authority will now receive grant equivalent to them having increased their council tax by 2.5 per cent. This will be paid in ten equal instalments from April 2011. No further capping action is required in 2011-12.

The capping threshold in recent years was a 5 per cent council tax rise. Stopping such a rise this year saves a typical household up to £72 and if an average 2.5 per cent rise had occurred the saving would have been £36.

Every part of the public sector is playing its part as the country starts to pay back unprecedented levels public debt - including local government which accounts for a quarter of all public expenditure.

But Ministers have prioritised protecting the vulnerable and made the council tax freeze money available to protect hard pressed families and pensioners from rising tax bills at this critical time. In addition the Government has confirmed a fair and progressive funding settlement with new funding freedoms that will shield the most vulnerable and protect frontline services like rubbish collections and care for the elderly.

Moving forward, the Localism Bill makes provision to replace government capping powers with new, binding council tax referendums from 2012-13 where an authority is proposing an excessive increase. The Government has also protected families from potential increases in council tax bills by ruling out a council tax revaluation in England for the remainder of this Parliament. The Bill would also abolish bin taxes - which would have led to new charges for household waste collections for many families on top of council tax.

### Notes to editors

1. Council tax level statistics published today can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/counciltax201112](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/counciltax201112).

2. Although the council tax freeze is only for one year, financial provision is made to support the freeze across the Spending Review. This will avoid 'cliff-edge' effects of council tax soaring in future years, and will 'lock in' the benefits of this year's freeze over each year over the Spending Review.

3. In the future the public will be given the power to veto excessive council tax rises. Councils that set council tax increase above a set ceiling, approved by Parliament each year, would trigger an automatic referendum of all registered electors in their area: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293).

4. The Government also confirmed in September that there would be no council tax revaluation in England during the lifetime of this Parliament: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1723670](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1723670).

5. The eligible authorities for the council tax freeze are local, police, and fire and rescue authorities - all these authorities have frozen or reduced their council tax. Parish councils are not covered, so bills in some areas may show small increases in cash terms due to parish precept increases.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1685201,Blazing a trail on spending transparency,"The Secretary of State opens the books to an army of armchair auditors as all Departmental spending over £500 goes online.

Eric Pickles turns the spotlight on spending firmly on his own department today as details of how £314 million of taxpayer money was spent by the Department for Communities and Local Government last year are published for the first time.

The decision by the Secretary of State to make spending data more freely available makes the Communities Department a trailblazer for transparency within Whitehall and ahead of local government.

Every item of Departmental spending on goods and services over £500 in 2009/10 has been put online, allowing the public to see what was purchased, for how much and from whom.

Previously unseen Department data shows 1900 separate items of expenditure totalling £314 million. This includes £635,000 on taxis and cars and nearly £310,000 on catering and food.

The figures also show that the Department last year spent £16m on marketing, advertising, promotion and events.

The Secretary of State has asked the main Departmental Arms Length Bodies to open their books too. Information on these seventeen organisations gives detail of another £337million of spending.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Greater openness in spending is the best way to root out waste, spot duplication and increase value for money. That is why I have been asking councils to 'show me the money' so local taxpayers can see where their hard earned cash is going.
> 
> ""Now it's our turn. I don't believe in one rule for councils and one for this Department. Central Government spends billions of tax pounds every year and transparency at this level of spending is just as important.
> 
> ""This Department, like the rest of Whitehall, needs to look at where every penny is going and getting this data out in the open will help that process.
> 
> ""The simple task of putting spending online will open the doors to an army of armchair auditors who will be able to see at a glance exactly where millions of pounds spent last year went. The public and the press can go through the books and hold Ministers to account for how taxpayers' money is being spent.
> 
> ""The data is already highlighting how we need to do things differently. That means spending more carefully, getting better deals and asking ourselves at every turn whether every purchase is needed and whether it provides value for the taxpayers' pound. Looking at last year's spending it is clear that there is room for improvement.""

Today's publication follows on from new requirements on local authorities to improve transparency and publish their spending information. Eric Pickles has called for all town hall spending on goods and services above £500 to be out online by January. Twenty eight Local Authorities have already done this and more detail can be found at [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/transparency/localgovernmentexpenditure/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1685201).

As part of the new Government's commitment to transparency, accountability and openness, all central government departments are required to publish spending over £25,000 online from November 2010. The Secretary of State thinks that having set the bar at £500 for town halls, his own Department should play by the same rules. Communities and Local Government is the first government department to make such a move.

In September (ahead of deadline) CLG will publish spend data for the first quarter of 2010.  From the November deadline, Communities and Local Government and its Arms Length Bodies will put details of all spending over £500 online as a matter of routine at the end of each month.

Greater openness of government data is part of wider plans to identify waste, reduce public spending and protect frontline services. The Department for Communities and Local Government is announcing today that £32m in year savings will be made following a review of spending decisions and pilot programmes.

In May, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury wrote to Secretaries of State asking them to re-examine all pilot schemes within their respective departments to evaluate whether they represented value for money and would deliver robust findings with a view to stopping those which did not. Consequently Communities and Local Government is today announcing that 5 pilot schemes will be discontinued saving £3m.

A further £29m savings have been identified following a review of all spending decisions since January 1st this year. Ministers have sought to cancel or suspend projects which are not affordable, do not represent good value for money, or which did not reflect the Government's priorities.

The £32m savings announced today are in addition to £6.2bn savings announced by the Chief Secretary in June.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2140531,Celebrating the Jubilee in all communities,"Eric Pickles today announced extra funding to ensure that communities are not left out of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations this summer.

With one month to go until the nationwide Big Jubilee Lunch on the next bank holiday weekend in June, the Communities Secretary said he would spend £185,000 on helping more areas to organise their own street parties and events.

The funding means that an additional 20 communities will get the support they need to plan and arrange their own Big Jubilee Lunch celebrations.

The money will be used by the Big Jubilee Lunch organisers, the Eden Project, to identify and support selected areas where there has been little or no participation to date, boosting communities' confidence to host their own event. The money will be spent over two years.

Organisers from the Big Jubilee Lunch will work with community volunteers and leaders to encourage local residents to participate in the event locally, and foster better community relations. Specially produced ""tool-kits"" will be on offer to help local residents run Big Lunches and other community events in the future with confidence.

The communities receiving the money were chosen by the Big Jubilee Lunch and the Eden Project using a range of criteria which looked at the frequency of previous community events, socio-economic factors and geographic spread. Each community will be free to decide how to use its funding in the manner that best matches its needs.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""2012 is a year of celebration: both the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic Games will bring the country to its feet. The Big Jubilee Lunch is a unique opportunity to encourage people from different backgrounds across the UK to get together to build common ground.
> 
> ""I'm delighted that the Eden Project is helping the Government ensure that these communities aren't left out when it comes to the biggest celebration of the year.
> 
> ""By supporting them to take the lead and organise their own Big Jubilee Lunch, we're paving the way for ongoing community action.
> 
> ""People in these areas will realise that together they have the know-how and power to take charge of what happens in their local area.""

The Eden Project's Director of Campaigns, Peter Stewart, said:

> ""This is a really exciting opportunity to support communities across England and help them to create their own, unique Big Jubilee Lunch.
> 
> ""These communities stretch from St Blazey in the south to Gateshead in the north. St Blazey residents have already started planning their event across two outdoor venues, incorporating a wide range of fun activities from a children's disco to a 1950s style sports day.""

### Notes to editors

1. The £185,000 funding over two years will enable the Eden Project to provide targeted support to 20 communities each year.

2. Work is well under way in the 10 areas below in the run up to the Big Jubilee Lunch. The remaining 10 areas will be announced shortly:

1. St Blazey and Par (South West)  
2. East Coseley Dudley (West Midlands)  
3. Warsop Parish Mansfield (East Midlands)  
4. Loughborough Junction (Lambeth)  
5. Livesey Peckham (London)  
6. Dewsbury Kirklees (Yorkshire and the Humber)  
7. Northfleet North Gravesham (South East)  
8. Priory Court Waltham Forest (London)  
9. East Cleveland Rural Villages Redcar and Cleveland (North East)  
10. Teams and Derwentwater Gateshead (North East)

3. Research shows that that three quarters of those who have previously taken part in a Big Lunch say they have kept in touch and feel closer to their neighbours; more than half of those who took part in 2011 are planning additional activities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1850364,Citizen journalists and bloggers should be let in to public council meetings,"Councils should open up their public meetings to local news 'bloggers' and routinely allow online filming of public discussions as part of increasing their transparency, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

To ensure all parts of the modern-day media are able to scrutinise Local Government, Mr Pickles believes councils should also open up public meetings to the 'citizen journalist' as well as the mainstream media, especially as important budget decisions are being made.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill has written to all councils urging greater openness and calling on them to adopt a modern day approach so that credible community or 'hyper-local' bloggers and online broadcasters get the same routine access to council meetings as the traditional accredited media have.

The letter sent today reminds councils that local authority meetings are already open to the general public, which raises concerns about why in some cases bloggers and press have been barred.

For example Tameside Council has accredited professional journalists to report from meetings using Twitter. The decision means local bloggers, the public and even councillors are not permitted to tweet because they are not considered members of the press.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Fifty years ago, Margaret Thatcher changed the law to make councils open their meetings to the press and public. This principle of openness needs to be updated for the 21st Century. More and more local news comes from bloggers or citizen journalists telling us what is happening at their local council.
> 
> ""Many councils are internet-savvy and stream meetings online, but some don't seem to have caught up with the times and are refusing to let bloggers or hyper-local news sites in. With local authorities in the process of setting next year's budget this is more important than ever.
> 
> ""Opening the door to new media costs nothing and will help improve public scrutiny. The greater powers and freedoms that we are giving local councils must be accompanied by stronger local accountability.
> 
> ""We are in the digital age and this analogue interpretation of the press access rules is holding back a new wave of local scrutiny, accountability and armchair auditors.""

The letter also reassured councils that giving greater access will not contradict data protection law requirements following concerns over personal information. In the majority of cases the citizen blogging about how they see the democratic process working is unlikely to breach the data protection principles.  
 

Chris Taggart, of [www.OpenlyLocal.com](http://openlylocal.com/) (external link), which has long championed the need to open council business up to public scrutiny, added:

> ""In a world where hi-definition video cameras are under £100 and hyperlocal bloggers are doing some of the best council reporting in the country, it is crazy that councils are prohibiting members of the public from videoing, tweeting and live-blogging their meetings.
> 
> ""Councils need to genuinely engage their communities and giving wider access to their meetings through these technologies is one way they can do this.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2092169,Communities together not apart,"The Government has called on people to come together and play their full part in local communities. A new 'localist' approach to achieving a more integrated society focusing on creating the conditions for everyone to live and work successfully alongside each other was today unveiled by Secretary of State Eric Pickles and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.

The paper demonstrates how the Coalition Government is moving away from a Whitehall-dictated approach and, because communities know their own local areas best, instead encourages collective action which:

  * emphasises and celebrates what we have in common rather than our differences - by supporting projects such as the Big Lunch and the planned Diamond Jubilee celebrations
  * promotes the responsibilities we have to each other and to society - through programmes such as National Citizen Service, Youth United and A Year of Service
  * enables people to realise their potential to get on in life - by increasing opportunities and tackling persistent inequalities in access to training, jobs, education and business finance
  * gives people of all backgrounds the opportunities to play an active part, be heard and take decisions - including new provisions in the Localism Act 2011 to put neighbourhoods in control
  * ensures that intolerance is robustly challenged and extremist views and behaviour marginalised by improving the recording of hate crime including against the Muslim and Jewish communities.

While Government has an important role to play, this new approach is based on a conviction that the challenges facing local communities today are too complex to be tackled simply by blanket solutions - or by singling out specific groups for special treatment. An integrated society is vital to building strong , prosperous sustainable communities.

The paper argues that Britain, with its proud history of migration and tolerance, is well placed to meet the challenges of integration. And with the unprecedented pace of change in our communities over the past decade we must now more than ever robustly protect and promote our core values such as democracy, the rule of law, equality of opportunity and freedom of speech.

Secretary of State Eric Pickles said:

> ""We are rightly proud of our strong history of successful integration and the benefits that it's brought. Britain is a place where the vast majority of people from all walks of life get on well with each other. Events such as the Royal Wedding and the Big Lunch show that community spirit is thriving. I welcome the contribution of everyone but those who advocate separate lives are wrong. It is time to concentrate on the things that unite the British people.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""We have many balanced and successful communities but we know this is not the case everywhere and there are still enduring problems in many neighbourhoods. The Coalition is determined to give everyone the ability and aspiration to prosper, breaking down barriers to social mobility. Every community is different and we need local diversity, not central prescription if we are to grow prosperous and productive communities.""

2. The Department for Communities will lead on integration but the following Departments will also have an important contribution to make: Home Office/UK Border Agency, Department for Education, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Department for Work and Pensions, Office for Civil Society within the Cabinet Office.

3. Departments' mainstream services will make the most impact on integration, rather than any specific new integration activity. For example, the most important actions on social mobility will be those already set out in the Social Mobility Strategy.

Developed by Faith Matters, the project will collate and analyse anti-Muslim incidents in England and provide a mechanism to offer support to victims. This project will contribute to the improvement of our own evidence and understanding of Anti-Muslim Attacks, and build confidence in the Muslim community that action is being taken.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1717213,Councils can generate income without turning motorists into cash cows,"Councils that are offering MOTs rather than wielding the wheel clamp and waging war on motorists are showing how it is possible to earn income and save their residents money, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

**Council MOTs map** [ ![Map showing council run MOT centres](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1716782.jpg)](http://bit.ly/9IOD7G) - [Council run centres](http://bit.ly/9IOD7G) (external link)

Across the country there are hundreds of council run MOT test centres which are used to check council vehicles like buses for their safety and roadworthiness. These centres can also open their doors to the public and because these council run garages only offer tests, not repairs, customers can feel assured that there is no hidden agenda for extra trade.

Visiting a council MOT test centre in Wandsworth South London Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Pushing up parking charges is in many ways the lazy approach to raising revenue. MOT schemes show that there are plenty of opportunities for councils to raise extra income without turning motorists into cash cows.
> 
> ""With a little bit of innovation and creative thinking councils can use the skills and resources already at their disposal to charge and trade in a way that boosts town hall coffers whilst helping rather than hitting the pockets of drivers.
> 
> ""There is nothing inherently wrong with councils making the most of opportunities to generate extra cash offering and charging for services. In many cases this is happening as an add on to their normal business. When the approach is sensible, local people are likely to support trading and charging particularly where doing it helps to protect other services, keeps council tax bills down or when residents themselves can benefit from the services on offer.""

Money Saving Expert, Martin Lewis said:

> ""The feedback we've received from council run MOT centres is fantastic, as people tend to find their vehicle passes with far less fails - though important safety problems are always highlighted.  The fact councils don't offer repairs and therefore have no vested interest in erring on the side of fails has a lot to do with it.""

Council MOTs are just one example of local authorities using their resources to generate income.

### Tree inspections for insurers

Many insurers insist on an annual inspection of trees within policyholder's premises. This is to safeguard owners against trees being blown over or collapsing. A large city council is undertaking these inspections as part of its arboriculture work. The inspections have been carried out for council premises, private householders, private companies and health trusts. This service has been undertaken for approximately one year. The work is undertaken by the council's arboriculture team and equates to around 25 per cent of their workload or £30,000 of income. The external auditor has raised no objections to this work being carried out. Following analysis of the local area it was found that an extreme skills shortage existed in this service and therefore the council decided to utilise the expertise and equipment it possessed to the benefit of the local community. A charge of approximately £100 per tree is made for the inspection process with additional works incurring supplementary fees.

### Highways maintenance - dropped kerbs

Coventry council is providing a service to residents who want to create driveways from the roadway through the verge to the edge of their property. This is offered via powers contained within the Highways Act 1980. The council provides both a quotations and construction service if residents need to drop the kerb from outside their property to make a driveway. The kerbs will be replaced with usually three low units and a splay kerb at each side. Generally the surface will be rebuilt in tarmac for the full width of the footpath. Only where all other crossings in the street are in concrete flag will the flags be reused on a new foundation and the first tarmac layer, followed some days later by the final tarmac layer.

Permission is required from the council in order to construct this. Residents are free to use their own contractors to carry out the work but they must be accredited. Residents will be sent a list of suitable accredited contractors including the council's own direct labour organisation when requesting the work.

These case studies are provided by the Association of Public Service Excellence (see link, top right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1660373,Cutting red tape for summer fetes,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles wants to stem the flow of relentless form filling, high costs and red tape for organising summer street parties and fetes.

Extortionate, inconsistent costs and paperwork for road closures, risk assessments, and temporary event notices are barriers to community events. It can often take weeks and cost thousands of pounds for councils trying to process these applications, which can deter both councils and organisers from putting on events.

There are examples of local communities having to apply for up to five separate licences, pay up to £5,000 for a temporary road closure and obtain insurance cover for £2million for a typical outdoor event.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

""Summer fetes and street parties are a great British tradition that we risk losing to overbearing bureaucracy.

> ""When it comes to putting on street parties, it's like a red tape tombola for organisers depending on which council is processing their application.
> 
> ""Of course we want people to be safe and sound but common sense has to prevail. People are being turned off getting involved due to a merry go round of forms, rules that differ from one council to the next, time and expense. It is time to get a grip, especially if we are to cultivate a sense of community, fix broken Britain and create the Big Society.""

There is often an inconsistent approach by councils who charge different fees and use a number of conflicting regulations, which can present barriers and confusion for small voluntary groups. Organisers can also find it tricky to get upfront advice on public liability insurance, and find out about hidden costs at the last minute.

Mr Pickles is working across government to agree a consistent approach for councils to follow. This will result in good practice guidance being set out for councils and more upfront transparency on what organisers need - whether it's public liability insurance, road closure notices or health and safety assessments.

### Notes to Editors

1. The main barriers to holding street parties and fetes are:

#### Temporary Road Closure under Town Police Causes Act 1847

  * The costs of road closures usually cover traffic management, signage and advertising the closure in local press.
  * Councils differ in their approach; some pass all of the costs on with an additional fee, whilst others don't charge at all.
  * The costs for temporary road closure can range from £25 - £2,100. In many cases the charges are non-negotiable but some authorities group applications together, cover them with a single traffic management order and divide cost amongst participating groups if they received lots of applications for one initiative.
  * Councils require organisers to get written consent from all local residents for their event to go ahead. This can pose problems as it can be time consuming and events are sometimes unable to go ahead because of a small number of people not approving or not responding.
  * Councils can require anywhere between 1 and 12 weeks' notice for road closure applications. Large lead in times can cause problems, especially when they are not published anywhere in the council's communications.
  * Organisers often have to hire signs from an outsourced company and some require a deposit, in addition some may charge a fee.

#### Public Liability Insurance

  * Some councils cover street parties under their own Public Liability Insurance and others require that the organiser takes out insurance to a certain level of cover. The cost of insurance also varies widely, and can be anything from £60-£2,000 for a local outdoor event.
  * As well as the cost of the insurance, requiring people to take out insurance often causes more worry as they believe they are going to get sued by their neighbours (for example if they organise a bouncy castle). Small organisations and local residents are also put off by the form filling involved or struggle to complete the insurance forms.

#### Temporary Event Notice (TEN) under Licensing Act 2003 and Entertainment Licenses

  * The Temporary Events Notice is required if the organiser is supplying alcohol or providing regulated entertainment as defined in the Licensing Act 2003, this requires 10 clear working days to process. Councils charge a fee of £21 for a TEN.
  * If a larger event or festival is being held, the organiser will have to apply and pay for premises licenses a well as license for food, drink and entertainment, as applicable. However, organisers are often unsure whether licenses for food or drink, music and gambling are necessary for their event, if the council does not publish this guidance.
  * If there was a lottery or raffle with tickets sold in advance offering cash prize of up to £1,000, the organisers would have to fill in Lottery Registration Form.  The cost of this form is approx £40; whilst residents parties are exempt from this fee, it is not always clear whether larger parties such as fetes would need a registration form.
  * PRS Music License (or royalties to composers) is needed if recorded music is played; this costs £13 but the fee may be waived if the fete is for a good cause. The lack of signposting on local authority website makes its difficult to know what is required.
  * PPL License is needed for larger events to pay recorded music or royalties to the performers; this costs £41 plus VAT.
  * A license of premises to hold an animal gathering is also needed if a village fete or event in a park wants to have farm animals on show.

#### Risk Assessments and Health and Safety

  * Depending on the size of the event, organisers could be required to carry out a risk assessment for their event. Some authorities provide little or no guidance or templates on what this entails, and where this is available it can be daunting and put people off from organising an event.
  * Whilst the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) produces a risk assessment toolkit for organisers to use on how to identify, manage, evaluate, record and review risks, this can be quite a lengthy document as it is primarily for those 'at work'. The HSE has asked for common sense approaches to risk management and to be more 'proportionate' but organisers sometimes find the messages on risk from various authorities confusing; in addition most insurers will not cover an event unless a detailed risk assessment has been conducted.

2. Many councils are already making it easier for organisers to arrange street parties, such as the Big Lunch which took place in July. This can be done by providing funding from events budget and working with voluntary organisations. 

  * Newcastle City Council has a fund for community focused activity that Big Lunch organisers could apply to - up to £300 per event.
  * London Borough of Croydon roll out all special events applications into a single traffic management order to reduce costs.
  * Birmingham City Council, Norwich County Council charge for specific elements involved in closures, for example organisers have to cover cost of signage or advertising the closure in local press but are not charged for any additional fees.
  * Coventry City Council are providing grants to cover the cost of insurance for road closures.
  * This year the Big Lunch also covered the cost of insurance for road closures.
  * The London Borough of Sutton supported The Big Lunch and charging a reduced rate of £25 in a bid to get as many people to take part as possible.
  * The London Borough of Wandsworth charged a £75 fixed fee which contributed to the costs of drawing up legal notices, publishing adverts and other costs associated with a road closure.

3. Councils not charging for road closures include:

> Birmingham City Council  
Bristol City Council  
Central Bedfordshire Council  
Cornwall Council  
East Devon District Council  
Gateshead Council  
Ipswich City Council  
Norwich City Council  
St. Albans City and District Council             
Trafford Borough Council                      
Southend on Sea Council  
Surrey County Council  
London Borough of Barnet  
London Borough of Bexley                   
London Borough of Croydon  
London Borough of Kingston Upon Thames  
London Borough of Lambeth                                                     
London Borough of Lewisham                               
London Borough of Southwark  
London Borough of Tower Hamlets

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2062875,Essex already winning from the London 2012 Olympic Games,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles was in Essex today to see first-hand how the county is already an Olympic winner from London 2012 Games this summer.

Mr Pickles toured Hadleigh Farm, the site of the Olympic mountain biking track, and Basildon Sporting Village, an official Games training venue that will be home to the Japanese Olympic swim team. He also saw how the 2012 London Games are creating a sporting legacy for Essex that will inspire a generation to become more active.![Eric Pickles at Hadleigh Farm, Olympic mountain bike track](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2063121)

Mr Pickles then saw how the Games are also helping local communities and companies. He will visit Hadleigh's regenerated Old Fire Station to switch the clock back on and present an award to local school children. He also visited John Anthony Signs, a company that won a contract to provide much of the signage around the Olympic Park.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""We are on track for a great Games in 2012. It's going to be an amazing chance to showcase to the world the best of what Britain and Essex has to offer.
> 
> ""The Olympic torch will go through Chelmsford; Hadleigh will host the Mountain Biking competition; and Basildon's training village is set to become a home away from home for many athletes.
> 
> ""Essex already has seen Olympic success through home-grown heroes like Sally Gunnell and Dean Macey. I hope these games will inspire more young people to become Essex Ambassadors or get involved in sport and help leave a lasting legacy for generations to come.""

This morning, Mr Pickles attended a Cabinet meeting at the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, chaired by the Prime Minister David Cameron. The meeting focused on how every part of the UK can take full advantage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the unique chance that that the country has to sell itself to a massive international audience.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

> ""As we kick off 2012, the year of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee, this is the perfect time for the Cabinet to come together and ensure we are doing absolutely everything we can to make the most of this unique opportunity to showcase all the great things the UK has to offer to the rest of the world.
> 
> ""As Ministers visit Olympic venues, businesses, schools and organisations associated with 2012 right across the UK, I want the message to go out loud and clear, from tourism to business, sport to investment, we are determined to maximise the benefits of 2012 for the whole country.
> 
> ""Today, as we mark 200 days to go, and six out of the eight Olympic venues having already secured their future, we are well on track to delivering a lasting legacy for the whole of Britain.""

This afternoon, Cabinet Ministers visited towns and cities across the United Kingdom to see for themselves how businesses, sports facilities, schools and organisations are benefiting from the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

With little over seven months before the opening ceremony, the construction phase is 95 per cent complete and the project continues to be on time and on budget. Since work began on the East London site in 2008, £6.39 billion worth of contracts have been awarded to over 1500 business in the UK, with over £840 million worth going to businesses throughout the East of England.

### Boosting tourism numbers

Hosting the Games this summer will put the United Kingdom in the international spotlight and the Government is committed to ensuring that the tourism sector maximises the benefits, boosting investment, jobs and growth. Domestic tourism will benefit from a 20.12 per cent discount initiative recently announced by Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt and during a trip to New York last September the Prime Minister launched the GREAT campaign which will focus on promoting globally everything the UK has to offer. The campaign will showcase the opportunities to invest in the UK and help to attract millions of extra visitors.

Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt added:

> ""London 2012 gives us an opportunity to showcase the best of Britain to the world and what this country has to offer. From our beautiful countryside to historic sites, sporting venues to our amazing cultural offer Britain really does have something for everyone. I am confident that we will put on a sporting spectacular this summer with some magical, medal moments that we will never forget and that will inspire many young people to get involved in sport.""

Sports in the UK will also receive a boost as part of the Olympic legacy with many of the world-class venues being opened up to local communities and initiatives to support sport in schools, communities and elite athletes continuing after the Games.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1701109,Fair deal for Travellers and the settled community,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has announced plans to give travellers who play by the rules the same rights as other mobile home residents and incentives to encourage councils to provide more authorised sites. At the same time, top-down Whitehall planning rules on travellers which Ministers believe has undermined community cohesion and harmed the countryside will be scrapped.

The plans announced by Mr Pickles include:

  * **Stronger tenancy rights on authorised council sites** - Travellers on official local authority sites will benefit from changes to legislation that will give them the same rights and responsibilities as residents on other mobile home sites.
  * **New incentives to build authorised sites** - The Government has announced that councils will be given incentives through the New Homes Bonus scheme to deliver new housing. Ministers are announcing today that this will include authorised traveller site so that councils will get financial benefits for building authorised sites where they are needed.
  * **Abolition of Whitehall guidance** - Ministers are today announcing their intention to revoke what they regard as flawed Whitehall Planning Circulars on travellers. The planning rules have been criticised by many local councils, some of whom have said this has compelled them to build on the countryside and compulsorily purchase land. Such rules have, Ministers believe, undermined community cohesion by creating a perception amongst many people of 'different' planning rules for the travelling community and for the settled community. Planning rules should be the same for all.
  * **Stronger powers for councils to tackle unauthorised development** - Mr Pickles is looking at ways to strengthen the powers available to councils to more effectively tackle unauthorised development, which cause tensions within communities. This will include action against speculative, unscrupulous private developers.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""Unauthorised developments have created tensions between travellers and the settled population. We want to redress the balance and put fairness back into communities.
> 
> ""Like the rest of the population, the majority of travellers are law-abiding citizens and they should have the same chance of having a safe place to live and bring up their children. These changes will put travellers who play by the rules on an equal footing.
> 
> ""But at the same time, we will not sit back and allow people to bypass the planning rules that everyone else has to abide by. That's why we will strengthen the powers that councils have to enforce against breaches of planning rules and tackle the abuse of the planning system.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2096316,"First volunteering day marks the start of ""A Year of Service""","![Logo for ](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2098422.jpg)Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today joined faith leaders at a special volunteering event held by members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the UK to launch the start of A Year of Service.

A Year of Service is a unique programme where nine faith communities are leading a series of volunteering days throughout the year, encouraging people of all faiths and people of non-religious beliefs to come together to help improve their local neighbourhoods. This first event is being led by the Baha'i Faith, where representatives of the nine faith communities are joining young people wrapping donated gifts for a London homeless shelter.

As highlighted in the Government's Creating the Conditions for Integration paper published last week, A Year of Service exemplifies the principle of selfless service to others and is an opportunity to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in a practical way - service being an important theme of Her Majesty's long reign. Each of the days is focusing on a different social action project, such as community clean ups, planting trees in a local park, or cooking lunches for those in need.

The private sector is invited to get involved and business-led charity Business in the Community (BiTC) is encouraging businesses across the country to support A Year of Service.

Also announced today is a new category in the national Faith Through a Lens photography competition, which this year will feature photographs taken by a Year of Service volunteers, celebrating their achievements of volunteers and capturing the wide range of activities that will take place during the year.

Speaking ahead of the launch at the National Baha'i Centre, Eric Pickles said:

> ""A Year of Service is a wonderful celebration of the practical contribution that faith groups make to enrich their neighbourhoods and improve the lives of those around them. We would be poorer by far without their contribution, whether that's running the local youth club; offering help to the homeless; or providing meals to the vulnerable.
> 
> ""Churches, temples, mosques and synagogues are keen to reach out beyond their own walls. Inter-faith activity is thriving and I'd encourage everyone to get involved in an event this year and remember to take a photo.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell will this evening join volunteers in delivering the donated gifts to a homeless shelter based in St Dionis's Church, Parson's Green, run by West London Churches Homeless Concern.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Our faith groups are a huge force for good in building strong communities with thousands of unsung individuals donating significant amounts of their free time to improve the lives of those around them. These people are instrumental in getting others involved in local social action.
> 
> ""Volunteering days like today is when A Year of Service will really come into its own, bringing people together and also helping to improve the neighbourhoods they live in.""

The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the UK said:

> ""A Year of Service is a wonderful initiative that promotes collaboration and a spirit of selfless service - two qualities greatly needed in today's world. The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the UK is deeply honoured to host the initiative's launch event during the festival of Ayyam-i-Ha - a time of joy, giving and hospitality - and to join hands with Secretary of State Eric Pickles, religious leaders and many distinguished guests to offer service in the community. We are confident that through unified action at the grassroots we can build a better society, and welcome A Year of Service as an excellent opportunity to advance this process.""

Nick Hurd Minister for Civil Society said:

> ""Faith groups are a powerful tool to catalyse social action, which is why the Cabinet Office has provided grant funding to support A Year of Service. We all want a bigger, stronger society where people get involved and do their bit. There is already a huge amount of good community work going on up and down the country and I would urge people to get involved in the very first A Year of Service - a great way for people of all faiths and of non-religious beliefs to come together to help improve their community.""

The website for A Year of Service provides details of each volunteering day (or days), ideas for activities, background on why volunteering is important to each faith and suggestions as to where people can get involved and go for advice.

### Notes to editors

1. Further details on a Year of Service can be found at: [www.ayearofservice.org.uk](http://www.ayearofservice.org.uk) (external link).

2. A 'Year of Service' consists of 12 special days throughout 2012 - coinciding with a religious festival of a different faith or an existing volunteering Day, plus a National Celebration in central London on 26 and 27 November during Inter Faith Week. Each special day will focussing on a particular theme and each faith in turn are holding volunteering activities involving everyone in their community. A 'Year of Service' project might be a church that not only encourages its own congregation to contribute food during Harvest Festival, but also invites the local mosque and a Sikh Gurdwara to join in. In a business, a staff Buddhist network could lead employees in projects to improve their local environment.

3. The project reflects and involves through a Reference Group the major faith communities: Baha'i, Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian faiths.

4. The Baha'i Faith is comparatively new: its Founder, Baha'u'llah, lived in Iran in the 19th century. It teaches the oneness of religion and promotes the unity of all people, and is prominent in social and economic development efforts worldwide, in such areas as health, literacy, and human rights education. The community in the UK numbers at least 6,000, and is actively involved in inter faith dialogue, social action, and educational processes that seek to raise the capacity of people from all backgrounds to contribute towards the betterment of society. Ayyam-i-Ha is a time of celebration, hospitality, charity, worship, gift-giving, and spiritual preparation for fasting in the Baha'i community. It lasts from 26 February to 1 March - four days, or five days in a leap year - and aligns the Baha'i calendar of 19 months, each of 19 days, with the solar calendar. More information on the Baha'i Faith in the UK can be found at: [www.bahai.org.uk](http://www.bahai.org.uk/) (external link).

5. The Faith through a Lens competition is open to people aged 16 or over, who are resident in the UK and are amateur photographers. Further details can be found at: [www.faiththroughalens.co.uk](http://www.faiththroughalens.co.uk/) (external link). Winners of the A Year of Service category will be announced at the National Celebration for A Year of Service in November 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1993565,Government helping high streets to thrive with support for local shops,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told retailers they were the lifeblood of the British economy and the Government would do everything it could to help them succeed in challenging times.

In a speech to the British Retail Consortium Mr Pickles said shops had ""colossal economic clout""; employing 2.9 million people and providing more than one in ten jobs across the UK. Nine per cent of all VAT-registered businesses are retailers. He highlighted the new Westfield in Stratford as an example of retail investment turning an area's fortunes around by bringing visitors to the East End and creating some ten thousand permanent jobs.

### Local shops part of area's identity

Shops were also often part of a local area's identity, he added, whether it was the local market in the town square or the village shop used by the whole community.

But retailers are facing challenging times with the downturn biting and the internet accounting for 8 per cent of sales. Town centre vacancies have doubled in the last two years.

Mr Pickles said local shops and high street are playing a vital part in the Government's priority plans to renew and reenergise the economy and the Government was committed to helping them succeed. This Department has:

  * **Doubled small business rate relief.** Over the past twelve months, half a million firms have benefited including high street shops, newsagents and cafes.
  * **Provided rapid support** to help shops get back on their feet following the riots in August with small firms able to bid against a twenty million pound fund within days.
  * **Announced plans to change the way business rates work**, so that councils are rewarded for helping small shops thrive and prosper.
  * Plans to focus retail development in town centres through a **'town centre first'** planning policy.
  * A plan to change planning rules to allow councils to provide **more parking spaces in town centres**, to make them able to compete with out-of-town supermarkets.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Retailers are the lifeblood of the British economy, employing more than 2.9 million people and providing more than one in ten jobs. But shops are about more than money. They are part of the fabric of our towns.
> 
> ""It's not Government's job to tell people how to shop. But I want to see local shops thriving and traders prospering on busy high streets.
> 
> ""That's why we've doubled small business rate relief and provided rapid support to help shops get back on their feet following the shameful scenes in August this year. In the future we're ensuring councils will be rewarded for helping local shops prosper.
> 
> ""Shops make places work and this Government use all the tools it has to help local shops do the best they can.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1685494,Hidden victims of recession show need for homeowners to seek help early,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today issued a reminder to struggling homeowners to seek help early to have a better chance of staying in their homes.

His call came on the day new research shows that the number of home owners who have given up their home due to financial difficulties has been much higher than solely shown by repossession statistics.

The research from the Centre of Housing Policy (University of York) shows that whilst thousands have lost their home through voluntary or compulsory repossession, many more people have been forced into selling their home, before any court action is taken against them because of financial difficulties.

The research shows that financial difficulties that led to home owners selling up were often triggered by relationship breakdown and other financial commitments such as loans secured on the property. They found that households often took out extra loans, or took the least helpful action to deal with their situation, because they acted without seeking help and advice to tackle their debts.

The findings come as new figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) released today show that repossessions in the second quarter of 2010 were down by 400 compared to the previous quarter, and 20 per cent less than the same time in 2009.

CML have also today confirmed that they are revising down their original forecast for the number of households being repossessed in 2010 from 53,000 to 39,000.

Mr Pickles said that whilst the fall in the number of people losing their homes through official repossession action was welcome, the research demonstrated that many more homeowners had fallen victim to losing their home than is shown up in repossession statistics. He said that the findings strongly underlined the need for early action from homeowners to get help, take control of their finances and give themselves the best chance of avoiding losing their homes.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Today's figures from CML are good news and an encouraging sign that fewer homeowners are facing the real and frightening prospect of repossession. But there is no room for complacency - struggling homeowners must take early advice to have the best chance of staying in their homes.
> 
> ""I am determined that those who need help are able to get it - and that includes the need to tackle the record budget deficit to avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates.
> 
> ""Today's research lays bare the many hidden victims of the recent recession, homeowners who have given up and left home ownership, when getting practical advice before matters got too overwhelming might have kept them in their homes. That's why we are working with organisations like Shelter and Citizens Advice so people know where they can go to get a grip on their finances and can make informed decisions about their future.""

Latest figures also published today show that one of the schemes aimed at helping the most vulnerable homeowners, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme, has helped 2100 households avoid the immediate threat of repossession, with 980 homeowners having completed the full process since the scheme's launch in January 2009.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2009841,It's time to stop leaving problem families in crisis,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today set out his plans to shake up local services as part of the Government's efforts to turn around the lives of 120,000 most troubled families.

These families make up less than one per cent of the population, yet they are costing the economy over £8 billion a year.

Up to 20 local agencies can be involved with the same family, overlapping and sometimes pulling in different directions, with families pushed from pillar to post. Mr Pickles said ""It's expensive. It's ineffective. It's a bad deal all round.""

In a keynote speech to council leaders, Mr Pickles said that when you unchain local agencies from Whitehall bureaucracy it adds up to local energy, local initiative and local innovation.

The Government wants to see more local areas joining up their local services efforts, as evidence shows this can help turn the lives of families around. This Community Budget approach is being rolled out countrywide and will play a vital role alongside other measures to help problem families.

Instead of the traditional single agency silo approach costing local services up to £330,000 per family a year ministers want to see one co-ordinated and integrated intervention at an average of £14,000 per family used. This creates a better service and yearly costs plummet by £70,000.

The Prime Minister has set out his ambition to turn the lives of these families around by the end of Parliament. Last week it was announced that Louise Casey CB will spearhead a new troubled families team in the Department for Communities and Local Government to deliver tangible and rapid progress.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The moment some children are born their life chances are simply written off. From day one their lives are defined by the problems that surround them - drugs, alcohol, crime, mental illness and unemployment - they grow up in chaos and their own lives are chaotic.
> 
> ""During the summer riots the whole country got a sudden, unwelcome insight into our problem families - the ones that make misery in their communities and cause misery to themselves.
> 
> ""It's a story of futility and waste. Waste of money. Waste of people. And it has simply got to stop. We are going to stop it. We can no longer afford the luxury of fruitless, uncoordinated investment. The damaged lives and communities.
> 
> ""We need action and results - not endless restating the problem - like getting kids back to schools, adults into employment, stopping criminal behaviour.""

Mr Pickles also challenged councils to push further in their efforts to integrate local services so they work better for residents, reduce waste and deliver better value for money.

In addition the Communities Secretary announced details of how areas can bid to trial two new 'localist' approaches to integrated services. He will describe this dramatic new shift as ""an opportunity to change the future of the way public services are funded and be the thumping heart of your community"".

A Community Budgets prospectus published today sets out the details for how pilots will be selected by the end of the year. Each area will get dedicated support to break through Whitehall's bureaucracy so proposals could be up and running by April 2013.

Two areas will be invited to design and run a public service budget programme controlled at 'neighbourhood level'. A further two areas will design and run a 'whole place' or local level programme to test how all public services can be integrated and managed as a single budget within a council boundary or wider city area.

Each pilot will establish devolved budget and policy making structures to secure better co-ordinated, more efficient services for residents. This can help government to make significant public sector savings, cut red tape and improve policy making.

### Notes to editors

1. One Salford family required 250 interventions in one year including 58 police call-outs and five arrests; five 999 visits to Accident and Emergency; two injunctions; and a Council Tax arrears summons. Their Community Budget led to the £200,000 cost being cut by two thirds. Cost of problem families explained: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviour2](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviour2).

2. Announcement of the new troubled families team: [www.number10.gov.uk/news/new-troubled-families-team/](http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/new-troubled-families-team/) (external link).

3. In June 2011 the Deputy Prime Minister invited councils to sign up for Community Budgets. Around 50 more authorities will get Community Budgets this year and then at least a further 60 in 2012-13. This follows the success of sixteen pioneer areas that have put in place plans to support the first 10,000 families. So far over one hundred and eleven councils are already getting involved in this community budget approach accounting for 70 per cent of problem families across the country.

4. The new Community Budget pilots will be run locally and not by Whitehall - breaking control from Whitehall and the strings that constrain local innovation, the pilots will create a new way of doing business with local leaders and people shaping local services around local needs in a new relationship with Whitehall. All areas and their local public service partners can challenge the way things are currently done and transform the way public services are provided so they more closely meet the needs of those communities, give them more control over those services and provide better services for less.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2126431,Launch of nationwide community music day,"Eric Pickles has called on local bands to take part in 'Bandstand Marathon - Communities in Tune', a nationwide music day which aims to encourage 500 areas across the country to come together and celebrate the final day of the Paralympic Games on 9 September 2012 through a range of free live performances.

The Communities and Local Government Secretary joined three different performers, including, the Brentwood Royal Legion Youth Band in Colchester on Friday to highlight the initiative and give his personal backing to the planned 'Bandstand Marathon'.

The day will showcase as much live performance from as many cultures and communities as possible and events will take place across a wide range of outdoor performance spaces. This could include anything from a steel drum band playing in an historic bandstand in a local park, a piano recital in a shopping centre or a choral choir in a public garden, Mr Pickles made clear.

As highlighted in the Government's recent 'Creating the conditions for integration' paper, the Government is strongly supporting people to play an active part in society, to focus on what they have in common rather than their differences and celebrate what is good about their local area.

Under the theme 'Communities in Tune', the Government is teaming up with organisers Superact and Making Music, providing them with funding to expand and enhance their existing annual Bandstand Marathon day, doubling the length of the local events to four hours, and increasing the number of events from 100 venues last year to a predicted 500 this year.

Speaking at the national launch at Colchester Castle Park, Essex, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""2012 is a great year for the country, with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic and Paralympic Games there is no better time for communities to come together and celebrate. Bandstand Marathon will be a fantastic afternoon of free live entertainment, getting people enthused about a wide range of music and a great opportunity for everyone to celebrate what is good about their local area. The day is also a terrific opportunity to champion our local Bandstands which are very much a part of our cultural heritage and help bring them back to life.""

Superact Director, Nick Smith said:

> ""We are delighted to have received the Department for Communities and Local Government's support for the Bandstand Marathon in 2012 as it has enabled us to massively expand the event in this Olympic year. Thanks to the Department, 2012 will see the 500 events across the UK on 9 September 2012 doubled in length from two to four hours and also enables us, in partnership with Making Music, to train local organisers in planning and delivering the events, adding to the community's ability to come together around a shared love of music.""

Bandstand Marathon is part of the London 2012 Festival, a spectacular 12-week nationwide celebration from 21 June and running until 9 September 2012 bringing together leading artists from across the world with the very best from the UK.

He was speaking at the formal launch of Near Neighbours, a £5million three-year Communities and Local Government funded programme that aims to bring together people from diverse communities and different faiths to get to know each other better and help them improve their local neighbourhoods.

A Near Neighbours small grants fund is now up and running and grants of between £250 and £5000 are being awarded to grass roots groups in four targeted geographical areas.

Among the projects already awarded funding are:

  * Otley Road and Barkerend Environment Project in Bradford, an important space where local people can come together to appreciate and learn more about nature. Near Neighbours funding will support an inter faith, intergenerational group of local residents who will run projects around tree planting and recycling to improve their local area for the benefit of the whole community.
  * The Kingsbridge project in Birmingham run by the Riverside Church, Moseley which has been working to secure the transfer of playing fields from the Council. Kingsbridge will use the area acquired to provide a sports and social centre for their diverse community, which they have identified as a major need.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The work we are celebrating today is the next chapter in the same centuries-old, proud and unbroken tradition of people of faith giving back to local communities. They enrich their neighbourhoods and improve the lives of those around them through practical action.
> 
> ""Too often communities that live side by side don't get together as often as they could to discuss and tackle the issues and challenges that matter to them most. This can lead to isolation and misunderstandings which are not healthy for local communities, when by and large, irrespective of creed or faith most people want the same thing, for their neighbourhoods to be better places to live.
> 
> ""Faith groups play a vital role in our neighbourhoods. We want to give them help to do what they do best. That's why we are funding Near Neighbours as an investment in the future; supporting grass roots groups and projects to allow communities to get on transforming their neighbourhoods for the better.""

Overseen by the Church Urban Fund, Near Neighbours is targeted in four areas: the M62 ""mill towns"" corridor (Bradford, Burnley, and Oldham); Leicester; and selected boroughs and wards in East London and Birmingham. It builds on the good work already out there, recognising that small, local, faith groups know what works best and where money is needed most - often only a small sum - to bring about lasting benefits to their local neighbourhoods.

Each of the four areas has a centre with experience of working with different faith groups, removing the need for any additional red tape. The programme will fund them to undertake new inter faith work alongside partners such as the Christian Muslim Forum to cover the costs of Anglican clergy meeting imams and clergy of other faiths and sharing their experiences and expertise on residential courses. It will also help support a new generation of leaders and young activists - the people who want to make a difference in their community through practical help, such as getting graffiti cleaned up and gardens planted.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2108232,Luton set to benefit from Near Neighbours programme,"Grassroots groups and projects across the country working to improve community relations are to benefit from £240,000 of new funding from the Near Neighbours scheme, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has announced.

Near Neighbours is a highly successful programme that uses the parish infrastructure of the Church of England to bring together people from diverse communities and different faiths in challenging areas to get to know each other better, take action on local issues and help them transform their local neighbourhoods. As well as a small grants fund the programme includes training for community activists, youth leadership projects and clergy twinning schemes.

Luton now joins areas in East and South London, Leicester, Birmingham and the northern towns of Bradford, Burnley and Oldham that have already benefited from the programme since its launch in November last year. These social action projects already up and running are drawing on sport, social media and environmental issues to improve friendships and working relationships across faith boundaries. £60,000 of the funding will be dispersed through small grants to community projects in the Luton area.

As highlighted in the Government's 'Creating the conditions for integration' paper published last month, the Government is supporting people to play an active part in society, improve their local communities.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""I am delighted to see communities taking up Near Neighbours with such enthusiasm. This is a real investment in our shared future and a big step towards achieving a more integrated society focusing on creating the conditions for everyone to live and work successfully alongside each other.
> 
> ""The Church of England is doing a great job supporting grassroots groups and working hard to ensure the success of Near Neighbours in bringing lasting change to local communities. We are determined to support areas such as Luton in their efforts to reduce community tensions.""

The Near Neighbours charity was created by Church Urban Fund and the Archbishop's Council following the award of £5 million by the Department for Communities and Local Government in February 2011. It is administered by the Church Urban Fund. To date the programme has disbursed nearly £400,000 in small grants (£200 to £5,000) to over 100 locally generated projects made possible by £5 million funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government.

### Notes to editors

1. The programme is co-ordinated in the four targeted areas by four local hubs with experience of local community partnership working (the St Philip's Centre, Leicester, the Faithful Neighbourhoods Centre, Birmingham, the Contextual Theology Centre East London and Bradford Churches for Dialogue and Diversity). The programme also works in partnership with the Christian Muslim Forum, the Council of Christians and Jews and the Hindu Christian Forum; and with the Nehemiah Foundation and The Feast.

2. To date the programme has disbursed nearly £400,000 in small grants (£200 to £5,000) to over 100 locally generated projects including:

  * ELT Baptist Church's engagement with young Muslim women. The Churches' programme of activities encourages young Muslim women, predominately from Bangladeshi and Somali backgrounds, to engageme with the wider East London community giving them the support and connections to get involved in wider social action on issues which affect them.

  * North Kirklees Interfaith Council's Youth Short Film Project. The film project is using social media and modern technology to address tensions between young people in Dewsbury from Muslim and Christian backgrounds. Young people are invited to submit short mobile phone videos about life in Dewsbury, the best of which will be edited into a short film to promote a more positive impression of life in the diverse community.

  * Pennine Lancashire Community Farm Community Gardening Project Development. After the success of the Pennine Lancashire Community Farm in Burnley, established to promote community cohesion and sustainable living, their Near Neighbourhoods funding will support work on a second site in a predominantly white British and eastern European area with similar levels of deprivation to the first site. The gardening projects encourage local residents to grow food to use in their own cooking and will support joint events between the two sites and communities.

  * Indika Cultural Centre's Jubilee football tournament. The Hindu-based community group is bringing together London's South Asian communities by organising a football tournament during the Diamond Jubilee bank holidays. Four teams representing the British Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, and Sri Lankan communities will be taking part. It is hoped this first encounters event will lead to further collaboration and relationship building activities between the communities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2019438,More flexibility for councils to reduce Council Tax bills for hard working families and pensioners,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today published for consultation a series of practical measures that give councils extra flexibility to help ordinary families with their council tax bills. The proposals sit alongside a second year of council tax freeze announced earlier this year.

The consultation paper _Technical reforms of council tax_ follows the Local Government Resource Review's commitment to consider what flexibilities local authorities should have to help keep overall council tax levels down. The consultation sets out a series of practical proposals which will help hard-working families and pensioners with their council tax bills.

The proposals include new scope for councils to:

  * **Cut council tax for ordinary families,** by giving councils the flexibility to remove council tax relief on second homes and empty homes, and use the money to keep overall council tax bills down. Second homes currently receive a 10 to 50 per cent discount. There are a range of discounts of up to 100 per cent for empty homes.
  * **Ensure that banks pay their fair share.** Under the proposed changes a bank or building society which repossesses an empty home will be liable for the council tax on that property.

These reforms could allow councils to make up to a £20 reduction in the bill for a typical Band D property in England. Getting empty homes back into use will increase housing supply and tackle properties that can attract squatters and vandalism and blight communities.

The paper also consults on the empty homes premium for long-term properties announced by ministers in September. There are no plans to change the rules on council tax relief currently available for homes left empty because a person has moved into a hospital or care home, or has died, or has moved to provide care to another. These are special circumstances where there is a justification for a home temporarily lying empty. Moreover, councils will be encouraged to use their existing powers to apply discretionary discounts in cases where homes are empty due to other justifiable circumstances - for example, hardship, fire or flooding.

The consultation also proposes changes to modernise the council tax system and address potentially unfair future charges. These include:

  * **More flexibility on payments.** Give local residents a new right to pay their council tax bills in **12 monthly payments,** rather than 10 instalments over a year. This will make it easier for local taxpayers to manage their payments, especially those on fixed incomes, like pensioners.
  * **Encourage the take-up of electronic billing** by reviewing the documents that have to be supplied in hard copy with council tax demand notices. Utility companies routinely offer **discounts for customers who pay by e-billing** and direct debit, but most councils do not. Local taxpayers would still have the right to request hard copy documents for free.
  * **Stopping the ""sun tax"" on solar panels** - ensuring there are no increases in the council tax liabilities of homes as a result of domestic scale photovoltaic solar panels being installed by a third party supplier under a 'rent a roof' scheme. These changes will avoid the imposition of a ""sun tax"" and the need for inspections of homes with solar panels.
  * **Review the ""double taxation""** of self-contained annexes to family homes. Currently, council tax inspectors treat such annexes as a separate property, meaning families get charged twice for the same single property they occupy.

These practical improvements complement other reforms to council tax: confirming there will be no council tax revaluation which would have forced up bills for millions of homes; working with local councils to deliver a two-year council tax freeze; and giving local residents a new right to veto excessive council tax increases.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Council tax bills have more than doubled since 1997. This Government is taking action to keep council tax down, confirmed there will be no council tax revaluation and helped freeze council tax for two years. I want to do more to help everyday families with their cost of living. By treating everyone equally and fairly and removing the special tax breaks for empty homes and second homes, councils have the potential to cut £20 a year off families' council tax bills. Councils should make it easier to pay bills, and offer the same discounts for electronic billing that other companies offer as standard - this will cut paperwork and reduce tax bills.""

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation _Technical reforms of council tax_ can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/technicalreformcounciltax](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/technicalreformcounciltax)

2. The proposed changes include:

> (a) Giving billing authorities power to levy up to full council tax on second homes, currently councils can levy a 10 to 50 per cent discount. Councils can already reduce the second homes discount to just 10 per cent - we propose giving councils the local discretion to charge the normal rate of council tax. The job-related second homes discount (where someone has to live in a dwelling because of their job) would be unaffected. The Government has increased the help the Armed Forces scheme gives for service personnel towards council tax.
> 
> (b) Replacing empty home council tax exemptions Classes A and C with discounts, the amount of which would be for councils to determine - allowing them to reduce the discount from 100 per cent to 0.
> 
> (c) Abolishing empty home council tax Class L exemption (repossessed home), and making mortgagees in possession of empty dwellings (i.e. the banks) liable to council tax in respect of them.
> 
> (d) Seeking views on whether billing authorities should be given the option to levy an ""empty homes premium"" on the council tax payable in respect of properties that have been left empty (for two years or more, for example).
> 
> (e) Setting a default assumption that payment of council tax by instalments will be over 12 months rather than (as is currently the case) 10.
> 
> (f) Allowing councils to publish online the ""Information to be supplied with demand notices"", but with a duty to supply it in hardcopy to any council tax payer requesting it - as an efficiency measure, and to encourage the take-up of electronic billing.
> 
> (g) Eliminating potential tax complications from arrangements involving third party suppliers where solar panels are placed on the roofs of dwellings without coming into the paramount control of the resident.

3. If authorities choose to operate these new flexibilities to maximise revenue in order to relieve upward on council tax, the value would be equivalent to approximately £20 reduction in the bill for a Band D property (averaged across England). In practice, the value will vary considerably between areas, and will of course depend on the discounts actually determined by each billing authority.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2091083,New local pay guidance to help tackle tax avoidance,"Government rules to open up Town Hall pay practices and senior salaries to public scrutiny now include measures to root out any inappropriate tax avoidance arrangements, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander has set out the Government's commitment to tackling all forms of tax avoidance. As local government is also paid from the public purse Mr Pickles has issued new statutory guidance that addresses the matter.

The Localism Act requires councils to publish and be accountable for their pay policies, helping to ensure that local remuneration arrangements - particularly for chief officers - provide value for money for the whole of the public sector.

The Government's associated guidance on _Openness and Accountability in Local Pay_ published today now states that authorities should review the terms of senior appointments, particularly where arrangements could be perceived as seeking to minimise tax payments.

It specifically states that councils should vote on salary packages for employees greater than £100,000 a year. Councils should also publicly justify any big bonuses, above inflation pay rises, or the recruitment of staff already in receipt of public sector retirement or severance money.

Elected councillors have until the end of next month to approve pay policy statements that should include explicit local policies on all the above practices and whether or not they intend to permit any of these sorts of arrangements.

At a time when the public are worried about the cost of living and all parts of the public sector should be making savings, this action will give taxpayers the clearest evidence possible that value for money has been considered in pay policies.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Opening up the pay deals of top Town Hall jobs to public scrutiny will mean taxpayers know with certainty their interests are being protected.
> 
> ""Local people have a right to know whether any Town Halls allow tax arrangements that could short change the public purse; whether bumper bonuses are being awarded to poorly performing workers; or whether pay is being hiked up for execs who've boomeranged from post to post.
> 
> ""The door to council pay practices is being unlocked by the Localism Act - local authorities must now publicly endorse their pay practices by next month. Doing this will reassure residents that local pay is fair, fit for purpose and fully 'democracy proofed'.""

Mr Pickles has previously called for council chief executives earning over £200,000 to take a ten per cent pay cut and those earning £150,000 - more than the Prime Minister - to take a five per cent pay cut. Independent research has found that between January and June 2011 newly appointed chief executives were earning on average 19 per cent less than their predecessors.

### Notes to editors

1. The Localism Act is one of the most radical pieces of legislation to be voted through Parliament - it fundamentally shifts the balance of power to communities and reinforces the importance of strong local democratic rights. Provisions in the Act require local authorities and fire and rescue authorities to approve and publish annually at Full Council (for Fire and Rescue Authorities, a meeting of members), a pay policy statement which authorities will be required to follow, including when setting senior pay. Where councils want to depart from the pay policy, these would need to be referred back to Full Council (or a meeting of members for Fire and Rescue Authorities) to vote on.

2. The Localism Act also includes provision for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on the content and application of senior pay statements. Relevant authorities must have regard to this guidance in the exercise of their functions under the pay accountability provisions. The new pay guidance _Openness and Accountability in Local Pay: Guidance under section 40 of the Localism Act_ can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/guidancelocalpay](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/guidancelocalpay).

3. The statement must include the authority's policies relating to:

> a. the level and elements of remuneration for each chief officer  
b. remuneration of chief officers on recruitment  
c. increases and additions to remuneration for each chief officer  
d. the use of performance related pay for chief officers  
e. the use of bonuses for chief officers  
f. the approach to the payment of chief officers on their ceasing to hold office under or to be employed by the authority, and  
g. the publication of and access to information relating to remuneration of chief officers.

4. The term 'remuneration' covers:

> a. the chief officer's salary or, in the case of a chief officer engaged by the authority under a contract for services, payments made by the authority to the chief officer for those services  
b. any bonuses payable by the authority to the chief officer  
c. any charges, fees or allowances payable by the authority to the chief officer  
d. any benefits in kind to which the chief officer is entitled as a result of the chief officer's office or employment  
e. any increase in or enhancement of the chief officer's pension entitlement where the increase or enhancement is as a result of a resolution of the authority, and  
f. any amounts payable by the authority to the chief officer on the chief officer ceasing to hold office under or be employed by the authority, other than amounts that may be payable by virtue of any enactment.

5. A letter on tax arrangements of public sector appointments can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/taxarrangementsletter](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/taxarrangementsletter).

6. The Secretary of State published _The Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency_ on 29 September 2011. The Code enshrines the principles of transparency and asks councils to follow three principles when publishing data they hold; responding to public demand; releasing data in open formats available for re-use; and, releasing data in a timely way. This includes data on senior salaries and the structure of their workforce. The code can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode).

7. According to the Local Government Employers data from the Joint Negotiating Committee's Salaries and Numbers survey 2008 and Setting Rewards for Top Managers in Local Government, the chief officers' pay bill was £576.5 million and Chief Executives was £50.4 million.

8. The Local Government Chronicle published analysis in January which found that salaries for newly appointed chief executives in January to June 2011 were on average 19 per cent less than their predecessors: for July to December 2011, salaries for newly appointed chief executives were on average 10 per cent less than predecessors.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1666195,New measures to stop 'lobbying on the rates',"Plans to increase town hall transparency and stop the practice of local authorities hiring lobbyists to press-gang Government into pet funding projects or new regulations have been proposed by Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles.

A consultation will be launched to update The Local Authority Publicity Code, which guards against campaigning with public funds. It will include stronger guidance to stop tax payer money from being spent on private lobbying contractors to persuade the public or Government to take a particular view on specific policies.

Ministers believe that using taxpayers' funds on local government campaigns or to lobby government wastes public money as it gets used beyond the local area; public policy is weakened when conducted by private lobbying firms. They are private organisations not subject to Freedom of Information or transparency rules. The government will continue to conduct business with local government through existing direct channels.

The new Government has already set out plans for tougher rules to stop councils using taxpayer-funded town hall newspapers to acting in direct competition with commercial independent rivals.

Mr Pickles has already instructed all his department's quangos, including Ordnance Survey and the Tenants Services Authority, to cancel their contracts with lobbying firms. The Audit Commission's lobbying contract ended in February 2010.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Taxpayer-funded lobbying and propaganda on the rates weakens our democracy. So-called town hall newspapers are already closing down scrutiny from independent local papers. Now lobbyists are being used sidestep transparency laws and shadowy figures are peddling more regulation and special favours.
> 
> ""Local activism and localism don't need lobbyists. If local politicians want to change the way government operates, their council should send a letter or pick up the phone. Councillors can campaign for change at a personal or party political level, rather than throwing away other people's council tax on the corrosive and wasteful practice of government lobbying government. These tough new rules will lower the cost of politics and increase transparency.""

### Notes to editors

1. Subject to consultation the new Government is minded to revise and tighten the _Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity_. The Code was originally introduced in 1988 and amended by the last Government in 2001. It is statutory guidance to local authorities. The Secretary of State is legally obliged to consult on the revised code. [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/coderecommended](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/coderecommended).

2. In a statement to Parliament, (Hansard, 26 July 2010, col. 630W.

This will build on existing rules intended to stop 'propaganda' publicity campaigns.

> 'Andrew Jones: To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government if he will issue guidance to local authorities on the retention and use of lobbying companies for the provision of lobbying and support services to campaign for increased funding.
> 
> Robert Neill: The Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity, to which councils are statutorily required to have regard, states that councils should ensure the greatest cost effectiveness in all their publicity and makes clear that public funds should not be used for publicity campaigns intended to persuade the public to hold a particular view on a question of policy.
> 
> The Code of Recommended Practice is shortly to be updated. Subject to consultation, we are minded to include stronger guidance to stop the wasteful and unhealthy practice of councils, funded by local or national taxpayers, paying for lobbyists to lobby Government. My Department has already issued guidance to its arms length bodies to cancel their contracts with lobbyists.'

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1871038,Radical changes in housing and planning will drive local growth,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has welcomed measures to improve the planning system, action to get the house building industry building again and steps to cut the amount of red tape for councils and business set out in today's Budget.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is at the centre of the Coalition's plans to revive and rebalance the economy. Over the coming months the Communities Secretary will oversee a programme of work to unblock the planning system, boost house building and attract new investment into the market, maintain environmental and countryside protections. The reforms will put local councils, communities and local firms in the lead when it comes to delivering growth.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""The actions set out in today's Budget will create the conditions for growth and put this country back on a strong and stable economic footing. We are unblocking the complex, costly planning system, regenerating redundant sites and putting the brakes on the years of Whitehall micro-management that has tied business up in red tape, slowing and stifling growth.
> 
> ""The current planning system is bureaucratic, we will make it easier to navigate. We have a system plagued by conflict and appeals. We will establish a system where councils, communities and business work together. Instead of fighting against development imposed from Whitehall, local people will have a far greater influence over what is built in their area. We will maintain protection for the Green Belt and the environment - as we are committed to sustainable growth.
> 
> ""Every new home built will create jobs in the UK building industry. Before we took office house building had slumped to its lowest peacetime level since 1924. We are turning this around, providing support for first time buyers, encouraging private investment in housing, accelerating the release of public sector land and putting in place powerful new incentives that will give communities a share in the rewards of growth. Together, these measures to support local jobs and local firms will play a crucial part in the Government's wider work to get the economy back on its feet.""

To get Britain building again the Department for Communities and Local Government will:

  * Make up to £210 million available over the next two years to introduce a new FirstBuy scheme that will help over 10,000 first time buyers in England who are struggling to purchase a home in the market due to large deposit requirements. The FirstBuy scheme, jointly funded with house builders, will provide 20 per cent equity to top up first time buyers own deposit of 5 per cent, enabling buyers to access 75 per cent conventional mortgage.

  * Boost investment in house building, helping to reduce the sectors reliance on mortgage funding. The unfavourable Stamp Duty arrangements for bulk purchases of new build homes will end, making investment in house building more attractive, and tackling a tax distortion which currently favours individual purchases ahead of large scale investment.

  * Consult on proposals to increase housing supply by deregulating the planning system so it is easier for developers to change vacant offices into new homes.

To make sure the right land is available in the right place for development the Department will:

  * Accelerate the release of surplus public sector land supporting the creation of new homes and jobs. The Homes and Communities Agency will lead the way including making use of 'build now, pay later' schemes whereby house builders will be given surplus government land which they will only pay for once properties built on it are sold. The scheme will offer a lifeline to house builders struggling with cash flow problems. Other Government Departments and agencies will follow suit publishing land release programmes shortly and be held to account for the homes and jobs unlocked.
  * Reform the planning system through a range of measures, including the introduction of a powerful new presumption in favour of sustainable development. The answer to development and growth should wherever possible be 'yes', except where this would compromise the key sustainable development principles set out in national planning policy.
  * Remove centrally imposed, top down targets that have dictated levels of development on previously developed land. Present rules are overly prescriptive and have in some cases led to perverse outcomes - e.g. imbalances in provision between blocks of flats and family homes. Councils will be able to identify the most sustainable locations for growth in their areas, having regard to the coalition commitment to protect the environment, including maintaining the Green Belt and other environmental designations.
  * Pilot elements of the land auctions models, starting with public sector land. One of the biggest barriers to development is the shortage of land with planning permission. Auctioning parcels of land with planning permission has the potential to bring forward more land for development, increase competition in development and provide greater certainty for developers. The outcome of the pilot will inform further consideration of the wider land auctions model.
  * Place a new Duty to Cooperate on councils to work together to address planning issues that impact beyond local boundaries such as transport, housing or infrastructure.

To simplify and speed up the planning system and reduce regulatory and other burdens on the house building industry Government will:

  * Condense the near 900,000 words of unwieldy national planning policies into one concise, easy to use document. By the end of this year a new National Planning Policy Framework will set out the Governments key economic, social and environmental objectives and the planning policies to deliver them.
  * Consult on plans to simplify the planning process and streamline the information required to support planning applications. Reduce the complexity of the consents developers need. Introduce a planning guarantee that means that planning applications will not have to spend more than twelve months in total with decision makers, where a timely appeal is made.
  * Adopt a new, less costly zero carbon standard for all homes built after 2016. Central to the nation's commitment to slash carbon emissions, the new standards pave the way for the green transformation of Britain's homes, making them more efficient, warmer and cheaper to run.
  * Work with councils and developers to ensure that the cumulative impact of their local plans and other requirements do not unduly constrain the creation of much needed jobs and homes.

To rebalance the economy, reduce regulation and promote enterprise the Department for Communities and Local Government will:

  * Support the creation of the eleven new local Enterprise Zones announced by the Chancellor. These Zones will benefit from business rate incentives and planning freedoms as well as other deregulation. The Zones are intended to help kick start new investment and drive the creation of new private sector jobs in the local areas. The Department will also oversee a competition to identify the next ten zones that will be announced in the autumn.
  * Extend Small Business Rate Relief - the temporary one-year increase in Small Business Rate Relief which started last October will be extended for a further year (1 October 2011 - 30 September 2012). Helping small shops and businesses grow is a crucial part of rebalancing and rebuilding the economy. This tax break comes at the right time and offers a massive helping hand to small business.
  * Approve two redesigned regeneration projects which had become stalled due to the market downturn that will boost economic growth, and bring much needed new jobs. Originally suspended as part of the review of all spending decisions made since January 2010, the revised Sheffield retail quarter regeneration scheme now offers better value for money for the taxpayer (having secured greater support from the private sector) and is expected to deliver around 4000 net additional constructions jobs and around 1,600 permanent jobs. The wider central Milton Keynes sustainable residential quarter has been redesigned to make it more commercially viable and will deliver 400 homes without increased taxpayer expenditure.
  * Revoke the Two Tier Code in local government which formed part of the Best Value regime. Removing this guidance will make it easier small businesses and voluntary sector groups to succeed in the public service market by levelling the playing field and create more opportunities for innovation and greater economic and employment growth.

Taken together this is a comprehensive package for growth - continuing to deliver on the Government's commitment to get the housing market moving again and to putting councils, local businesses and communities back in the driving seat.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Demand for new homes is still growing, but last year house building slumped to its lowest peacetime level since 1924. This Budget shows we are serious about sorting this out - building more homes and increasing the pace of economic growth, and setting new standards for greener homes.
> 
> ""We've already given communities a reason to say yes to development through the New Homes Bonus, now we're helping house builders deliver the homes this country needs by taking away the upfront costs of buying land. We're also extending a helping hand to first time buyers, and 10,000 people will benefit will from help with their deposits so they can get a foot on the housing ladder.""

Decentralisation and Planning Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""The current over-centralised planning system has become one of the greatest obstacles to growth in Britain, shutting out opportunities for development and burdening business with bureaucracy and red tape. Every reform to planning in today's Budget is designed to reverse that position and recalibrate the system to support, rather than hinder economic growth and sustainable development. These measures will help create a planning system fit for the challenge of recovery and rebuilding Britain's economy, while at the same time maintaining our commitment to protect the Green Belt and environment.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1794155,Revolutionary new rights for communities will protect and transform local services,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today announced a package of powerful new rights for communities to challenge services and preserve local assets.

The new Community Rights measures are yet another leap towards localism and the decentralisation of power from Whitehall.

The Localism Bill, due to be announced on Monday (13 December), will enshrine in law rights for community and voluntary groups to draw on when determining what happens in their local area.

They are:

  * **Community Right to Buy**. Local groups will have a legal right to nominate any vital community asset including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. If a listed asset goes on the open market, its sale will be delayed triggering a 'community countdown' that will give people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to bid.
  * **Community Right to Challenge**. Opening the door to a transformation in the way that local public services are run, Right to Challenge gives community or voluntary sector groups, as well as parish councils and council employees delivering the service, new powers to challenge and take over a local service. This could include running children's centres, social care services and even improving local transport links. Under the new law, councils must respond to this challenge and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. If the proposal is turned down the council must publish the reasons for this. This new right puts voluntary and charity groups on the front foot when it comes to running public services and has the potential to open up new revenue for them.

Last week, Mr Pickles announced new rights for communities to shape the development of the communities in which they live, through the creation of neighbourhood plans. The Localism Bill will radically reform the planning system so local people have a greater say and influence over what their home town will look like in the future.  
   
Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, said:

> ""This powerful series of measures puts new rights in law for people to protect, improve and even run important frontline services. For too long people have been powerless to intervene as vital community resources disappear from their areas. The Community Rights measures will put control back where it belongs - with the people at the heart of our villages, towns and cities.
> 
> ""The Rights are also a massive opportunity for the community and voluntary sector to demonstrate their innovation and the new ideas they can bring to the table for better, cost effective services.""

Local facilities have been closing down all over the country, leaving towns and villages without vital amenities. Small community groups that are willing to take over local assets often find that they lack the time and resources to get a plan together and compete with the might and muscle of big business and developers, who can throw significant time and resource behind projects.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark, added:

> ""Voluntary and community groups already successfully provide services including education, social care and tackling worklessness. But there are many more groups who have been locked out or passed over in favour of the same old way of doing things. The government wants to see councils making the most of the talents and ingenuity of these organisations and this new measure will make sure that good ideas get a proper hearing.
> 
> ""The new rights intend to level the playing field and make it easier for voluntary groups to move from the sidelines to centre stage when it comes to delivering services as part of the Big Society"".

The Right to Challenge legislation gives voluntary, community and charitable groups, as well social enterprises, parish councils and local authority employees, the legal right to express an interest to run a service. Councils must respond to these challenges and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. Councils can then put the proposals to the test about how the service would work. 

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell, said:

> ""These groundbreaking measures puts communities at the heart of decision making for protecting vital frontline services and puts them on the front foot for putting in an offer if they come up for closure.""

### Notes to editors

1. For examples of community groups and civic societies who have already taken action in their local areas, please contact the DCLG press office.

2. These measures will be included in the Localism Bill, due to be announced on Monday 13 December. Further details on the measures will be set out in secondary legislation.

3. The Community Right to Buy will require local authorities to maintain a list of sites of community value put forward for consideration by communities. The local authority will assess the suggestions before recording on the list. When listed land comes up for disposal (either the freehold or a long leasehold), communities will be given the chance to develop a bid and raise the capital to buy the asset.  They will then be in a better position to bid to buy the asset when it comes on the market at the end of the moratorium.

4. This will help local communities to save sites which are important to the community, which will contribute to tackling social need and building up resources in their neighbourhood. The Bill will provide the framework for the Right, the detail of which will be set out in secondary legislation, and subject to public consultation in the new year.

5. The Community Right to Challenge will enable voluntary, community and charitable groups, as well social enterprises, mutuals, co-operatives, parish councils and local authority employees looking to deliver the service as a new employee-led organisation, to express an interest in running a local authority service. This may trigger a procurement exercise for the service in which the challenging organisation can participate alongside other bidders.

6. The measure includes a minimum period (to be set out in secondary legislation) between an expression of interest being accepted and a procurement exercise starting. This will enable public sector workers, where they are not the challengers, to decide whether they want to bid to run the service, and to organise themselves to do this. This should also assist smaller and new voluntary sector organisations. We are also proposing that we require local authorities to consider the relevant and proportionate social impacts of both expressions of interest and bids.

7. These measures ensure that the right to challenge better supports the Government's work on public sector workers and its objectives to increase the involvement of the voluntary sector in delivering public services.

8. The local authority will need to publish its response to the expression of interest and set out reasons where it decides not to take a proposal forward. This will ensure that decision making is transparent and the council is accountable to local people for its decision.

9. Right to Challenge follows from the Right to Provide announcement by the Cabinet Office on Wednesday 17 November. Right to Provide means that public service employers will be expected to accept suitable proposals from front line staff who want to take over and run their services as mutual organisations.  
[www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/big-society-plans-better-public-services](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/big-society-plans-better-public-services) (external link).

10. The Government will introduce a new right for communities to shape their local areas by creating neighbourhood plans, and introduce powerful new incentives to encourage local communities to approve sustainable development. The new neighbourhood plans will be flexible so communities will be able to determine the issues or areas to cover and what level of detail they want to go into.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1774345,Shine a light on spending to save taxpayers' money,"Eric Pickles today continued his drive for transparency in Government by publishing his department's spending over £500, and called for councils to follow suit in opening up their books. Such openness will increase democratic accountability and help councils cut wasteful spending.

> ""The sunlight of openness may be uncomfortable for some, but it will expose how taxpayers' money is being wasted and help protect frontline services and keep council tax down.""

In the latest in a series of transparency initiatives, the Department for Communities and Local Government have published their spending over £500 online for the second quarter of 2010-11 (July-September) - allowing the public to scrutinise how taxpayer's money has been spent.

Today, every central government department will be publishing data above £25,000 from November to shine a spotlight on spend and root out waste and duplication. However, having set the bar at £500 for town halls, Mr Pickles believes his own department should play by those same rules and has acted ahead of deadline to start regularly publishing its figures at the lower limit, including publishing information for the last two years.

Although these figures cover the period since the new Government took office, much of the spend in this quarter relates to commitments made by the previous administration, as the figures reflect when an invoice is received from the supplier, rather than when the actual expenditure was incurred. Some ongoing expenditure is also tied into long-term contracts signed by the previous administration.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""It is essential that both Whitehall and every town hall can justify to the taxpayer every penny they spend and that's why my department is leading the way in publishing all our spending over £500.
> 
> ""What I now want to see is every local authority opening their books up to the public gaze, to increase accountability and help save money. The sunlight of openness may be uncomfortable for some, but it will expose how taxpayers' money is being wasted and help protect frontline services and keep council tax down.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2065499,Start of A Year of Service celebrating faith-inspired local volunteering,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today announced that throughout 2012, faith communities will lead a series of volunteering days encouraging communities to come together to help improve their local neighbourhoods.

Recognising the role of faith in inspiring charitable work, the Department for Communities and Local Government is supporting a Year of Service. During the course of 2012, nine faith communities will in turn hold volunteering days, inviting people of other faiths and people of non-religious beliefs to join in. Each of the days will focus on a different social action theme, such as 'community clean ups', planting trees in a local park, or cooking lunches and could be based around an existing religious festival like Lent or the Sikh festival commemorating the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev, or an existing volunteering day such as the Jewish-led Mitzvah Day or the Hindu-led National Sewa Day. 

A Year of Service will also be an opportunity for faith communities to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in a practical way - service being an important theme of Her Majesty's long reign.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Faith is a great motivator, and throughout the year people from different faiths regularly give something back, volunteering for projects that benefit individuals in need or their local neighbourhood. From donating food at the Christian Harvest festival, cleaning up a local park for Mitzvah Day or fund raising during Ramadan.
> 
> ""We want to help them do what they do best, recognising that just a little support can make a big difference. The Year of Service is a chance to link these great efforts together throughout the year, strengthen the existing work carried out by faith groups and encourage greater levels of volunteering in neighbourhoods and among businesses, led by individual faith communities but involving people of all faiths and none.""

The private sector is also being encouraged to get involved and business-led charity Business in the Community is encouraging businesses across the country to back the Year of Service.

A new website, run for A Year of Service by Mitzvah Day, will provide details of each volunteering day, ideas for activities, background on why volunteering is important to each faith and suggestions as to where people can get involved and go for advice.

### Notes to editors

1. Further details on a Year of Service can be found at: [http://ayearofservice.org.uk/](http://ayearofservice.org.uk/)   
2. The project reflects and involves through a Reference Group the major faith communities: Baha'i, Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian faiths. Business in the Community, the Church of England, the Coexist Foundation, the Inter Faith Network for the UK, the Faith based Regeneration Network, and Mitzvah Day are offering advice through a steering group supported by the Government.  
3. A 'Year of Service' will consist of 12 special days throughout 2012 - coinciding with a religious festival of a different faith, plus one national celebratory event. Each special day will focus on a particular theme and each faith in turn will encourage volunteering activities involving everyone in their community. A 'Year of Service' project might be a church that not only encourages its own congregation to contribute food during Harvest Festival, but also invites the local mosque and a Sikh Gurdwara to join in. In a business, a staff Buddhist network could lead employees in projects to improve their local environment.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1967550,Support for long-term recovery in Tottenham and Croydon,"A £20 million enterprise and growth package for Tottenham and Croydon that will kickstart economic regeneration, support business and deliver new job opportunities has been announced by the Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today.

The London Enterprise Fund is intended to provide specific, targeted support for Tottenham and Croydon to arrest and reverse economic decline, provide immediate investment and boost the local economies.

Tottenham and Croydon bore the brunt of the recent disturbances. The riots served to compound existing economic pressures in what are already challenging business environments.

The flexible, unringfenced funding that the Communities Secretary is making available today is intended to address the long standing barriers to growth in these two specific areas. It will support them in maximising their potential, establishing economic identities that will put them on the map and creating apprenticeships and job opportunities for local residents.

The experience of the two boroughs, compared to others in west and central London, shows how growth across the capital in recent years has been uneven. Ministers want to ensure that all boroughs are able to benefit from growth and believe that the funding announced today will help achieve this.

The Government will make available £20m of funding to the Greater London Authority. This will enable the Mayor and partners to get started immediately to work with the areas to develop plans. The proposals will be worked up further with the boroughs concerned but it is anticipated that the money may be used to:

  * **Acquire and redevelop land where it will aid development and get businesses back on their feet quickly**. The Greater London Authority will consider land acquisition where it enables and stimulates commercial growth and success including increasing footfall.
  * **Bring forward investment in transport in Tottenham and Enfield to establish the infrastructure that will underpin growth**. Including measures to reduce congestion, improvements to the rail station and reduce the severance of the area by the West Anglia Main Line.
  * **Restore and regenerate Croydon as a retail commercial centre**. The town centre has undergone steady decline over the last 20 years. There are significant opportunities to develop new commercial and residential properties and attract new commercial space around the New Town and East Croydon station.
  * **Create employment with new businesses, new jobs and Apprenticeships targeted at local residents**. Investment in the physical regeneration will create new jobs and skills opportunities for local people
  * **Invest in business rate relief for local start ups and new investment**. Targeted on businesses and sectors that will increase the competitiveness and economic vitality of each area.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Just as we want the whole of the country to share in the benefits of economic growth so too do we want the whole of the capital to be thriving. London is a success story but it is a story that reads very differently depending on which borough you are in. This immediate investment will breathe new life into both Tottenham and Croydon, enable them to get to grips with the unique challenges they face and move swiftly and quickly to maximise their own potential for economic success.""

The Communities Secretary was joined in Tottenham today by the Mayor of London to announce this package of support.

Boris Johnson said:

> ""We will rebuild and repair every part of our city that has been damaged and help London's businesses get back on their feet. For the most badly affected areas, Tottenham and Croydon, it is vital we also use the opportunity to deliver long term improvements and create new jobs and skills that will benefit these communities for generations to come. With this support from Government, we can not only restore these town centres but create better, more prosperous places to live, work and invest in.""

The £20 million funding will be made available over the next three years for specific, swift action that will deliver longer term regeneration. It comes in addition to the £50 million recovery funding the Government announced last week to give immediate support to areas across the country affected by the disturbances and help them get back on their feet. The London Enterprise Fund is closely aligned with the Mayor of London's £50 million high street improvement package announced last week that will ensure that areas right across the capital are able to access support.

The tailored package of support for Tottenham and Croydon comes on the day that the Government has announced 11 new Enterprise Zones to accelerate local growth as part of the Plan for Growth. The press notice is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1967595](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1967595).

Notes to editors

1. The Mayors office will be working closely with the Department for Communities and Local Government, Boroughs and local representatives to agree funding priorities and proposals. The decisions will be made in partnership with local councils and those communities affected. All proposals will have to demonstrate value for money in terms of the benefits to affected areas.

2. The £20m London Enterprise Fund announced today will complement the £50 million fund that the Mayor of London announced last week to help make major long term improvements to the capital's town centres and high streets damaged by the recent disturbances ensuring that all parts of the capital are able to access financial support.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1967563,Tax relief and funding now available to help our high streets get back to business,"Councils affected by recent rioting can immediately apply for money from a new multi-million pound fund, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has announced. The measures include tax relief on council tax and business rates to help local shops and residents get back on their feet.

In a letter to council leaders, Mr Pickles has given details of how councils can apply for the money and what the funding can be used for. He also pledged that the process would be quick and simple, with a minimum of red tape, and the money will be transferred quickly from central government to where it's needed.

The one-off funding package will help rebuild communities, open up shops and repair buildings which were damaged, make sure people who lost their homes are re-housed, and help councils get their areas get back to business. It will also help fund local council tax relief for residents whose homes have been damaged, and business rate relief for local firms and local shops.

  * A £10 million Recovery Scheme is assisting councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe and clean again, and a £20 million High Street Support Scheme is giving grants to local firms affected by the riots for out-of-pocket expenses. Both funds are now open for bids from local authorities. Councils can spend immediately in their areas, and reclaim the money from central government. These schemes are in addition to the existing Bellwin Scheme, and not subject to any minimum threshold.
  * Individuals, homeowners and local firms can also claim compensation for property damage under the Riot Damages Act, and the Government is extending the period for claims to 42 days. This will help provide support for uninsured buildings.
  * The Government will meet councils' immediate costs for helping people who have had to leave their home as a result of the rioting. Homelessness advisers from the Department have been working closely with the areas affected by the riots and the councils now claim this funding back from the Department for Communities and Local Government.
  * The Department has unveiled details of plans to ensure that landlords can take action against tenants who wreck communities beyond the immediate neighbourhood of their home. A consultation has now been launched on allowing landlords to seek to evict tenants convicted of the sort of criminality seen in the recent rioting - wherever that criminality occurs. The consultation also proposes to speed up the process for evicting offenders.

As well as providing immediate support for the recovery from the riots, the Department for Communities and Local Government will lead cross-Government work in the longer term to improve integration and secure economic recovery and regeneration in areas which have fallen behind.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""The Government is giving a helping hand to our high streets, and getting them back to business. I also encourage local residents to do their bit, by supporting local shops with their custom.
> 
> ""We're ensuring councils have the backing and financial support they need to get local firms and local communities in their area get back on their feet. There is immediate funding now available, including relief from paying council tax and business rates for those badly affected.""

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

> ""We want to do all we can to help those affected. I and my colleagues have been out meeting those who have lost their livelihoods and listening to the problems these businesses face.
> 
> ""The High Street Support Scheme is designed to get individual businesses and communities back on their feet quickly, targeting the specific streets where businesses and households suffered most as a result of the disturbances. I'd encourage any small business affected by the disturbances to contact their local authority and make the most of the assistance available.""

3. The £10 million Recovery Scheme is funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government (£6 million) and Her Majesty's Treasury (£4 million). The £20 million High Street Support Scheme is funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government (£7 million), Department for Business Innovation and Skills (£7m) and Her Majesty's Treasury (£6 million).

4. The Recovery Scheme provides grants to local authorities to help them with the clean up costs. The period allowed for the clean up expenditure is until 5 October 2011, with claims needing to reach the Department for Communities and Local Government by 7 November 2011. Expenditure must have been incurred by a local authority taking action to safeguard life or property or to prevent suffering or severe inconvenience in the community as a direct result of the riots. Normal salary or wages, or capital and insurable costs will not be eligible.

5. The £20 million High Street Support Scheme is available to councils to provide grants to local businesses to alleviate specifically the impact of the recent widespread public disorder on affected businesses. Local authorities are required to submit applications for the total anticipated costs of the scheme by 7 November 2011, with supporting documentation. Local authorities will have discretion on the maximum payments to individual businesses with funding from the scheme. The Scheme will help fund the cost of hardship business rate that would be normally borne by local authorities (25 per cent of the cost). In addition to the Scheme, the remaining 75 per cent will also be funded by central government.

6. Small businesses can also claim grants from the High Street Support Scheme for the costs of the business recovery not covered by their insurance or the Riot Damages Act. This may include things like emergency repairs, replacement of essential assets, security measures, and marketing to show potential customers that they are 'open for business'.

7. In addition, any individual, homeowner or small business that has suffered damage to or loss of their buildings or property as a result of rioting, can seek compensation under the Riot Damages Act. Importantly this compensation is paid to the uninsured too. It is normally the case that claims must be received within 14 days, but to give people more time to submit these claims we will extend the period to 42 days. We will urge the police to respond helpfully and swiftly to all legitimate claims, and the Government is working closely with forces, to ensure they have the funds they need to meet the costs of the operation itself and any claims that they may receive under the Riot Damages Act.

8. The Recovery Scheme and the High Street Support Scheme are in addition to the long-standing Bellwin Scheme, which can compensate local authorities for extraordinary costs above a set threshold. Unlike Bellwin, the two schemes being rolled out are not subject to any minimum threshold.

9. Applications for re-housing costs must be received by 30 November 2011. The maximum payment to individual households is limited to £5,000, although discretion will be applied where exceptional costs have been incurred. The funding will be provided through the existing homelessness funding mechanism.

10. The new consultation on anti-social behaviour in social housing can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourconsult).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1899161,Ten ways to tackle council fraud and recover £2 billion a year,"A new ten point counter-fraud blueprint for tackling criminals and dishonest people who are costing the country billions of pounds in fraudulent local government claims was published today by Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles.

According to the National Fraud Authority Annual Fraud Indicator, Local government could be saving taxpayers £2.1 billion a year by cracking down on fraud in housing tenancy; procurement; pay, pensions and recruitment; council tax; grant; and blue badge schemes. Money currently lost to fraud and error costs every household in England almost £100 a year.

The ten point checklist was compiled, at the request of Mr Pickles, by experts in the National Fraud Authority. The recommendations include councils using credit rating agencies to stop tax evasion and benefit fraud; staff background checks to prevent fraudsters and organised criminals infiltrating key posts.

The Government's Counter Fraud Task Force was launched last year to develop a new strategic approach to tackling fraud across the public sector with a focus on prevention. It will report in May.

Many councils and housing associations are already tackling fraud and error in housing tenancy claims with the departments help. £19 million has been committed to 51 councils to help recover unlawfully occupied homes. Last year they recovered nearly 1,600 properties worth around £240 million.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""It's time to get tough and take on the fraud cons. At a time when we need to cut the national deficit and government waste, cleaning up fraud could save the taxpayer over £2 billion in recovered cash currently being fraudulently stolen or lost to tax cheats.
> 
> ""Better prevention, detection and recovery of fraud will help reduce the financial pressure on councils and help protect frontline services. Today I am publishing the top ten plays for cracking down on council finance fraud.
> 
> ""Councils should carry out better credit checks through credit rating agencies before giving over discounts or benefits. They should properly vet staff in key positions and put stricter controls on who can use the council credit card.""

Mike Haley, Director of Public Sector Fraud, National Fraud Authority said:

> ""At a time when councils are attempting to protect front line services, fraud can no longer be tolerated. Substantial savings can be made, as demonstrated by the best local authorities, and reducing fraud can make a significant difference to local government finances. This ten-point plan, based on local authority best practice, is a starting point in helping councils get a grip on fraud.""

Top ten tips for tackling local authority fraud:

> 1. Measure exposure to fraud risk;  
2. More aggressively pursue a preventative strategy;  
3. Make better use of data analytics and credit reference agency checks to prevent fraud;  
4. Adopt tried and tested methods for tackling fraud in risk areas - such as blue badge scheme misuse;  
5. Follow best practice to drive down Housing Tenancy and Single Person Discount fraud;  
6. Pay particular attention to high risk areas such as procurement and grant awards;  
7. Work in partnership with service providers to tackle organised fraud across local services;  
8. Maintain specialist fraud investigative teams;  
9. Vet staff to a high standard to stop organised criminals infiltrating key departments;  
10. Implement national counter fraud standards developed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.

Estimates indicate that over 400,000 people could be wrongly claiming for single person discount at a cost of £100 million a year to councils in lost council tax. Birmingham City Council has identified £6.8 million worth of fraudulent and incorrect claims for single person council tax discounts.

Some councils are already seeing the benefits of using credit rating agencies. Cheshire East Council found nearly 2000 people had wrongly claimed using Experian credit data. It cost £80,000 but will recover half a million pounds in new income.

Kent County Council is pioneering a contract framework for credit rating agencies which all councils can buy into. This will keep costs down and tackle those that are wrongly claiming services. Mr Pickles believes other councils should take advantage of Kent's example and sign up to it.

Local Government employs around 2 million permanent, temporary and agency staff. Ealing found that 6 per cent failed proper vetting checks but that the figure was higher for temporary staff at 13 per cent.

One council found an agency worker put in charge of a large budget had set up a fictitious company and made false claims totalling £110,000. The person had used a false CV and was later sentenced to two years in prison. The insurance company refused to pay compensation.

London councils have been targeted by a group of sophisticated and organised false identity fraudsters using fake passports to falsely claim £700,000 of services. Oxford Council hired a dedicated fraud officer last year and recovered 25 properties in the first six months. In 15 of these cases the unlawfully sub-letting tenant was still claiming housing benefit, the total cost of which was £1500 per week.

The Department for Communities and Local Government has committed £19 million to helping 51 councils tackle social housing fraud.

### Notes to editor

1. Last year £22 billion of Housing and Council Tax Benefit was paid out by councils. They detected around £99 million worth of benefit fraud, over £15 million worth of council tax fraud, and £21 million worth of other types of fraud including false insurance claims, and abuse of the disabled parking blue badge scheme.

2. In a record-breaking year for tenancy fraud detection, almost 1,600 social housing properties that had been unlawfully sub-let were recovered in 2010. But it is estimated that as many as 50,000 houses and flats countrywide may still be occupied illegally.

3. Housing tenancy fraud is now one of the most significant frauds affecting the country's economy - temporary accommodation for homeless families costs councils nearly £1 billion a year, an average of £18,000 for each family.

4. The ten point checklist compiled by the National Fraud Authority is based on pockets of good practice identified through the organisations current local government counter fraud programme. The National Fraud Authority's 'Guide to tackling housing tenancy fraud' is available here: [www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/nfa/WhatAreWeSaying/Pages/fraud-news-may11-Pickles-Ten-ways-to-tackle-council-fraud-and-recover-%C2%A32bn-a-year.aspx](http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/nfa/WhatAreWeSaying/Pages/fraud-news-may11-Pickles-Ten-ways-to-tackle-council-fraud-and-recover-%C2%A32bn-a-year.aspx) (external link).

5. The National Fraud Authority was set up following the Government's 2006 Fraud Review. It is tasked with making the nation a more hostile environment for fraudsters, whether they are targeting Government, private enterprise individuals or the voluntary sector. In January 2010, the National Fraud Authority led a cross government task force review of fraud against the public sector and since then has driven tackling fraud against both central and local government. The National Fraud Authority supports the Cabinet Office Counter Fraud Taskforce and works closely with local government and individual 'pathfinder' authorities to address the fraud affecting the public purse. For more information contact Orna Joseph on 0203 356 1035 or visit: [www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/nfa](http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/nfa) (external link).

6. The Department for Communities and Local Government sits on the National Fraud Authority's Local Government Oversight Board, which is currently consulting local authorities across England and Wales to establish a counter fraud action plan to help identify key risk areas and drive down the levels of fraud in local government. It will be published in November.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1700760,Time for a fair deal for the Travelling and settled community,"Travellers who play by the rules will get the same rights as other mobile home residents and could benefit from more authorised sites under plans announced today by Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles. At the same time, top-down Whitehall planning rules on travellers which Ministers believe has undermined community cohesion and harmed the countryside will be scrapped.

### Stronger tenancy rights on authorised council sites

Travellers on official local authority sites will benefit from changes to legislation that will give them the same rights and responsibilities as residents on other mobile home sites. Travellers who abide by the terms of their pitch agreement will have greater protection against eviction, and have the same rights and responsibilities as other social tenants.

### New incentives to build authorised sites

The Government has announced that councils will be given incentives through the New Homes Bonus scheme to deliver new housing. Ministers are announcing today that this will include authorised traveller sites. This means that councils will get financial benefits for building authorised sites where they are needed. This will ensure that all types of authorised residential developments are treated equally.

### Abolition of Whitehall guidance

The Government has already freed councils from the top-down Regional Strategies and the associated building targets; this now allows councils to decide for themselves how many traveller pitches are necessary in their area according to local need and historic demand.

Following through on this policy, Ministers are today announcing their intention to revoke what they regard as flawed Whitehall Planning Circulars on travellers. The planning rules have been criticised by many local councils, some of whom have said this has compelled them to build on the countryside and compulsorily purchase land.

Such rules have, Ministers believe, undermined community cohesion by creating a perception amongst many people of 'different' planning rules for the travelling community and for the settled community. Planning rules should be the same for all.

### Stronger powers for councils to tackle unauthorised development

The Government is concerned about the growing number of unauthorised developments and encampments and the problems they cause within communities. Mr Pickles is looking at ways to strengthen the powers available to councils to more effectively tackle unauthorised development. This will include action against speculative, unscrupulous private developers.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""Unauthorised developments have created tensions between travellers and the settled population. We want to redress the balance and put fairness back into communities.
> 
> ""Like the rest of the population, the majority of travellers are law-abiding citizens and they should have the same chance of having a safe place to live and bring up their children. These changes will put travellers who play by the rules on an equal footing.
> 
> ""But at the same time, we will not sit back and allow people to bypass the planning rules that everyone else has to abide by. That's why we will strengthen the powers that councils have to enforce against breaches of planning rules and tackle the abuse of the planning system.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Government is announcing its intention to commence Section 318 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, designed to extend tenancy rights for travellers in authorised local authority traveller sites.

2. The details of New Homes Bonus scheme will be set out in a public consultation later in the year.

3. The Government intends to revoke Planning Circular 01/06 and Circular 04/07, subject to necessary impact assessments, to be replaced with a light-touch guidance outlining councils' statutory obligations. [www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100726/text/100726w0002.htm#10072632000565](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100726/text/100726w0002.htm#10072632000565) (external link).

4. Further announcements will be made in due course on plans to increase planning enforcement powers; measures will be included in the Localism Bill this autumn.

",29-Aug-10,making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively,,,,eric-pickles,,,,
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1886974,Time for fair play for all on planning,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today announced proposals for a more localist and fairer way of providing sites for travellers, building on earlier commitments to strengthen measures to tackle the abuse of the planning system.

In new proposed planning guidelines, the Green Belt and countryside will have more robust protection, local councils will have more discretion, and local planning authorities will have a stronger hand in supporting appropriate development. Central guidance to councils on compulsorily purchasing land for travellers sites will be removed, and top-down Whitehall planning rules, which Ministers believe were counterproductive, will be abolished.

Ministers believe planning regulations have seriously harmed community relations over the last few years, by imposing targets for traveller sites on local councils, increasing the number of unauthorised sites, and compelling councils to encroach onto the Green Belt. At the same time the old planning rules created a perception of special treatment for some groups, undermining the notion of 'fair play' in the planning system and further harming community cohesion.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Top-down planning diktats led to the worst of both worlds - more unauthorised sites and worsening community relations. It's time for fair play in the planning system - standing up for those who play by the rules, and tougher action for those who abuse and play the system.
> 
> ""We are giving councils the power and discretion to protect the environment and help rebuild community relations. Clearer planning guidelines will make the planning system easier for all to understand.
> 
> ""A small minority may still try to abuse the system. Councils should be particularly vigilant over the extended Royal Wedding and Easter weekends to take firm action against anyone who tries.""

Outlining the support for authorised sites in the Government's new approach, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The majority of travellers are law-abiding citizens and they should be given the same opportunities as everyone else to live in a safe place where they can bring up their children.
> 
> ""The New Homes Bonus and £60 million of site grants will support councils to build and plan new official sites. We will also give law-abiding travellers better protection against eviction and the same rights and responsibilities as residents on other mobile home sites.
> 
> ""We want to ensure a smooth transition to the new system - so the Government will also help provide training opportunities for councillors about their new role.""

The new planning policy will give councils the freedom and responsibility to determine the right level of traveller site provision in their area, in consultation with local communities, while ensuring fairness in the planning system. It sits within a broader package of reforms to abolish the last Government's Regional Strategies and return planning powers to councils and communities.

Ministers believe that local planning authorities are best placed to know the needs of their communities, not unelected regional bodies. In line with other reforms to streamline the planning system, the new Planning Policy Statement will be a much shorter and clearer document that will be easier for councils and also members of the public to use effectively.

Measures to improve the provision of traveller sites include:

  * **Stronger enforcement powers for councils** - strengthened enforcement powers will be made available to councils so they can tackle unauthorised development more effectively, helping to reduce community tensions. This will include action against speculative, unscrupulous private developers. A number of measures are already included in Localism Bill.
  * **Stronger powers for councils to limit the opportunities for retrospective planning applications** - strengthened powers will help councils tackle any form of unauthorised development. Mr Pickles is calling on councils to be vigilant over the upcoming bank holiday weekends - including the extended Royal Wedding and Easter weekends - so there is no abuse of the planning system and retrospective planning applications.
  * **Dale Farm funding** - Ministers have confirmed today that the department will provide up to £1.2m for Basildon Council to clear the unauthorised pitches on the Green Belt at the Dale Farm traveller site, given the exceptional nature of the case.
  * **Stronger rights for residents of authorised council sites** - travellers on official council sites will benefit from changes to legislation that will give them the same protection against eviction as residents on other mobile home sites and other rights and responsibilities. At the same time councils will be able to take swift action against any travellers who flout the terms of their pitch agreements and they will be able to obtain possessions orders with less risk of legal challenge.
  * **New incentives to build authorised sites -** councils will be given incentives through the New Homes Bonus scheme to deliver new housing. This will include authorised traveller site so that councils will get financial benefits for providing sites where they are needed.
  * **Pitch Funding** - the Government is providing £60 million of funding that councils and other registered providers can use to provide new authorised sites for travellers. Councils and other registered providers can apply to the Home and Communities Agency to use the funding.
  * **Training for councillors** - the Government will provide £50,000 to support training for councillors about their leadership role in relation to traveller site provision and planning applications for sites. The funding will support the work of the body, Local Government Improvement and Development.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation published today will consider the details of a proposed new, single Planning Policy Statement that will replace _Circular 01/2006: Planning Gypsy and Traveller Caravan Sites_ and _Circular 04/2007: Planning for Travelling Showpeople_. The consultation will run until 6 July 2011. A copy can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/travellersitesconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/planningandbuilding/travellersitesconsultation).

2. The circulars have become increasingly outdated in the context of broader reforms to the planning system, in particular the move towards more local decision making, shorter and fewer statements of national planning policy and the abolition of Regional Strategies through the Localism Bill.

3. Following an earlier consultation, on 30 April 2011 Section 318 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 will come into force. This will include traveller sites that are provided by local authorities in the Mobile Homes Act 1983. The responses to the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/implementinghomesresponses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/implementinghomesresponses).

4. The Government is providing £60 million of funding that councils and other registered providers can use to provide new authorised sites for travellers. Councils and other registered providers can apply to the Homes and Communities Agency for funding as part of the Affordable Homes Programme. Details of the Affordable Homes Programme can be found at: [www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/affordable-homes](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/affordable-homes) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2078966,"Volunteer push will create 10,000 youth group places for young people","A £10 million cash boost to train thousands of new volunteer leaders for national youth groups like the Scouts, Guiding and Police Cadets will give young people valuable skills and opportunities, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Over the next two and a half years Youth United - a coalition of the major youth volunteering organisations - established by the HRH The Prince of Wales and supported by The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation - will recruit and train up 2,700 new adult volunteers to run 400 new youth groups in communities across the country that will mean over 10,000 more young people will be able to join a pack or troop.

Under the ambitious new programme, Youth United organisations will target funding to kick-start much loved youth and volunteering activities in communities where historically there have been limited opportunities, because the few adults with the right skills and experience have needed the additional support from new volunteers.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Scouts, Guides and the Cadets have a tremendously proud and successful history of giving young people the kind of fun, life skills and experiences they can't get anywhere else.
> 
> ""They rely on the goodwill and dedication of trained adult volunteers to provide this community service, which brings young people of all backgrounds and beliefs together.
> 
> ""Over 1.5 million young people are regularly involved but many more want to join - with more volunteer leaders needed to bring waiting lists down - every young person in the country should have the chance to participate if they want to.
> 
> ""The help we are giving today will mean Youth United groups can train a new generation of local volunteers to run a new cub pack or guiding patrol and make all the difference in fifteen communities that face some significant challenges.""

The areas identified where this money can make the biggest impact are:

  * Birmingham

  * Bradford

  * Knowsley

  * Hackney

  * Haringey

  * Manchester

  * Middlesbrough

  * Newham

  * Redbridge

  * Rochdale

  * Tower Hamlets

Additionally, the four areas which will be targeted as HRH The Prince of Wales's priority areas for helping young people are:

  * Broadwater Farm Estate (Tottenham)
  * Burnley
  * Burslem (Stoke-on-Trent)
  * Redcar (Redcar and Cleveland)

Rod Jarman, the Chair of the Youth United Board, said:

> ""This is a wonderful opportunity for us to make a significant difference in youth provision in a number of areas across England. Through the unique partnership between a government department, a number of the charities of HRH The Prince of Wales and the network of organisations called Youth United we will be able to extend the opportunity for young people to volunteer and join one of our member organisations. We now have a real chance to engage more adults and let them experience and gain from volunteering to help others and to identify new ways of working to provide good accommodation from which the units can work.""

Derek Twine, Chief Executive of the Scout Association said:

> ""We welcome the Government's investment in volunteering, and are pleased that the excellent work taking place in the voluntary sector to support young people and their communities is being recognised and encouraged.""

The Prince of Wales's charities - including The Prince's Trust, which helps unemployed young people into jobs - will be working together to improve the prospects of young people. Last year, more than three in four young people supported by The Prince's Trust moved into work, education or training. The Prince of Wales's charity has helped more than 650,000 young people since 1976 and supports 100 more each day.

Ginny Lunn, director of policy at The Prince's Trust, said:

> ""Growing up without a positive adult role model can have a devastating impact on a young person's self-esteem and future prospects. At The Prince's Trust, we provide young people with role models to help them into work. A little guidance goes a long way, as these young people often inspire the next generation of youngsters to turn their lives around in the same way that they have.""

### Notes to editors

1. Youth United organisations work to co-ordinate and lead action across the coalition of the major youth volunteering organisations which collectively provides volunteer-led volunteering opportunities for 1.5 million young people. The Youth United member organisations are: Air Training Corps, Army Cadets, Boys' Brigade, Fire Cadets, Girlguiding UK, Girls' Brigade, Marine and Sea Cadets, Scouts, St John Ambulance, Volunteer Police Cadets. For more information on Youth United organisations please see [www.youthunited.org.uk](http://www.youthunited.org.uk/) (external link).

2. The funding announced today will 'kick start' 400 new branches. Once established, these new branches are expected to be permanently self-sustaining, raising their own running costs through local fundraising activity and/or subscriptions, giving the programme a substantial and long term legacy.

3. This programme allows Youth United organisations to work with Government, Local Authorities and local volunteers to target those areas in most need, developing monitoring and delivery models that are consistent with their extensive experience of what works best and further support other expansion across the country.

4. The Prince's Trust helps change young lives. It gives practical and financial support, developing key workplace skills such as confidence and motivation. It works with 13-to-30-year-olds who have struggled at school, have been in care, are long-term unemployed or have been in trouble with the law. The Prince of Wales's charity has helped more than 650,000 young people since 1976 and supports 100 more each day. Last year, more than three in four young people supported by The Trust moved into work, education or training. In April 2011, Fairbridge became part of The Prince's Trust. The new united organisation will help 50,000 young people this year.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1730005,Experts join the call to get council spending data online,"Data experts across the country have echoed Eric Pickles' call to get local authorities' spending data online for the public to scrutinise.

Councils have until January publish details of all their spending over £500 in full, and the clock is ticking with just 64 days to get their house in order.

A number of councils are one step ahead with their data online already, but opendata experts are urging them to go one step further, think outside the box and consider how they can make the information more useful for the public.

Martha Lane Fox, UK Digital Champion, said:

> ""I welcome today's announcement that shows the government encouraging councils to publish their data online. Transparency, not just on spending but on all data across government, is essential in allowing people to engage with and challenge government. Today is a good step forward in opening up people's access to information, but data on its own is not enough. I'd like to see the digital community stepping forward to build applications to make that data tangible and useful for the public - and maybe even making something more enterprising out of it!
> 
> ""Councils should also see this as an opportunity to inspire more local people to get online and to show them that the internet can be a useful tool for them - whether that's inspecting their councillor's spend or accessing services and saving money themselves. All councils should sign up to the raceonline2012 campaign and make a pledge to help get everyone in their area online, not just their data.""

Jessica Crowe, Executive Director of the Centre for Public Scrutiny said:

> ""Transparency is a vital element of good governance and can help public bodies be accountable to the people they serve and whose money they spend. We urge local authorities to think creatively not just about the data they publish but how the public can use that information to hold them to account in a meaningful way and lead to better outcomes and value for money. We hope that other arms of government will follow CLG's example in promoting the principle of greater transparency across all public bodies.""

Professor Nigel Shadbolt of Southampton University, Chair of the Local Public Data Panel and a member of the Public Sector Transparency Board:

> ""The publication of all spends by Local Authorities over £500 is hugely important. Authorities spend millions and millions of pounds in our name, so why shouldn't we know how that money is spent?
> 
> ""It will be useful in a whole range of ways. We are going to be able to see what the pattern of spend is, what particular contractors are used and whether it represents value for money. Once it's published councils can have a discourse with the citizen to find out how they want their money to be spent and where they would want to save. This is another important step in the drive for open data and transparency at all levels and across all of Government.""

Chris Taggart, creator of openlylocal.com added:

> ""This is about a conversation with the people. Publishing information - which belongs to the public, after all - allows them to look at local spending and say 'wait a minute, you could be saving money there'.
> 
> ""There are all sorts of benefits to be gained from understanding the data and using the skills of the community to understand it. Councils themselves can benchmark their data and spending against other councils. People can build applications which will allow everyone to ask questions and join the conversation.""

Campbell Robb, Shelter Chief Executive, said:

> ""We welcome this news which we hope will be an important step in increasing transparency in how local authorities' housing budgets are being spent. What is now important is to ensure this is rolled out in a way which ensures consistency across the country.
> 
> ""We hope this announcement will be followed by a similar commitment to publish more detailed information on local housing issues, from rogue landlord convictions to success in tackling homelessness, so that local people can judge more effectively how their council is performing.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2035538,Faith groups and Eric Pickles discuss 'living well together',"On Monday (21 November 2011) Communities Secretary Eric Pickles joined the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks and representatives from nine faith communities for informal discussions on the theme of 'living well together in Britain today'.

The national faith communities' event marks the start of the first working day of Inter Faith Week, a week in which places of worship throw open their doors to other faith communities and people and groups of different backgrounds hold events to highlight their work to promote understanding between people of different faiths and beliefs.![Image: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/20355561.jpg)

Among the 400 community-led celebrations, lectures, exhibitions and school visits that are expected to take place this week are:

  * the official opening of the new Inter-Faith Centre in Ipswich
  * a short season of films with themes of religion or belief, celebrating the 25th anniversary of Leicester Council of Faiths
  * a bread making course in Liverpool where loaves made will be donated to a local soup kitchen and 
  * a multi faith tree planting event of English oaks in a local park in Wakefield.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Inter Faith Week strengthens relations, increases awareness of our different faith communities and is a great opportunity to celebrate the remarkable practical contribution that faith groups make, inspiring great numbers of people to public service. We would be poorer by far without their contribution.
> 
> ""Inter faith activity is thriving as the range of fantastic events taking place up and down the country clearly proves and I'd encourage everyone to get involved this week and in the weeks and months that follow.""

The special inter faith conversation on 'living well together' in Britain today was organised by The Inter Faith Network for the UK.

As well as boosting integration, the grants will spur social action by faith communities, helping to create communities in which people from different backgrounds work together to achieve common aims.

The Faiths in Action programme, managed by the Community Development Foundation (CDF) and sponsored by Communities and Local Government, creates opportunities for dialogue and collaboration between different faith groups within local communities.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Inter faith activity is an important component of the Big Society we want to build, in which people work together for the common good. If we want to live in a truly integrated society, we need opportunities for people from diverse backgrounds to come together - not just to better understand each other but also to work towards shared goals that benefit the whole community.
> 
> ""The Faiths in Action funding supports a great many projects that provide these valuable opportunities and I wish the beneficiaries of this round of funding every success with their endeavours.""

### Social action

Since its launch in 2008, Faiths in Action has awarded funding to a total of 428 projects, engaging youth, women, the elderly and other members of the community in a huge variety of social action and relationship building projects. Diverse as they are, all projects have one overarching aim: to build better understanding among people of different faiths and those of no faith.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1656697,Farming in the city helps Big Society aims,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell took a trip out to Hackney City farm to see how the farm and others like it enable young people who live in built up urban areas to get a taste of farming skills.

The farm - a not for profit social enterprise - is in a very urban area just outside the historic City of London.

In the farm's award winning cafe the Minister met some of Hackney's young residents who have learnt farming skills and an awareness of 'countryside' matters. He also met Hackney City Farm manager Chris Pounds and chief executive of the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens (FCFCG) Jeremy Iles, who explained how the work of the city farm contributes to the Government's 'Big Society' agenda.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Hackney City Farm shows what communities can achieve when they are given the freedom to get involved. It fits well with the Government's Big Society agenda.
> 
> ""I am pleased to see that Hackney City Farm both supports and is supported by its local community. The farm gives 50,000 visitors a year, its volunteers, children and young people, the opportunity to see and take part in activities that are not part of every day urban life - and it's fun too.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is keen to see the continued greening of our urban areas. That is why we have given more powers to local authorities to decide what is right for their area with regard to 'garden grabbing' planning applications.  We are committed to maintaining the Green Belt, Sites of Special Interest and creating a new designation to protect green areas of particular importance to local communities.""

Hackney City Farm Manager Chris Pounds said:

> ""Over the past twenty years we have seen the benefit our city farm brings to the community. From food education to bringing people together, city farms in urban areas around the country are important resources in their communities.  We have been very pleased to show the Minister around our exciting project.""

Nepthali Williams, aged 17, who has been volunteering at the farm for five years said:

> ""Hackney City Farm has helped me build my confidence, not only to work with animals, but to speak to the farm's many visitors. My ambition is to be a farmer or open my own city farm. The farm is very community based. It is about widening people's understanding and that is why it is run; I'm glad to be part of it.""

Jack Coppendale, aged 20, farm volunteer said:

> ""Hackney City Farm has helped me gain experience to further my education and has given me an ambition to become a farmer. I have been here a year now and every day there is something different to do and learn. You gain confidence in working with the public and you can give your knowledge back to the community.""

Kerry Wotton, aged 19, undertaking work experience at the farm said.

> ""The city farm helps the local community, especially young kids, to learn where their food really comes from; to appreciate the work that goes into growing food and rearing animals. It's not just from the supermarket!""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1825222,Final countdown begins to full council transparency,"Councils have been put on a week's notice to get their books open for public scrutiny, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today, 25 January 2011.

Last June, Mr Pickles set a deadline for councils to become more transparent by publishing all of their spending data over £500 online in accessible formats, at the end of January 2011.

Today the Local Government Secretary is starting the final week countdown for councils to show their residents that they are ready to be open and transparent about how they spend taxpayers' money.

Over 210 councils across the country have put some information online, but this leaves almost 150 still to act. A timeline on the Department's website shows who has put their data online while making it crystal clear which councils are leaving it to the eleventh hour.

A draft code of practice will be published shortly to help councils get on track.

Councils are expected to put details of senior pay, councillor expenses, tenders and contracts, meetings, and frontline service data into the open so that 'armchair auditors' can clearly see the decisions being made on their behalf by the council in due course.

The Department for Communities and Local Government has already set the precedent for councils to follow, regularly publishing all spend data over £500.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I've called for every council to become more open and accountable about every aspect of their work, starting with getting all expenditure over £500 online by the end of this month. Transparency can help save money in tough times protecting frontline services, by cutting waste and unnecessary costs.
> 
> ""The final countdown for councils has begun. In the last six months more than half of all councils have got their house in order. Today I'm putting those councils still to open up on one week's notice.
> 
> ""The public have a right to know how their tax pounds are spent, and those yet to deliver are running out of excuses and time before they have to face their electorate - I hope every council chooses to do so openly, transparently and democratically.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1800775,"Final curtain for unitary plans in Suffolk, Norfolk and Devon","Restructuring of councils in Norfolk, Suffolk and Devon that ministers called 'wasteful and unnecessary', will not go ahead now that the Local Government Bill has received Royal Assent.

The Coalition Government introduced an urgent Bill in May to stop plans to create unitary councils in Exeter and Norwich. Ministers said the costs of the reorganisation to the taxpayer, estimated at £40m, could not be justified at a time when the whole country was reducing public spending to tackle a legacy of debt.

Councils are being asked to do more for less as the Government tackles an unsustainable public deficit to ensure economic recovery. Ministers believed the unitary plans would have diverted time and money away from protecting frontline services.

The Local Government Act 2010 brings to an end the present round of local government restructuring in Suffolk, Norfolk and Devon, began by the previous administration, by preventing the implementation of the proposals to create the new unitary councils.

Councils across the country have been given new powers and financial freedoms. The Government is urging them to focus on making efficiencies by sharing back office functions, improving procurement and using transparency to cut waste.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""It was important that this piece of legislation was passed so that taxpayers' money was not wasted on an unnecessary council reorganisation imposed in Exeter and Norwich by the previous Government. The Royal Assent to this Act finally puts a stop to what would have been an expensive and unnecessary distraction.
> 
> ""At a time when every council needs to be focused on frontline services and savings, as we tackle a legacy of public debt, spending £40million on a unitary restructuring would have been reckless and wasteful. Councils in Norfolk, Devon and Suffolk can now get on with the crucial business of using their new freedoms and flexibilities to protect frontline services.""

The independent Boundary Committee recommended last December that the unitary plans for Exeter and Norwich should not be implemented. There were concerns about affordability, the risk of fragmenting local services, and the lack of widespread local support.

Councils in Suffolk had also been asked to establish a county constitutional convention to reach a consensus on a unitary structure for Suffolk.

### Notes to editors

  1. The October 2006 Local Government White Paper invited councils to submit proposals for unitary restructuring. In January 2007, Exeter and Norwich City Councils and Ipswich Borough Council submitted proposals. The then ministers judged that these did not meet the full criteria, and in 2008 asked the Boundary Committee to look at alternative proposals for the whole or part of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk.
  2. The Boundary Committee provided their advice in December last year recommending a single unitary council for Devon, a single unitary council for Norfolk, and made two proposals in Suffolk - a single unitary council for Suffolk (the Committee's preferred option) or a two-unitary pattern comprising an Ipswich and Felixstowe authority and a Rural Suffolk authority. This was followed by a six week period of representations about the advice and the original proposals from the city and borough councils.
  3. The then ministers received over 2,700 representations and had meetings with many of the councils concerned and MPs for the areas. They concluded that the Boundary Committee's recommendations for Norfolk and Devon did not have the support of any of the areas' principal councils and they decided to take no action on the Committee's proposals for those councils. Whilst acknowledging that the original proposals for Exeter and Norwich did not meet all the criteria, the then ministers decided nevertheless to go ahead with them and create unitary councils for those cities from 1 April 2011.
  4. This decision was challenged and overturned in Judicial Review proceedings by Devon and Norfolk county councils in July 2010. The Act brings final certainty.
  5. In Suffolk, the then ministers concluded that none of the proposals commanded support from all the Councils, and the previous Government proposed a County Constitutional Convention comprising the principal local authorities in Suffolk and their MPs to reach a consensus on a possible unitary solution.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1830723,Final local government settlement a fair deal for communities,"Final arrangements for a fair and progressive funding settlement for councils that protect front-line services and shield the most vulnerable have been published by Local Government Minister Bob Neill.

Councils will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and the grant has been adjusted so none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall.

This settlement reflects the desire to support areas with the most need and the urgent obligation to bring the country's public finances back in order, keep interest rates down and prevent the national debt escalating beyond £1.4 trillion of taxpayers' money.

Ministers have consulted widely with the Local Government Association, London Councils and many individual local authorities, listening to concerns raised. Having considered all views, Ministers have today confirmed the proposals for the distribution of formula grant for 2011-12 as announced in December.

Mr Neill said:

> ""We urgently need to reduce the country's public spending and local government accounts for around a quarter of all public expenditure so councils have a big part to play.
> 
> ""We have listened to views and looked hard at the figures and have pushed more money to those most dependent on grant so now no council will face a reduction of more than 8.8 per cent and shire districts will get £10 million to compensate for the loss of concessionary bus travel funding.
> 
> ""These extra steps once again show we have worked to deliver a fair and progressive approach that directs grant to where it is most needed - the vulnerable and needy - whilst protecting taxpayers.""

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles added:

> ""This goes hand in hand with the new localism powers and spending freedoms we are handing councils so they can be as efficient and effective as possible with public funds, rooting out waste and focusing on frontline public services.""

The final settlement:

  * allocates a total Government Revenue Grant of £72.7 billion to Local Authorities in 2011-12
  * distributes £29.4 billion in formula grant in 2011-12 and £27.1 billion for 2012-13
  * keeps the average revenue spending power reduction for 2011-12 at only 4.4 per cent and reduces the upper limit from 8.9 per cent to 8.8 per cent
  * increases Transitional Grant to £96 million in 2011-12 and £21 million in 2012-13
  * makes a further £10 million available through Formula Grant to compensate Shire Districts for the loss of concessionary travel funding in 2011-12
  * ensures a fair distribution between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire
  * creates four new grant bands or 'floors' with different limits that protect those most dependent on grant against potentially steeper reductions

The Coalition Government remains committed to protecting local taxpayers. A growing number of councils have already indicated that they will be taking up the Government offer to fund a council tax freeze in April through its £650 million fund. Authorities who do not increase their council tax are eligible for a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1816095,Fire and rescue service control room services in England,"The Government has published a consultation on the future of fire and rescue control services in England. This follows the closure of the FiReControl project, announced on 20 December 2010.

Local fire and rescue authorities have a statutory duty to answer emergency calls and mobilise resources. They have continued to fulfil this duty, and be funded to do so, during the lifetime of the project and, consequently, the closure of the project poses no risk to public safety.

Fire Minister Bob Neill MP said:

> ""This Government believes that the fire and rescue community is best placed to decide the future of their control services. No solution will be imposed. The consultation reviews the legacy assets from the project, as well as lessons learnt, and encourages the sector to make best use of these in their future plans, for the benefit of both the taxpayer and local communities.""

The consultation discusses whether the original aims of the project - improving efficiency, national resilience and the technology available to fire and rescue services - are still valid and, if so, how they might be achieved now. It also considers the principles on which available funding should be distributed. The role of central government, if any, is also considered.

A copy of the consultation document is available here [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices). Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Responses are requested by 8 April 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1804631,"Fire Futures, an independent review of the fire and rescue service in England","An independent review into the fire and rescue service in England that looks into its role, efficiency, accountability and work with other emergency services has today been published.

The review, which does not represent Government policy, has drawn in ideas from across the sector. Its publication marks the end of the first stage in a process which will shape the service's future shape and direction.

Fire Futures, four sector led reports, put forward a range of ideas on how the fire and rescue sector can work together to address current and future challenges and presents new models and wide-ranging options for delivering fire and rescue services. Each of the separate options will be considered against the Government's commitment to localism, decentralisation, and transparency, while also delivering value for money.

The Government will report back formally by March 2011. However, Ministers are indicating today that they do not wish to take forward more controversial proposals on (a) a new levy on home insurance and motor insurance policies, (b) charging for road traffic accidents and (c) charging higher council tax for fire services in urban areas. These proposals do not reflect the views of Ministers.

The Fire Futures reports are:

  * _Role of the Fire and Rescue Service_ - this looks at the additional powers and responsibilities required to overcome barriers faced by the fire and rescue service in delivering service and options for closer working with other emergency services.
  * _Efficiency, Effectiveness and Productivity_ - looks at ways to improve operational efficiency, purchasing and procurement.
  * _Localism and Accountability_ - outlines a series of proposals to extend localism, transparency and accountability by offering communities a greater role in determining and monitoring local services.
  * _National Interests_ - looks at the respective roles of the fire and rescue service and government in national resilience, the built environment, improved knowledge management and decentralisation.

Some of the options for consideration coming from the reports include:

  * seeking a power of general competence - taking power away from the centre and placing it locally;
  * a less prescriptive National Framework setting out national and local roles and the rights and expectations communities should have of the fire and rescue service; and
  * exploring scope for closer working between fire and ambulance services.

The Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""I thank the review's members for their independent report and their contribution to an ongoing debate. This is not a blueprint for the fire and rescue service, but the beginning of an ongoing dialogue. There are some suggestions that the Government does not wish to pursue - such as a new insurance levy or higher council tax.
> 
> ""The fire sector does need to lead change so that it can continue to provide the excellent service communities have come to expect. But government also has a role to play, handing freedoms back to fire authorities. We have already listened and started with proposals in the Localism Bill freeing fire and rescue authorities from constantly needing government approval, and make greater use of their assets and capacity to support the Big Society. ""

### Notes to editors

  1. The chairs of the Fire Futures Workstreams presented their independent reports to Bob Neill at a roundtable discussion on Wednesday 15 December 2010. The Fire Futures reports are available on the Department's website: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/fire/firerescueservice/firefutures/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/fire/firerescueservice/firefutures/).
  2. In July 2010, Fire Minister Bob Neill invited partners to set the terms of the review and to develop wide ranging options with the power to shape the future structure and direction of the fire and rescue service. The sector has been firmly in the lead with DCLG in support and over a hundred partner bodies and volunteers have contributed to these reports. The Government will consider the recommendations and report back formally by March 2011.
  3. Partners are encouraged to give their reactions to the report by emailing the Fire Futures email account at [FireFutures@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:firefutures@communities.gsi.gov.uk).
  4. The workstream on the role of the Fire and Rescue Service (Delivery Models) was led by Cllr David Milsted, Dorset Fire and Rescue Authority; the workstream on Efficiency, Effectiveness and Productivity was led by Chief Fire Officer Max Hood, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service; the workstream on Localism and Accountability was led by Cllr Andre Gonzalez De Savage, Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Authority; and Brian Robinson, Association for Specialist Fire Protection led the workstream on National Interests.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1885271,Fire Futures: Government publishes its response to the independent review of the fire and rescue service in England,"Fire Minister Bob Neill today set out how local decision making and restoring a focus on local communities will be at the heart of Fire and Rescue Service policy as the Government published its response to the sector's Fire Futures Reports.

The Fire Futures Review, at the invitation of central Government, gave those working within the fire and rescue sector an exceptional opportunity to identify ideas for their future. This resulted in four independent reports published in December 2010. They looked into the role, efficiency and accountability of the Fire and Rescue Service in England.

The Government's response, published today, provides a clear statement of the principles that are central to the future of the delivery of fire and rescue services. The response document outlines that Government is responsible for enabling and empowering the service and for ensuring appropriate funding to deliver reform, and in particular expresses the Government's view that:

  * Decisions on local service delivery are best made locally, not top down from Whitehall
  * Local fire and rescue services are accountable to local people with local responsibility for decisions and performance. National targets and monitoring are a thing of the past, the focus is on serving local communities
  * Clarity on the national and local roles in resilience arrangements will be provided within the next statutory National Framework

The Fire Futures reports also provide an 'ideas bank' and for many of these ideas the next steps will be for the sector to determine and take forward as appropriate.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""From the start of the Fire Futures Review I was clear that I wanted this to be led by the fire and rescue services themselves, providing the sector for the first time with a real opportunity to identify ideas for the future direction of fire and rescue.
> 
> ""I am extremely grateful to those who contributed: members of Fire and Rescue Authorities, frontline firefighters, control room and other staff, professional representatives and the wider industry, for their time and expertise to undertake this important review.
> 
> ""Ending the culture of top-down Whitehall management of the fire and rescue service and restoring a focus on communities and local accountability rather than targets is at the heart of the Government's approach. The 'ideas bank' offers the sector the freedom to determine whether these ideas fit local needs without micro-management by the Government.
> 
> ""We will work with the sector to develop a new National Framework, and will re-set the relationship between fire and rescue authorities and central government. We  will help 'barrier bust' where fire and rescue authorities find unnecessary restrictions are stopping them from getting on with things that clearly make sense.
> 
> ""The Government's focus in the future will be on providing the right framework for national resilience and to enable local Fire and Rescue Authorities and the wider sector to deliver the reform agenda and increased accountability to local communities for the delivery of their services.""

The Government will shortly begin to develop and consult with the sector on a new National Framework to be in place for 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1924846,Fire Kills campaign appoints fire safety champion for landlords,"Councillor Mark Healey, Chair of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Authority, has joined the Fire Kills campaign as a champion for fire safety in rented homes, encouraging landlords to make their properties as safe as possible for their tenants.

Fire Minister, Bob Neill, announced Cllr Healey's new role as champion for fire safety in the rented sector in a short video-announcement at the Housing Sector National Forum today. 

Since its beginnings in 1988, the Fire Kills campaign has seen the number of yearly fire related deaths and casualties reduce dramatically, and ownership of smoke alarms has increased from just nine percent in 1987 to 86 percent last year.

But despite this rise in ownership, evidence suggests that those renting properties without an alarm are often among those most vulnerable to the risk of fire such as older people or single parent families. 

As an advocate for the Fire Kills campaign, Cllr Mark Healey will remind private landlords that it is good practice to install and maintain smoke alarms in the properties they are renting out. He will also encourage them to help protect their tenants and their property from the devastating effects of fire by fitting long-life smoke alarms like 10-year battery devices or hard-wired systems in every home they rent out.

Bob Neill said:

> ""A working smoke alarm can provide the vital seconds needed to escape a house fire, so installing and maintaining an alarm is one of the most important things a landlord can do to protect their tenants and their property from the devastating effects of fire.
> 
> ""I am delighted that Cllr Mark Healey has agreed to join the Fire Kills campaign as an advocate for private landlords.
> 
> ""A landlord himself, Mark will, I believe, be a strong and compelling voice on behalf of the campaign, encouraging landlords to install and maintain smoke alarms in their properties.""

Cllr Mark Healey said:

> ""As Chair of the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Authority, I am determined to do all I can to reduce the numbers of accidental fire deaths and injuries.
> 
> ""Most fire deaths are preventable, and can be avoided if householders alter their behaviour and think more about fire safety as an important issue that could affect them and their families.
> 
> ""As a landlord myself, I know how important it is to install working smoke alarms in the properties I am responsible for. I am therefore pleased to have been asked to help support the Government's Fire Kills campaign and urge all landlords to consider installing either 10-year battery alarms or hard-wired detectors in their properties.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1779734,Fire Kills campaign calls on Big Society to join the fire safety movement,"The award-winning Fire Kills campaign will be back on the airwaves this weekend. The relaunch of the radio adverts hails the beginning of a new approach for the campaign with an increased focus on partnership and the Big Society.

Nine out of ten households across the country now own a smoke alarm according to the most recent English Housing Survey - up from 74 per cent in 2001. However it's important to remember that ownership is nothing without regular maintenance. One in four of these alarms is likely to fail in a house fire because it is clogged, broken, or most often because the battery is flat or has been removed.

With that in mind, this weekend will see the return of a targeted 'Don't drown in toxic smoke' radio campaign. Timed to play at weekends when people are more likely to tackle household tasks, the ads will play on local radio stations to remind the public to check their smoke alarm.

Fire Kills is also calling on the Big Society to fly the flag for fire safety, asking communities, authorities, businesses, and the fire safety industry itself to find new and innovative ways of spreading the message. All smoke alarm manufacturers in England already promote the Fire Kills message on their products and we're asking the industry to go even further.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Every death through accidental house fire is a tragedy that could be easily avoided in the modern world. Checking your smoke alarm is a simple, lifesaving step, and it's a simple message to pass on. I urge everyone to get involved with the Fire Kills campaign and help spread the word.""

Government's Chief Fire & Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Even with nine out of ten of England's households owning a smoke alarm it's still vital to check it works. Just two to three breaths of toxic smoke could render you unconscious, and you have less than two minutes to escape a fire before you can't breathe.
> 
> ""The Big Society will have a huge role to play in spreading the fire safety message alongside the Fire Kills adverts. Everyone from individuals to big business has the potential for innovative new ideas to reinforce the work of the Fire and Rescue Service and advertising, helping to transform the Fire Kills campaign into a national movement.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2097884,Fire Minister announces funding for successful control centre projects,"Fire Minister Bob Neill has today announced funding of £74 million to support a range of locally-led projects to improve the resilience and efficiency of local fire and rescue control rooms across England.

This follows on from the termination by the Coalition Government of the last Government's FireControl project, which sought to regionalise fire control rooms across England.

Fire Minister, Bob Neill MP, said:

> ""The Coalition Government is adopting a more localist approach to help secure improvements in national resilience, rather than trying to impose a forced regionalisation of the fire service. These locally-led bids show we can strengthen national resilience and adopt new technology to save lives, without top-down Whitehall micro-management.""

The Chief Fire Officers Association said:

> ""The Chief Fire Officers Association National Resilience has developed a detailed peer support process designed to provide assistance and support to fire authorities with the implementation of their control room improvement plans.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1803629,Fire Minister Bob Neill calls time on FiReControl,"Fire Minister Bob Neill MP today reached agreement with the main FiReControl contractor, Cassidian (formerly EADS Defence and Security), to call a halt to the troubled project. The Minister made it clear in the summer that Cassidian must deliver the main IT system to time, cost and quality. The Department and the contractor have now jointly concluded that the project requirements cannot be delivered to an acceptable timeframe.

Ministers believe that the interests of both the fire and rescue community and the taxpayer are now best served by closing down the project.

FiReControl is the third part of the last Government's Fire and Resilience Programme - the other two, Firelink and New Dimension, have been delivered. The project aimed to replace England's 46 standalone fire and rescue control rooms with a national network of nine control centres.

In a Written Ministerial Statement to Parliament today Bob Neill said:

> ""The progress of the project has caused serious concern, and so in June this year I made it clear to the main FiReControl contractor, Cassidian (formerly EADS Defence and Security), that the main IT system must now be delivered to time, cost and quality. At this point, we activated a key milestone in their contract requiring the main IT system to be completed in three control centres by mid-2011.
> 
> We told Cassidian that no additional taxpayers' money could be invested in this project, nor would delivery of a system of reduced quality or functionality be acceptable.
> 
> Following extensive discussion with Cassidian, we have jointly concluded, with regret, that the requirements of the project cannot be delivered to an acceptable timeframe. Therefore the best outcome for the taxpayer and the fire and rescue community is for the contract to be terminated with immediate effect. Cassidian and the Department for Communities and Local Government have reached an acceptable settlement over this although the details will remain commercially confidential.""

The Minister thanked the many operational experts and other representatives from the fire and rescue community for their contribution to the project. Today's decision gives more operational certainty to the Fire and Rescue Service as well as financial certainty to the taxpayer.

The Department will now consult with the fire and rescue community on the future of control room services in England. This will be based on the principles of localism and seek feedback on the best use of FiReControl assets.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1774509,Fire Minister Bob Neill responds to claims the government plans to scrap sprinkler requirements for industrial buildings,"Sir,

Suggestions that the Government is putting fire safety at risk in tall buildings (Fire threat to high-rise blocks, 18 November) by potentially removing provisions for sprinklers are factually wrong.

Homes, commercial and industrial buildings over 30 metres high are already covered by national building regulations that effectively require sprinklers to be installed and we are not changing these measures. The Government's position is very clear: sprinklers continue to play an important role in protecting people from fire.

However, as part of a broader deregulation initiative, we are removing duplicate and unnecessary provisions from primary legislation and an assorted collection of Local Acts to allow individuals, councils and business to get on with their job without unnecessary Government meddling - but never where it puts lives at risk.

Yours faithfully  
Bob Neill

Along with hearing how the Service is helping prevent home fires by visiting peoples' homes and identifying risks, Mr Neill heard how firefighters routinely visit arson ""hotspots"" and working with the local council report items, such as dumped rubbish or broken street lighting, that can promote arson.

During the visit the Minister watched one of the regular exercises the firefighters practice in the station's yard that simulate a domestic fire.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1985456,Firefighter pension reform consultation begins,"A statutory consultation on proposed changes to contribution rates made by firefighters towards their pensions was published today by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

The consultation document sets out proposals for increased employee contributions to the two firefighter pension schemes for the financial year 2012-13.

The consultation proposes that the lowest earning firefighters will see the lowest increases while higher earners, such as chief fire officers, would pay a higher contribution. Members of the New Firefighters Pension Scheme, which has more balanced contributions, will see lower contribution increases.

The Government has already announced that the pension pots that firefighters have already accrued will be protected. This will not change. When firefighters take their pension built up in their final salary schemes it will be based on their final salary at the time of retirement, meanwhile firefighters will have the opportunity to build up their pensions under the reformed schemes for the remainder of their service.

The Government asked Lord Hutton of Furness to review all public sector pensions and to make recommendations on pension arrangements that are sustainable and affordable in the long term, fair to both the public service workforce and the taxpayer and consistent with the fiscal challenges ahead. In his interim report, Lord Hutton reported that people are living much longer and the cost of public sector pensions has risen by a third over the past ten years to £32billion. As Lord Hutton said in his report, ""these costs have generally fallen to the taxpayer"".

The Government believes that reform is therefore necessary to ensure all public service pension schemes remain fair, affordable and sustainable for current and future generations of public sector workers.

Following Lord Hutton's interim report, the Government set out at the Spending Review 2010 its intention to secure £2.8billion savings per year by 2014-15, by increasing employee contributions in public service pension schemes by an average of 3.2 per cent, to be phased in from April 2012. For the firefighters' pension schemes, this means delivering savings of £33million per year by 2014-15.

Today's proposals represent around 40 per cent of the total savings required by 2014-15. Discussions with trade unions and employer representatives on how to deliver the remaining savings, and the wider Hutton reforms, remain ongoing.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Firefighters perform an incredibly important job as the events last month illustrated so powerfully. That's why we want to make sure their pensions remain among the very best available with a guaranteed pension level for all employees - something very few private sector jobs now offer.
> 
> ""However, Lord Hutton's report was absolutely clear that with people living longer, public sector pensions need to have a fairer balance between what employees and taxpayers contribute.
> 
> ""The proposals set out today will start to deliver that rebalancing. A typical firefighter in the 2006 Scheme would only pay £11 more a month as a result of our proposals.
> 
> ""I can reassure firefighters that the pension pots they have already built up will be protected.""

### Notes to editors

1. The proposals set out today will deliver around £13.2million of savings from the Firefighters' Pension Scheme and New Firefighters' Pension Scheme in 2012-13. The consultation document can be found on the Department for Communities and Local Government website: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/firefighterpensioncontributions](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/firefighterpensioncontributions).

2. The consultation applies only to Fire and Rescue Authorities in England and closes on 2 December 2011.

3. The proposed changes only affect employee contribution rates in 2012-13. Tables setting out the proposed contribution rates can be found in the consultation document.

4. There are two separate Firefighter pension schemes. They are the Firefighters' Pension Scheme (1992) and the New Firefighters' Pension Scheme (2006).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1879474,"First communities to use powers to bring growth, jobs and homes to their neighbourhoods","The first communities to test radical new rights to give local people much greater ability to shape development in their area have been announced today by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

Seventeen communities - a mix of cities, urban and rural areas - will spearhead a trial of neighbourhood planning, a powerful new right being introduced in the Localism Bill.

Neighbourhood planning is a key reform designed to create the conditions for communities to welcome growth by giving local people a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area; from determining the locations of shops, offices and schools to setting standards of design for new housing.

Local people will for the first time be able to decide the types of development given automatic planning permission through a Neighbourhood Development Order. If approved by a local referendum, a council will need to adopt a neighbourhood plan providing it is line with wider ambitions for growth in their area.

Neighbourhood planning complements reforms announced in the Budget to ensure the planning system does everything possible to support economic growth and sustainable development. These measures include allowing communities to share directly in the benefits of growth through the New Homes Bonus.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Planning has increasingly become one of the most contentious issues in Britain, with communities becoming pitted against development. Often the reason is that local people feel alienated from the planning process, with no influence over changes to their area.
> 
> ""Neighbourhood planning will help to reverse that position by giving communities the ability to shape development in their area rather than being dictated to.
> 
> ""Localism and growth will go hand in hand. By giving local people a greater say together with new incentives to share in the benefits of growth, our reforms will help to create the conditions where communities begin to welcome development rather than resist it at all costs.""

The 17 neighbourhood planning front-runners will be led by Local Authorities who will work with community groups and parish councils to prepare draft plans and Neighbourhood Development Orders.

They include:

  * The London Borough of Southwark which will work with the community to develop two Neighbourhood Plans in adjoining Bankside and Bermondsey that will provide more homes, improve housing conditions and bring more employment. The community is eager to ensure new development meets their needs.
  * Blaby District Council in Leicestershire which will work with the Blaby South Community Forum, an active local group eager to support growth to improve local infrastructure. They are keen to allow development of a retirement village.
  * West Dorset District Council which will work with Cerne Abbas Parish. This village of around 750 people is eager to bring new housing to the area and to consider redeveloping their primary school site to help fund a new school.

Each of the 17 areas will receive £20,000 towards developing their plan from a £1m fund set up to help communities eager to trial neighbourhood planning

A further 33 grants of £20,000 will also be awarded from the fund to projects that applied to be front runners. This is to help them carry forward their plans on their own.

### Notes to editors

  1. The Neighbourhood Planning Front Runners will prepare planning documents in close collaboration with community groups and parish councils. These documents will be prepared under the current legal and policy framework ahead of the new provisions for Neighbourhood Planning that will be introduced through the Localism Bill. Neighbourhood Planning will be a radical new right being introduced in the Localism Bill. A plain English guide to the Bill can be found at [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localismplainenglishguide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localismplainenglishguide).
  2. When the provisions of the Localism Bill are enacted, Neighbourhood Plans will give communities a much greater say on what gets built, but must be in line with wider ambitions for growth in the council's development plan.
  3. Local people will be able to define types of development which will have automatic planning permission. This is known as a Neighbourhood Development Order.
  4. If approved by a local referendum, the Neighbourhood Plan will need to be adopted by the council.
  5. The 17 Front Runners involve Local Planning Authorities for:
  * Birmingham City Council - Balsall Heath (Birmingham)
  * Bristol City Council - Lockleaze (Bristol)
  * London Borough of Southwark - Bermondsey
  * London Borough of Sutton - Hackbridge
  * North Tyneside Council - North Shields Fish Quay
  * Wirral Borough Council - Devonshire Park
  * Allerdale Borough Council - Cockermouth
  * Blaby District Council - Blaby
  * Cherwell Borough Council - Banbury
  * Exmoor National Park Authority - Lynton
  * Gedling Borough Council - Newstead
  * Lewes District Council - Ringmer
  * Northumberland County - Allendale
  * Shropshire Council - Much Wenlock
  * Teignbridge District Council - Dawlish
  * West Dorset District Council - Cerne Abbas
  * Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead - Bray

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1872175,First 4 new generation enterprise zone locations identified,"Four vanguard areas - Nottingham, Liverpool, Manchester and London - that will deliver new economic growth through the next generation of Enterprise Zones are hailed by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Business Secretary Vince Cable today for naming where they will locate their sites.

The ministers are also announcing the launch of a scheme to identify where the remaining ten Enterprise Zones will be created as Government continues to take action to back enterprise, plan for growth and share prosperity across the country.

The announcement comes as the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister visited the new Nottingham Enterprise Zone at the Boots campus in Nottingham to hear the local enterprise partnership's proposals to boost the local economy.

The Budget announced that the Government would create 21 new Enterprise Zones, within local enterprise partnerships, with simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses, would be established in local enterprise partnerships across England. The areas will have real potential to create new businesses and jobs with wider economic benefits.

Budget also confirmed that the first vanguard Enterprise Zones would be based within eleven local enterprise partnerships lead by Birmingham and Solihull, Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, the Bristol area, the Black Country, Derby and Nottingham, Teesside and the North East.

Today the first four areas are able to confirm the exact location of their new zones as Boots campus in Nottingham, Liverpool Waters, Manchester Airport and the Mayor has said London's Zone would be in the Royal Docks.

The Government has asked Local Enterprise Partnerships to nominate the site of Enterprise Zones based on the economic rationale and potential for growth - as business lead partnerships with local authorities they are ideally placed to identify the sites that offer the best opportunity for growth.

The focus of the vanguard Enterprise Zones is on cities and those areas that have missed out in the last ten years. But other areas have potential for growth too so today Government is also launching a competition to identify a further 10 Enterprise Zones in England by July.

Mr Pickles and Mr Vince Cable have written to all local enterprise partnerships with more information on Enterprise Zones.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Growth is this Government's number one priority and a new generation of Enterprise Zones are central to our strategy. Local enterprise partnerships can use these zones as a springboard for private sector growth and wider regeneration. It's great news that the locations for Enterprise Zones can be announced in London, Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham today.

> ""Enterprise Zones are unashamedly pro-growth, with lower taxes and reduced regulations to attract business, but they are also unashamedly localist keeping power and profits within the local area so communities benefit.""

Business Secretary Vince Cable added:

> ""Enterprise Zones will create the environment for businesses to thrive and stimulate growth in the places that have the most potential.
> 
> ""The 21 areas we are creating across England will give businesses simpler planning rules, access to super-fast broadband and more generous treatment in respect to business rates and capital allowances.
> 
> ""On top of that, the benefits of growth within Enterprise Zones will be kept within their communities, helping to drive the creation of more new jobs and successful enterprises.
> 
> ""We will work closely with local enterprise partnerships to identify new ways we can support them on developing the Zones, especially on issues like enhanced capital allowances and securing inward investment.""

### Notes to editors

1. Budget announced that eleven local enterprise partnerships will be invited to come forward with proposals for enterprise zones. They are: Liverpool City Region; Black Country; Nottingham, Nottinghamshire Derby and Derbyshire; Western England (includes Bristol); London; Greater Manchester; Leeds City Region; Sheffield City Region; North Eastern; Greater Birmingham and Solihull; Tees Valley.

2. The new Enterprise Zones reflect the Government's core belief that economic growth and job creation should be led by the private sector. The Zones will be focused on removing barriers to private sector growth with lower tax levels for business and a reduced planning regime and a lighter regulatory and administrative burden.

All Enterprise Zones will benefit from:

  * a business rate discount worth up to £275,000 per eligible business over a five year period

  * all business rates growth within the zone for a period of at least 25 years will be shared and retained by the local area, to support the Partnership's economic priorities and ensure that Enterprise Zone growth is reinvested locally

  * government help to develop radically simplified planning approaches for the zone using, for example, existing local powers to grant automatic planning permission

  * Government support to ensure that superfast broadband is rolled out throughout the zone, achieved through guaranteeing the most supportive regulatory environment and, if necessary, public funding.

Government will work with Local Enterprise Partnerships on additional options, to suit local circumstances, including consideration of:

  * enhanced capital allowances (instead of business rate discounts) for plant and machinery, in a limited number of cases, where there is a strong focus on manufacturing
  * Tax Increment Finance to support the long term viability of the area
  * UKTI support for inward investment or trade opportunities in the zone.

3. A prospectus which gives more information to local enterprise partnerships, local authorities and partners about the Government's Enterprise Zone programme has been published today at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/enterprisezone](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/enterprisezone).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1960942,First public property map - councils could save billions,"A 'demo' map published today locates over 180,000 assets owned by almost 600 public sector bodies, including Central Government and 87 councils. It reveals widespread public property ownership, beyond frontline services, underlining the scope for savings and the potential of a national asset map.

![Public Assets Map](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1960927.jpg)Public Sector Assets in England  
- [Demo map](http://bit.ly/publicassets) (external link)

Public sector assets are worth an estimated £385bn, with almost two thirds owned by councils. The Government today committed to work with areas seeking to make savings through better property management. Government estimates this could potentially save £35 billion over 10 years.

Mr Pickles wants public sector organisations, including councils, to publish registers of all buildings and land owned. Local people could use the lists alongside the Localism Bill's new community rights to protect local treasures.

Mr Pickles believes the public have a right to see the sheer scale and variety of public sector asset wealth, which in some cases include pubs, farms and even sports clubs. The map reveals:

  * just over 18,000 of Central Government assets - land and buildings;
  * Hampshire County Council owns around 2000 hectares of farm land and property leased to private tenants;
  * over 130 cafes and restaurants, more than 100 pubs, around 60 theatres, over forty hotels including three Holiday Inns, about 20 cinemas and one airport in Southend are listed; as well as
  * nearly 100 golf courses, almost 30 sports stadiums including Swindon Rugby Club, Swindon Town Football club and Aldershot Football Club, a handful of horse riding centres, and one sailing club.

Results from eleven council led pilot projects, known as capital and assets pathfinders, found that on average twenty per cent savings could be made by rationalising public assets or co-locating local services based on customer needs.

And a recent independent report found local government and the public sector could save up to £7bn a year in operational costs through better property management. Annual running costs top £25bn and the backlog of maintenance repairs has been estimated to be around £40bn.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We need to know, now more than ever, exactly what assets are publicly owned. The general public probably have no idea of the sheer scale and scope of property and land on the public sector's books. In many cases it goes way beyond traditional frontline services.
> 
> ""I want the public sector to take a good hard look at what they own. By cataloguing each and every asset councils can help Government find innovative new ways to utilise them, improve local services, keep council running costs down and save taxpayers' money.
> 
> ""This asset information also holds huge potential for local communities, offering an at a glance way to find that new meeting place or rescue the derelict tennis court round the corner.""

The Department has today published the results of the capital and asset pathfinder experience - where councils and Whitehall worked together to make better use of assets. They show savings could be made whilst improving provision of frontline services through measures like co-location.

  * Leicestershire councils and local public services are investigating ways to join up services and better co-ordinate asset use, with hubs being created in three of the districts, to provide cost and carbon emission reductions across the county;
  * Worcestershire Council discovered they were using 39 separate public buildings for public sector training and conferences. They are now looking at how to rationalise these to ensure better use;
  * Cambridgeshire are moving towards a single public sector approach where assets are managed locally to make savings and reduce carbon emissions. Early investigations suggest savings of up to £200million over 10 years may be possible;
  * Hampshire expects to reduce operating size and costs by a least a third in Winchester and Basingstoke by developing a single asset decision making hub across the local public sector. It will be overseen by a Joint Management Board of partners.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham said the findings made clear that central government had a role to play too. Where savings could be made by bringing multiple services under one roof, one of the biggest barriers was lack of engagement from the Whitehall departments which owned the properties concerned.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""We have worked hard with the Pathfinder authorities to develop the concept of asset management. We are very grateful to all who have given their time and enthusiasm to this project. The Local Government Group will now take over from our Department to help promote and extend the work that has been done and continue supporting local areas as they identify savings""

Under the Community Right to Buy, local groups will have a legal right to nominate any vital community asset - including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres - to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. The asset could then be listed for five years. In that time, the owner of a listed asset will have to tell the council if they intend to sell, which will trigger a window of opportunity or 'community countdown', giving people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to make a credible bid before it goes on the open market.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1753574,First wave of local enterprise partnerships as government green lights local growth,"![Image: Map of Local Enterprise Partnerships, wave 1](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1753360.jpg)Local councils and local business will take charge of the local economy as the first 24 local enterprise partnerships have been given the go-ahead, by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and Business Secretary Vince Cable, to drive growth and create jobs.

In a landmark move the first successful partnerships will see business and councils deliver a new local dynamism that will encourage economic growth and protect business (see link to map, top right).

The Government is determined to rebalance the economy and promote sustainable economic growth fairly across the country, and away from the arbitrary regional boundaries that were used previously. Local Enterprise Partnerships will mean that the people who know their area best will be calling the shots.

New proposals were also unveiled for councils to keep the business rates they collect locally, giving councils a renewed incentive to grow their economy and attract business to the area.

In a third measure Ministers declared today the £1.4bn Regional Growth Fund open for business. The fund will particularly support communities currently dependent on the public sector, helping them make the transition to private sector led growth and prosperity.

> ""Our vision for local enterprise partnerships will help transform the economic geography of the country by creating a new local dynamism that will encourage economic growth and protect business with proper local accountability.""

Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""Over the last decade, the country's economy became skewed by artificial boundaries and top-down prescription that did not work. We want to create a fairer and more balanced economy driven by private sector strength, and our plan for local growth will create local enterprise partnerships, reform the planning system and introduce development incentives for local authorities, like allowing them to keep their business rates, so all parts of the country benefit.
> 
> ""I am delighted that we can announce today the first 24 local enterprise partnerships to be given the go ahead. Our vision for local enterprise partnerships will help transform the economic geography of the country by creating a new local dynamism that will encourage economic growth and protect business with proper local accountability.""

Speaking to the Local Government Association today, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark added:

> ""The partnerships going ahead today are a testament to local ambition and ingenuity, and proof that central government does not to micromanage. The potential for Local Enterprise Partnerships is unlimited and any area can come forward with proposals if they suit business and community aspirations.""

The radical proposals to look at ways for Local Authorities to keep the business rates they collect locally would reduce central redistribution. However, the Government is clear any change must be to encourage growth and not lead to an increased tax burden on business.

Under the current system over £20bn of business rates collected by councils are pooled by central government and redistributed across all local authorities. The result is that councils have a vital role supporting the local economy but the cash return for doing so is limited. The plans to localise the business rates would introduce genuine incentives for local economic growth.

By giving councils the ability to retain the money they raise in business rates, councils will have a more direct stake in the future of their own economies and access to funding to deliver the services their communities need.

Eric Pickles added:

> ""We want every community to be open for business and every community to share in the benefits of economic growth. We intend to radically change the way local business taxes are allocated.
> 
> ""By scaling back central government's control and redistribution of this local business tax it will give them a genuine financial stake in their economy so local policy makers actively encourage growth and new businesses in their area.""

These announcements were included in the White Paper on Local Growth published today, which sets out the Government's new approach to rebalance the economy and drive sustainable growth by focusing on three key themes:

  * **shifting power to local communities and businesses** - by establishing dynamic local enterprise partnerships of local business and civic leaders, operating within an area that makes economic sense, which can provide the vision, knowledge and strategic leadership to set local priorities and empower communities to fulfil their potential
  * **increasing confidence to invest** - by creating the right conditions for growth through a consistent and efficient framework for investment, an effective planning framework and new incentives to make sure local communities benefit from development
  * **focused investment** - by tackling barriers to growth that the market will not address itself and supporting investment that will have a long term impact on growth

The first 24 local enterprise partnerships are:

  * Birmingham and Solihull with East Staffordshire, Lichfield and Tamworth
  * Cheshire and Warrington
  * Coast to Capital
  * Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly
  * Coventry and Warwickshire
  * Cumbria
  * Great Cambridge and Great Peterborough
  * Greater Manchester
  * Hertfordshire
  * Kent, Greater Essex and East Sussex

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1886591,Free advice for communities to support neighbourhood planning,"Communities are getting a supportive boost to help make their neighbourhood vision a reality through a new scheme offering free access to expert advice and guidance, Planning Minister Greg Clark announced today.

New powers being introduced in the Localism Bill will give local people a real voice to shape development in their area through a neighbourhood plan, from determining the locations of shops, offices and schools to setting the standards of design for new housing.

To ensure communities have the right support and advice to meet their own aspirations, Mr Clark has today announced four organisations with renowned expertise in planning who will share a £3.2m fund to provide assistance to local groups developing neighbourhood plans.

Communities can choose to take up free advice and guidance depending on their needs through The Prince's Foundation, Locality, The Royal Town Planning Institute, and the National Association of Local Councils in partnership with the Campaign to Protect Rural England.

Each organisation will use its expertise, skills and track record advising on development to empower communities to reach the full potential of their neighbourhood plan from start to finish, from understanding the planning process and finding local solutions through to developing clear documents and building community support. This will include free impartial advice, practical workshops with local authorities and community groups, tailored on-line resources, networking tools and telephone advice lines.

Greg Clark said:

> ""It is vital that grass root community groups are able to access specialist support and advice if their vision for their neighbourhood is to be truly realised. Making sure community groups have free access to a number of organisations means they can choose the experts that best suit their needs. All four organisations are specialists in their field and will provide an invaluable service to groups around the country, helping them to drive development and growth around their aspirations.""

Examples of work to support communities through the planning process include:

The Granville New Homes Resident Steering Group received training and support from the Building Community Consortium, which is led by Locality, during a £1bn regeneration project in South Kilburn, London. The award winning development delivered 130 new homes, a small park and a purpose built youth centre for the community.

The Prince's Foundation helped the community at Camp Hill, a former mining community in North Warwickshire, bring together the local council, developers and partners to develop a master plan which delivered a number of physical and social improvements for the town.

Hank Dittmar, Chief Executive of The Prince's Foundation, said:

> ""The Prince's Foundation has long been an advocate of the importance of community engagement and we are delighted to have been awarded such a significant proportion of the Communities and Neighbourhood Planning Grant.
> 
> ""Empowering local communities is now a welcome part of the planning process, and this grant will enable The Prince's Foundation to use its extensive track record to help people plan in a positive way for growth and better neighbourhoods.""

Steve Wyler, Chief Executive of Locality, said:

> ""We're delighted to be selected as one of only four partners to deliver the Government's Communities and Neighbourhoods in Planning Scheme. Our approach will enable communities to access highly specialised, independent advice and support from a nationwide pool of experts, helping them to find local solutions to local needs and change the built environment around them for good.""

Richard Summers, President of The Royal Town Planning Institute, added:

> ""We welcome the announcement made today. This funding will allow the RTPI's Planning Aid England service, in conjunction with Planning Aid for London, to provide information, advice and support to disadvantaged individuals and communities in shaping their neighbourhoods over the next twelve months.""

Cllr Michael Chater, Chairman of the National Association of Local Councils, said:

> ""The National Association of Local Councils wants local people to be able to shape the places they live in. We are therefore delighted to be part of this scheme. Our work over the coming year, with the lead partner, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, will help people understand the positive role that local and neighbourhood planning can play in bringing about appropriate development, while also protecting our environment. The message is: get involved in planning how our towns and villages will look in the future!""

### Notes to editors

#### The Prince's Foundation

The Foundation has a long history of successful projects based on the principles of community engagement. It believes that development can be both positive and enjoy popular support if it is the result of an engaging discussion with the local community and based around the local identity.

The services offered by Prince's Foundation through the grant will ensure they offer case specific solutions to communities based on live workshops with community groups and local authorities.

#### Locality

The Building Community Consortium will be led by Locality in partnership with Glass House Community Led Design, the Eden Project and communityplanning.net. The consortium will provide unparalleled knowledge, reach, skills and expertise in supporting disadvantaged and marginalised communities to engage with the built environment and the planning systems. It will provide support and networking to community groups through online resources and other networking tools, practical workshops and seminars, and tailored advice via a telephone advice line and other packages of support. The consortiums knowledge, skills and expertise can be found across a network of more than 1000 community-based organisations.

#### The Royal Town Planning Institute

The Royal Town Planning Institute will make the planning process more accessible and empower individuals, neighbourhoods and communities, especially those who are economically and socially disadvantaged, to become involved in shaping where they work, live and play.

It will provide free, independent, impartial, professional planning advice to people who do not have the means to pay professional fees. It will also provide support and training to local communities to influence and contribute to planning strategy, policy, and decision making at all levels, helping them to bring forward community planning initiatives. The service will promote and deliver good practice in community engagement be delivered through an extensive network of Planning Aid England and Planning Aid for London volunteers.

#### National Association of Local Councils in partnership with the Campaign to Protect Rural England

The advice and assistance offered by the NALC/CPRE partnership will draw on the strength and experience of its network of county branches and parish councils to enable local communities to better understand the planning system and share best practice.

As well as providing basic information about the planning system via a national website, a phone line and targeted publications, the grant will fund a programme of local events which will help inform local communities and parish councillors about how to influence local plans. The aim will empower local people and encouraging communities to take a more active and influential role in making plans for their areas.

#### The grants being made under the Supporting Communities and Neighbourhoods in Planning project are:

  * £1m The Royal Town Planning Institute
  * £814,000 Locality
  * £620,000 National Association of Local Councils in partnership with the Campaign to Protect Rural England
  * £800,000 The Prince's Foundation

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1666336,Free mapping data will plot route to innovation,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has hailed a new agreement between the Government and all public bodies that will allow them to use national mapping data for free.

The Public Sector Mapping Agreement (PSMA) will allow all parts of the public sector in England and Wales to access national mapping data and is expected to pave the way for a huge increase in new apps and websites that will improve public services.

### Improved services

This data will support a diverse range of services from the digital television switch over to reducing ambulance response times and improving school bus routes.

The new agreement will also allow councils to collaborate with private sector contractors and charities to deliver better, more innovative and more efficient local services.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""We're opening the door to a world of government information that will allow the good ideas of ordinary people to become innovative digital solutions that improve public services.
> 
> ""Easy access to high quality mapping data will trigger an eruption of new public sector mobile apps and digital mash ups that can quickly and cheaply improve local services, from refuse collections to protecting local birds and animals.
> 
> ""And this is just the start. We want ordinary people to come up with their own solutions to local problems that suit their needs. Across Government information is being made accessible and useful to as many people as possible in order to increase transparency and accountability. Individuals and communities will be able to get directly involved in issues that matter to them, and demand Government works harder to meet their needs.""

### Innovation success stories

The mapping data that will be made freely available has already been used to improve local services. An early innovator has been South Tyneside Council who created the 'My South Tyneside' web facility, enabling users to find schools libraries and other local facilities quickly and easily. The service also alerts users to local matters such as road works and local planning applications via email.

Cardiff City Council has also led the way by using Ordnance Survey data to improve free school bus services for local children, and in the process save money.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1768611,Freedom for councillors to champion their communities,"Councillors should be freed from restrictions that prevent them from championing local issues, Ministers have asserted today.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today set out plans to clarify the law so that councillors are able to get on with the job of representing their residents without fear of being challenged or their decisions being overturned because of accusations of inflexibility or unreasonable bias.

Ministers believe that the rules on bias, which councillors are expected to navigate and interpret, have left many councillors uncertain about whether they have the freedom to speak and vote on the very issues on which they campaigned and were elected to represent their constituents.

For example, councillors fear that if as a candidate they have opposed increases in car parking charges during their election campaign, they might be prevented from speaking or voting on the issue once in office because of accusations that they had a closed mind.

Ministers are looking to inject common sense back into the system. The forthcoming Localism Bill will clarify the law to give councillors the assurance they need to feel confident about campaigning on local issues and championing the rights of residents.

At the same time, Mr Pickles has suggested a strong new deterrent of criminal sanctions to prevent genuine town hall corruption. This would mean that failing to register or disclose a personal interest that impacts on council business could result in a court case, criminal conviction, fine or a ban on serving as a councillor.

Ministers believe these proposed sanctions will prove a far greater deterrent than those that might have been handed down under the old Standards Board Regime - such as being required to make an apology or suspension. The proposed changes are in addition to the abolition of the Councillors' Code of Conduct, which has already been announced by Ministers.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""This unnecessary bureaucracy restricting freedom of speech and preventing councillors from championing local issues like opposing damaging developments or higher parking charges is being replaced with real openness and transparency in how councils spend taxpayers' money and how decisions are made.""

Grant Shapps, Minister for Local Government, added:

> ""The changes will be a shot in the arm to local democracy, give councillors the certainty they need to get on and do their job, and give the public confidence that if corruption does occur it will be tackled. People who abuse their public office for personal gain should be brought before the criminal courts.""

### Notes for Editors

1. The Model Code of Conduct, enforced by the Standards Board for England, was established in 2000, it sets out rules governing elected members' activity and bars them from taking part in decisions where they had campaigned or expressed a predisposed view. Recent guidance issued by the Standards Board last year, even discouraged councillors from travelling in the same car when driving to a planning meeting to avoid ""appearance of bias. ""Scrapping the £8million a year Standards Board for England was announced earlier in the year: [www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1719944](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1719944).

#### 2. Coalition Government reforms

  * Ministers believe councillors are entitled to have and express their own views, as long as they are prepared to reconsider their position in the light of all the evidence and arguments. But both predetermination and bias have proved to be difficult and controversial issues for many local authority members and the local authority monitoring officers that advise members.
  * Predisposition is where a member holds a view in favour of, or against, an issue. For example an application for a planning permission. It includes having a preliminary view about how the member will vote before they attend the meeting and/or expressing that view publicly. They may even have been elected specifically because of their views on a particular issue. A member may make their view, and voting intention, clear in meetings, conversations, communications or campaigns or to the press, constituents, the public or officers of the local authority. And they may meet with those proposing or opposing a planning application to discuss their view on the matter.
  * Ministers believe a member should be free to seek to influence the views or decisions of other members by lobbying them. This attempt to influence the views and hence decisions of other members may be prompted by views that the member holds themselves, or if the member taking such steps to represent the interests of his ward or his constituents.
  * These proposed legislative changes will mean councillors can be very clear and discuss freely their view and voting intention and publicise their views as they see fit. However, councillors must be prepared to listen to arguments and evidence before making their decision. These changes will reduce the threat of challenge.
  * Councillors will have to conform to the highest standards of conduct. At present if a councillor abuses their position for personal gain it may result in a complaint to the local authority's standards committee with the councillor simply having to apologise. New proposals will make failing to register an interest, or deliberately seeking to mislead the public about an interest a criminal offence, overseen by the police, Crown Prosecution Service and the courts.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1903470,Freedom to fly: Pickles to cut red tape that stops the public from flying flags,"Eric Pickles today announced proposals to make it easier for people to fly flags of their choice without facing costly restrictions and red tape. The moves are intended to boost England's local and national identities and strengthen community cohesion.

Under current planning rules, only a select few flags are allowed to be flown without express permission from town hall officials. Getting this approval can incur fees of up to £335. In a speech to the Flag Institute, the Communities and Local Government Secretary is today announcing his intention to launch a consultation to allow a wider variety of important and historic flags to be flown by people keen to celebrate their local and national heritage and culture.

The last Government changed planning rules to allow the European Union flag to be flown without permission. The coalition Government will make it easier for communities wanting to celebrate the contribution of our armed forces by easing rules on flying local regimental flags. Other local flags, and projects like environmental awards, could also all be freed up from existing bureaucratic restrictions.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""If people want to celebrate something that is important to them by flying a flag they should be able to do so without having to fill in forms or paying town hall officials for the privilege. We will make it easier for people to celebrate their allegiance to a cause, a county or a local organisation if they choose to do so.""

Mr Pickles also used his speech to warn against misplaced political correctness stopping flags being flown:

> ""Local and national flags unite people of every creed, class and colour. Community cohesion is strengthened - not undermined - by flying the flag.""

Over the past year, the Department for Communities and Local Government has been flying county flags as a means of championing England's diverse local identities. Mr Pickles will stress the important of England's historic counties which were wiped off the administrative map in previous local government restructuring exercises.

On Monday, the Middlesex flag will be flown from the Department to mark Middlesex Day - and acknowledge the continuing role and identity of England's long-standing counties. Mr Pickles said:

> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete those longstanding and cherished local identities…""

### Notes to editors

Currently the only flags allowed to be flown without consent are any country's national flag; the European Union; the United Nations; the flag of the Commonwealth; the flag of any English county; and the flag of a patron saint which can be displayed only in the county with which the saint is associated.

Other flags can be flown with deemed consent. These are a person or organisation's own flag or one advertising an event taking place in the building it is being flown from. These flags must be flown from a vertical flagpole on the roof of the building.

The department's approach is to extend the categories of flags that may be flown either without consent or with deemed consent. Any flags outside these categories will continue to be prohibited without express consent.

Flags are deemed to be advertisements and their display is therefore controlled by the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007 No. 783). Certain flags can be flown without consent (see Schedule 1 Class H) and others can be flown with deemed consent (see Schedule 3 Class 7A). The difference is that deemed consent can be discontinued or restricted in certain circumstances.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1861489,Frozen Council Tax will help with cost of living,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles welcomes the news today that councils have taken up the Government's council tax freeze offer helping to keep this part of residents cost of living down at a critical time.

An independent survey published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) today has confirmed that council tax bills are to be frozen across England this year, thanks to the Government's council tax freeze initiative.

The Chartered Institure of Public Finance and Accountancy's survey estimates there will actually be a slight reduction of 35 pence on last year's council tax level. The average Band D English council tax bill will be £1,438.87.

The Government's own monitoring shows 333 councils in England have so far indicated that they will be taking up the Government freeze offer. A list of the councils is available to download at the bottom of the following page: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1854104](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1854104).

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Council tax has doubled in the last decade. But the Government has frozen council tax, saving hard-working families and pensioners up to £72 this year. We have scrapped a council tax revaluation and we want to give local residents new rights to veto excessive council tax rises in the future. This is real help now to assist with the cost of living.""

In the October Spending Review the Government confirmed that it would fund a council tax freeze in 2011-12, by providing a £650 million a year fund for local authorities over the Spending Review period. This offered authorities who do not put up their council tax a grant equivalent to increasing their council tax by 2.5 per cent.

The capping threshold in recent years was a 5 per cent council tax rise. Stopping such a rise in 2011-12 would therefore save a typical household up to £72. Should an average 2.5 per cent rise have occurred the saving would have been £36.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1665648,Garden grabbing concerns raised by new figures,"New figures have today laid bare concerns over the dramatic increase in the number of 'gardens grabbed' for development in the last 12 years.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said the statistics show the Government was right to take immediate action to prevent unwanted garden grabbing by changing the planning rules.

The percentage of new homes built on previously residential land - which includes back gardens - has increased to 25 per cent, up 14 percentage points since 1997, when only one in ten homes was built on similar land.

Last month, Greg Clark changed the planning rules to give councils new powers to prevent unwanted garden grabbing by taking gardens out of the brownfield category that includes derelict factories and disused railway sidings.

Many councils had been left frustrated at the increasing amount of inappropriate development on gardens which they have been unable to prevent. Taking gardens out of the brownfield category will dramatically transform councils' ability to prevent unwanted development on gardens where local people object and protect the character of their neighbourhoods.

Mr Clark said:

> ""For years local people were powerless to do anything about the blight of garden grabbing as the character of their neighbourhoods was destroyed and their wishes ignored.
> 
> ""We can see from these statistics that last year an even higher proportion of homes were built on previously residential land, which includes back gardens. Building on gardens robs communities of green breathing space, safe places for children to play and havens for urban wildlife.
> 
> ""It was ridiculous that gardens were classified in the same group as derelict factories and disused railway sidings. Now we've changed the classification of garden land, councils and communities will no longer have their decisions constantly overruled, and will have the power to work with industry to shape future development that is appropriate for their area.""

### Notes to editors

1. The proportion of new dwellings on previously residential land by local authority can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/xls/1665690.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/xls/1665690.xls).

2. Dr Simon Thornton Wood, Director of Science and Learning at the Royal Horticultural Society said:

> ""We welcome any measure that protects the vital resource we know gardens to be. Gardens like parks, are the green lungs of cities, improving air quality, controlling air temperature and flood risk and providing a haven for wildlife. Beyond these very practical benefits of gardens we know that gardening is great for physical and mental health. That's why we would like planning measures to go further than protecting existing gardens, to guarantee high quality green space and gardening opportunities in all new building developments, wherever they are.""

Richard Bashford - Project Manager, RSPB said:

> ""Gardens are mini nature reserves on our doorsteps and vital habitats for all sorts of wildlife. Many much loved species rely on green spaces like gardens, such as the song thrush and house sparrow, both of which have suffered massive declines in the last few years. House sparrow numbers have plummeted by over 60 per cent and we have lost almost 75 per cent of song thrushes. If more garden space is turned into buildings they will likely decline further and the wonder that children experience on the doorstep will dwindle.
> 
> ""We hope that the new measures will protect the habitats of species that have become synonymous with English gardens and demonstrate a rich eco system in our own back yards such as frogs, toads and bumble bees.""

3. The whole of any housing plot, including any garden, has been classed as ""Brownfield"" or previously developed land, in the same category and derelict factories and disused railway sidings. This incorporates development on previously residential land that includes gardens.

4. Reclassifying garden land will enable councils to protect gardens from inappropriate development by rejecting planning applications for development that is objected to by the local community and spoils the character of neighbourhoods.

5. The new Government recognises the concerns that some people have about the loss of gardens, and is amending Planning Policy Statement 3 (PPS3) to remove gardens from the classification of 'previously developed land'.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2128286,George Clarke appointed empty homes adviser,"Architect to lead efforts to bring empty homes back into use

Architect and TV presenter George Clarke is to be an independent adviser to the Government to help bring thousands of empty homes back into use for families in need of stable, secure homes, Ministers announced today.

![George Clarke](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2129162.jpg)George Clarke to be Empty Homes Adviser

Although the numbers of empty homes have fallen to their lowest level since 2004, there are still 720,000 homes sitting empty across the country - with 280,000 left vacant for six months or more.

Ministers have already announced £150 million to bring empty homes back into use as affordable housing - including £50 million to tackle clusters of empty homes.

George Clarke presented Channel 4's recent series of programmes, The Great British Property Scandal. His work as independent adviser on empty homes will particularly involve:

  * promoting bringing empty homes back into use
  * raising public awareness of the benefits of bringing empty homes back into use and encouraging people to report empty homes in their area
  * encouraging councils, housing associations and voluntary groups to identify innovative and good ideas and sharing this across communities
  * challenging Government and other public bodies to ensure publicly-owned homes are not left empty; and
  * exploring whether current plans for demolition in councils could be scaled back.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""I am delighted that George Clarke has agreed to work with us as we pull out all the stops to end the national scandal of empty homes.
> 
> ""For every two families needing a home, there's a property standing empty - properties that, all too often, attract squatters, vandalism and fly-tipping. That's why over the past year, I've made £150 million available to bring these homes back into use.
> 
> ""George's appointment as our independent adviser on this issue will give these efforts a real boost, and I look forward to seeing how communities benefit from his help and advice, and seeing more families benefiting from a secure, stable home as more empty properties are brought back into use.""

Independent Empty Homes Adviser George Clarke said:

> ""There are hundreds of thousands of empty homes that could and should be saved from the bulldozers and refurbished.
> 
> ""I totally support the building of new homes when it's necessary but not when it's cheaper and quicker to refurbish empty homes than to build from scratch. It can be kinder to communities and the environment - and it makes sense in these tough economic times.
> 
> ""I care passionately about this subject and I'll leave no stone unturned in my efforts to find a solution to the problem and get these houses back into use for the families who need them.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""George Clarke has been a phenomenal campaigner against the scourge of Empty Homes. His popular Great British Property Scandal programme raised the issue up the agenda. I'm pleased to report that the number of empty homes has fallen in the two years since this government came to office. Now we hope to accelerate that work further with £150 million of investment and George Clarke as our Empty Homes Adviser.""

### Notes to editors

1. Ministers have made £150 million available to communities to bring empty homes back into use. This is comprised of:

  * £70 million for councils to bring over 5,600 empty homes back into use

  * £30 million for community groups; and

  * £50 million to tackle clusters of empty homes.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1647342,Giving healthcare power to local people,"Local people and professionals will have much more say in shaping healthcare in their areas - and NHS, social care and public health services will work closer together.

The Secretaries of State for Health and Communities and Local Government have today set out proposals on how patients, locally elected councillors, local authorities, public health experts and others will work side by side with GP consortia to make health services meet the needs of people in local areas and improve health outcomes.

This partnership, led by local authorities, will mean services become more responsive, and be developed in ways that fit around the people who use them.

Patients and the public will also have a stronger voice through a new patient group, local HealthWatch - a 'citizen's advice bureau' for health and social care. Local people from HealthWatch would also influence local plans ensuring they fit community needs.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""A decade of centralising, controlling government has left public services like the NHS strangled with red tape, lumbered with target after target, and weakened by the need to report to bureaucrats instead of the public.
> 
> ""Under proposals published today, for the first time in forty years there will be local democratic accountability and legitimacy in the NHS.
> 
> ""Elected councils will have a key role including commissioning HealthWatch services to guarantee patients a voice. As we push power away from Whitehall we will make the health service more answerable to patients not politicians."" 

Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley, said:

> ""Power has to be devolved to local people so that decisions about their health are made by them, or by people that best understand their needs.
> 
> ""Whitehall can't prescribe all of this, and the health service shouldn't wait for a rulebook from Government. Everyone should have their say in these consultations so we can get on with building strong local partnerships and improve people's health.""

The proposals also mean that health can be considered alongside other crucial services like education and housing - recognising the impact that these services can have on individuals and families health - for example suitable housing can help older people stay safe, healthy and independent.

### How local NHS, public health, and care services will be shaped

The Government is asking for views from the public, health professionals, and anyone else with an interest in local health issues, on two public consultations launched today:

  * Commissioning for Patients; and
  * Local Democratic Legitimacy in Health.

The White Paper [ _Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS_ ](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_117353) (external link) proposed crucial elements of a truly personalised and local health system that will make it easier for everyone to shape local health services and hold them to account in the future.

Within a ring-fenced public health budget local health improvement funds will be held by local authorities, and decisions about how this is spent will take account of all the local issues that impact on people's wellbeing. Local Directors of Public Health will be crucial to this process, and the national Public Health Service, when created, will complement local decision making with evidence, research, and evaluation.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2124553,Giving local businesses an Easter tax break,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill is writing to every local council today urging them to make sure every single local firm in their areas knows about all the Government measures available to give businesses a tax break and the breathing room to grow and prosper.

Small shops and businesses are at the centre of the local economy and the Government is determined to make sure the support on offer to hundreds of thousands of firms is taken up so they can thrive.

Government has doubled small business rate relief for two and a half years so the average tax benefit is around £1650; the Localism Act now makes it easier for firms to claim the relief they are entitled to; given councils the power to offer their additional local discounts; and allowed businesses to spread the inflation increase over three years.

The call to councils comes on the day the application for business rates deferral scheme opens. This gives thousands of local business the opportunity to delay paying some of this year's rates bill for up to three years worth potentially £600 million if all English firms, covering over one and a half million businesses properties, took up the offer.

The deferral scheme offers businesses a much needed tax break making a real difference to running costs, help them to get on top of cash flow and giving time to adjust to inflation changes.

44,000 business properties in Birmingham could defer over £11 million; Bristol has 14,000 properties, Liverpool and Sheffield with 16,000 each could defer over £5 million; Manchester has 22,000 properties eligible for up to £8 million; Newcastle's 9,000 could get discounts worth £4 million; Plymouth has almost 7,000 that could save over £2 million; and London businesses could benefit from a £165 million reprieve across 285,000 properties.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Small shop and firms are at the heart of our communities, and it has never been more important to support them as they help rebuild and re-grow this country's economy for the future. We have set up all these rate reprieves because we know local firms need a little more breathing space to make ends meet.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government has taken action to make sure there are a series of measures in place that support businesses and promote economic growth. It is vital that councils make sure every firm in their area know about the offers available - like the fact that our Localism Act means the double discount for small firms, worth millions, is now easier to claim than ever before, or that there is a three year interest deferral out there - so they are taken up.""

The other business rates support available is as follows:

  * Small Business Rate Relief has been doubled for two and a half years. This tax break is typically worth £1,650 over the period. Around half a million small firms and shops are eligible for over three quarters of a billion pounds worth of discount. Around 330,000 will pay no rates at all over this period. In some areas as many as two in five firms are eligible.

  * New local discounts are available through the Localism Act so councils can actively target their own businesses rate discounts in the best way for local businesses. This can be used to encourage new business investment, support for local shops, the high street or community services. Councils should consider this new power alongside the Government's 'Portas Pilots' plans.

  * The 24 Enterprise Zones can give one hundred per cent discounts to new businesses to their sites for five years. Authorities are responsible for providing the discounts using the new local discounts powers. Central Government is meeting the costs of the discount.

  * Cancelled £175 million of unfairly backed business rates liabilities that affected many firms including those in ports. Hundreds of port-based businesses facing thousands of unfair and unexpected backdated business rates bills can breathe a sigh of relief as Government action to waive and repay their bills has finally lifted their heavy debt burden which threatened thousands of British jobs.

  * A £10 million High Street Innovation Fund is available to a hundred local authorities to support empty properties on our high streets, and those areas affected by the riots, helping kick start new business and revive neighbourhoods.

In recognition of the vital role of local authorities have in nurturing new enterprise supporting local business the Government is changing the way they are funded so they retain a share of their local business rate growth. Those councils that encourage local growth and enable firms to succeed will see the fruits of their labours returned to reinvest in the local area.

To further boost to locally driven economic growth the Government last week announced it's 'Portas Plus' response the Mary Portas High Street. This includes a help package that rewards creativity and innovation and gives local people a genuine stake in the success of their towns.

Further information about the business rate discounts available is on the Business Link website: [www.businesslink.gov.uk](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk) (external link). Business Link is Government's online resource for businesses that contains essential practical information, support and services business whether a large organisation or a new start up.

### Notes to editors

1. The regulations to implement the spreading the Retail Price Index increase in business rates bills over three years have now been laid. This will give businesses the chance to defer payment of 3.2 per cent of their 2012-13 rates bills until 2013-14 and 2014-15. The legislation stipulates that provided ratepayers return the application by 9 June 2012 they will see the reduction in their July 2012 instalments. This allows sufficient time for authorities to update their software and prepare for the scheme. Local authorities will no doubt wish to take every opportunity to promote this scheme to ratepayers. Council town centre managers are being encouraged to make the deferral application form and helpful fact sheet available to local firms. Details of how much this scheme is potentially worth in every area can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2124529.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2124529.xls) (Excel, 110kb). 

2. Local areas from all parts of the country are getting additional help, worth on average £1650 over the period for each qualifying firm. Eligible businesses occupying property with a rateable value of up to £6,000 pay no rates for that period, with tapering relief up to a rateable value to £12,000. Government has also made it easier for authorities to get the relief to ratepayers by removing the legal requirement for ratepayers to submit an application form.

3. All parts of the country are getting the double discount help - nearly 6,000 small firms in Bradford are getting the discount; nearly 5,000 in Durham, 2,000 in Harrogate; over 1,500 businesses in Enfield; Wakefield nearly 3,500; Shropshire 3,700; Sheffield 4,400; and Kirklees has over 5,000 small businesses getting relief. In Cornwall over 10,000 business properties are receiving discounts; with 3,000 in Bournemouth; while Suffolk Coast, North Norfolk, Poole, Southend, South Lakeland, Blackpool and Scarborough are helping over 2000 properties each. More details about the number and share of small firms and shops, for every area of the country, that received a rate reprieve are available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/19726081.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/1972654.xls) (Excel, 205kb).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1788479,Gloucestershire flag flying at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Gloucestershire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended earlier this year by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Dame Janet Trotter DBE, Lord-Lieutenant of Gloucestershire said:

> ""Gloucestershire Cathedral; the beauty of the Forest of Dean; the excitement of the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival; the wooded slopes of the Cotswolds and the serenity of Tewkesbury Abbey are among aspects of the historic county of Gloucestershire of which we are proud.
> 
> ""The county has a 1000 year history but a lively modern economy which has many award winning industries and businesses. Today we value our diverse local communities and our commitment to supporting one another whatever the need: this was particularly demonstrated during the 2007 floods when we demonstrated a community spirit which continues to this day.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1991340,Going green with new cycle routes planned for North Solihull,"People in North Solihull are going green in a bid to access jobs, with the creation of a new 8-mile network of cycle friendly routes to top employment areas, making cycling a cheap, healthy and environmentally friendly way for people to get to and from work.

Supported by over £1.3 million from the European Regional Development Fund which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and match funded by Solihull Council, the North Solihull Strategic Cycle project is part of a package of activities to develop and improve the North Solihull area.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""These new cycle routes will improve the environment and support struggling communities and their residents by helping individuals to access employment opportunities. This cycle network aims to help boost access to employment opportunities providing a way for people to get to and from work and improve the local economy.""

Local businesses will be encouraged to embrace this eco-friendly means of travel with grants available for improving facilities for cyclists - from cycle parking to changing facilities. Assistance in setting up 'Bike to Work' schemes, offering a bike pool and lunch time rides to keep fit, will also be available.

This project, which is funded by the European Regional Development Fund fits well with the programme for sustainable urban development and provides support for those seeking employment.

Councillor Ian Courts, Cabinet Member for Economic Development at Solihull Council, said:

> ""This new cycle route is another important investment that we are making into North Solihull. It underlines the commitment that we are making to improve transport options, as well as give other means of access to employment. We still have a lot of work to do to encourage more people to adopt what really is a healthy, and enjoyable, means of getting to work, but are working hard with employers to get their support on this.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1799233,"Government ""open for business"" as new barrier busting service launched","Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today launched a new service designed to help volunteers, community groups and social enterprises overcome bureaucracy and get things done in their neighbourhood.

Many people have ingenious and innovative ideas for how they could make their street, town or village a better place to live. There is a long tradition of community action across the country, with local groups who do everything from cleaning up street litter, to running community centres, to investing in small-scale green energy.

In some cases, however, would-be volunteers or social entrepreneurs feel that bureaucracy holds them back - whether it's bye-laws, health and safety rules, or planning regulations. In some cases, discussion with the council can resolve problems locally, but in others the only way is for central government to take action.

From today, councils, community groups, local institutions and individuals who need central government's help to get rid of barriers can submit a request through the web at [http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link). Everyone who submits a query, will be given an individual number to track the progress of their request and the contact details of a named person they can talk to from a dedicated team of ""barrier busters"" - senior civil servants in the Government who will help find ways to let local people take control.

Greg Clark said:

> ""As a Minister I have a team of Civil Servants to turn my ideas into action. But if you believe, as I do, that most of the best ideas come from people in communities, then I think they should have the help that Ministers enjoy.
> 
> ""Local people often have brilliant ideas and are keen to get involved in making their neighbourhood a better place.  Government rules and regulations should be there to support them - not stand in their way.
> 
> ""The barrier busting service is there to find practical solutions and give local people's enthusiasm and commitment free rein. This is about turning government on its head.
> 
> ""Instead of Whitehall telling authorities what to do, central government will be listening to councils and communities and helping them achieve their own ambitions - whether that's by cutting red tape, amending regulation to be less burdensome, or creating new local discretion over how taxpayers' money is spent.""

The Government is also publishing an action plan which describes what it is already doing to lift barriers in response to requests made by councils and communities under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. It is inviting councils to talk to their communities again, under the terms of the Act, about what needs to be done to improve local life - and to submit fresh ideas of how government can help unlock local ambitions.

Mr Clark also said that the chance to request change under the Act should not be a ""one off"" opportunity for councils, and that there will no longer be deadlines or timelines for them to submit barriers.

Councils who ask for change using the terms of the Act that cannot be solved by the barrier busting team will have the chance to turn to a panel of experts from local government, who will engage with central government on the most serious barriers to localism.

The Action Plan from the first Sustainable Communities Act is the result of a list of 312 barriers short-listed by the Local Government Association in 2009. Today, the Action Plan sets out how the government is responding. Proposals included:

  * Doncaster, Liverpool and Sheffield all wanted greater local control of Post Offices. Today, a pilot in Sheffield may produce lessons relevant to all three councils.
  * Poole asked for a reduction in ringfencing of local government grants. The Comprehensive Spending Review created significant new local discretion in finances.
  * Wirral wanted it to be easier for local communities to take control of assets. Measures in the Localism Bill are designed to achieve this.

Mr Clark also set out three main changes to the Sustainable Communities Act to make it less bureaucratic, more flexible and ultimately better at putting power in local hands. They are:

  * Removing timetables that dictated when and how councils could put up requests.
  * Consulting on the role of 'selector'. Last time around, proposals were sent to the LGA - not the Government - who sifted and prioritised the requests that came in.
  * Extending the invitation to community groups through the new barrier busting service.

Steve Shaw, National Co-ordinator of Local Works, the coalition that campaigned for the Sustainable Communities Act to become law, said:

> ""Thousands of people in hundreds of council areas have already engaged with the Sustainable Communities Act by putting forward proposals to government. This democratic involvement was fantastic to see. We thank Greg Clark and his department for dealing with all the proposals made so far under the Act expeditiously.
> 
> ""We welcome his intention to extend the invitation for proposals to community groups, his establishment of an ongoing process through this invitation and his plan to consult on revising the role of the 'selector'. I urge communities and councils to engage now in this exciting new form of 'bottom up' governance.""

### Notes to editors

1. The new barrier busting web address is [http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link).

2. The first invitation of the Sustainable Communities Act was issued by the previous Government on 14 October 2008. It called for local authorities to submit proposals which they believed would improve the social, economic or environmental well-being of their local area, but would need the Secretary of State's assistance to make happen.

3. The Government has today decided proposals submitted by local authorities in 2009 under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. We have placed these decisions in the Library of the House and online at  
[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/scadecisions](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/scadecisions). The 'Sustainable Communities Act 2007' can be seen here: [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/23/contents](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/23/contents) (external link).

4. 100 local authorities submitted proposals to the Local Government Association, appointed as 'selector', in July 2009. They presented a short-list of 199 proposals - containing over 300 separate requests - to the previous government in December that year.

5. The proposals being taken forward under the Act echo the Localism Bill, which will give people more say, more choice and more ownership of their local services.

6. The Government will consult in the New Year on regulations which will govern the relationship with a revised 'selector', who will have the opportunity to engage with the Secretary of State on barriers that cannot be removed.

7. Common barriers to community action include:

  * Business In the Community's survey of 320 members suggests 80 per cent say they can do more to support communities, but are held back by red tape.
  * Restrictions cited include Criminal Records Bureau checks on volunteering.
  * Rules that prevent welfare claimants from taking part-time jobs or longer work placements.
  * Competition laws that prevent businesses from collaborating on sector-wide initiatives.
  * Health and Safety regulation.
  * Public Liability Insurance and Catering licences running stalls at events.
  * CRB checks.
  * Red tape on smaller organisations.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1957813,Government action puts stalled regeneration project back on track,"Swift action by the Government has restored the flow of regeneration funding from the European Union after a period of interruption caused by irregularities in projects, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The European Commission has confirmed it is lifting an interruption to payments of European Regional Development Funding (ERDF) in England following the implementation of a new regime of tighter controls on projects. The lifting of the interruption gives the Government a clean bill of health over its plans to tighten the administration of European funding programmes.

The Commission temporarily interrupted the payment of funds after an annual audit found a number of irregularities in projects.

The Commission has welcomed new measures taken by the Government to standardise monitoring systems and introduce a strict programme of enhanced checks.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The ERDF programme has been plagued by a legacy of poor administration and fines that dates back to 2000. The Coalition Government has overhauled the management of these schemes, bringing them in-house, and successfully minimising the liabilities.
> 
> ""The measures that this Government has taken have been recognised by the European Commission which has just announced that payments for the ERDF programme will restart, allowing vital regeneration work to continue.""

Administration of European Regional Development Funding had been the responsibility of Regional Development Agencies. Following the closure of these agencies management and administration of the ERDF programme moved in-house to the Department for Communities and Local Government on 1 July.

The £3bn programme aids regeneration of communities by bringing together a range of partners, including local councils, who develop projects that promote economic development and produce benefits to local communities.

### Notes to editors

1. On 31 March 2011 the European Commission wrote to the Department to order the interruption of the 2007-2013 programme of European Regional Development Funding, over concerns about how the programme had been managed. Following further correspondence from the Department setting out measures to address and improve standards of programme management, the European Commission has now confirmed (in a letter of 27 July 2011) that it is satisfied with these measures and is lifting the interruption.

2. The Government's inherited potential liabilities for ERDF projects between 2000 and 2006 were estimated at £191m for the financial year 2009/10. However further investigation identified additional liabilities, taking the total liability to £236m. The Department has managed to reduce this total by over £63m throughout the 2010/11 financial year, to £172m (as published in the 2010-11 Annual Report). The Department has accepted that £38.1m of this residual figure cannot be recovered, and is seeking to recover the remaining amount. The 2010-11 Annual Report is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/annualreport1011](http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/publications/corporate/annualreport1011).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1854104,Government action securing Council Tax freeze for residents,"Today Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles praises 'can freeze' councils who are saying yes to the Government's offer to help keep local council tax payers' cost of living down at a critical time.

The nation faces an unprecedented financial situation and every part of the public sector, including local government, which accounts for a quarter of all public expenditure, has a part to play in cutting the deficit.

New figures show over three hundred and thirty councils in England have so far indicated that they will be taking up the Government offer to fund a council tax freeze in April through its £650m fund. This gives authorities who do not put up their council tax a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax income. The freeze means local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £70.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I welcome the news that almost every council has said it wants to take part in the Government's £650 million council tax freeze initiative.
> 
> ""This shows that local authorities can freeze council tax for residents helping them manage their monthly outgoings whilst working hard to protect frontline services. Tackling the nation's deficit is the Governments biggest priority but we have made this money available to help hard working families and pensioners tired of seeing their council tax bill go up.""

A fair and progressive funding settlement for councils that protects front-line services and shields the most vulnerable communities with significant social challenges was confirmed last month. For example, residents in Hackney will receive £1,043 per head and those in Wokingham will receive £125 per head.

£29.4bn of council grant has been fairly distributed between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. As a result councils will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall.

Local authorities have already been given full control over £7bn of funding, all non-schools ring fenced grants have been removed, councils and the NHS are being brought closer together and the bureaucratic burdens associated with inspection and targets have been removed.

Stopping a 5 per cent council tax rise (the capping threshold in recent years) would therefore save £71 in 2011-12. Should an average 2.5 per cent rise have occurred the saving would have been £35.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1911233,Government announces £2.1 million funding to Auschwitz-Birkenau foundation,"Today Foreign Secretary William Hague and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced a £2.1 million Government contribution to the preservation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp to help ensure the lessons of Auschwitz live on for generations to come. The contribution is primarily funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The money will be used to ensure the long-term preservation and restoration of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and its important place in educating people of the horrors of the Holocaust.

Speaking at the Jewish Museum in London, the Communities Secretary emphasised the significance of remembering the Holocaust and reiterated the Government's commitment to working with all of Britain's different communities to put an end to prejudice and hatred in all its forms.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Auschwitz-Birkenau is an important place of remembrance. It is vital that we do not forget it. Just as we collect and preserve the stories of eyewitnesses, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that Auschwitz-Birkenau stands as a perpetual reminder of the pain and destructive force of hate. We must ensure that the lessons from the Holocaust are taught today and to future generations. Today I am proud to reaffirm the Government's commitment to remembering the Holocaust.""

The Foreign Secretary William Hague said:

> ""I am determined that the Government should take an active approach to preserving the memory of the Holocaust. Auschwitz-Birkenau is a searing reminder of the horrific consequences of intolerance and hatred. It should never be forgotten. I am proud that the UK is able to play a part in commemorating the millions of victims who died there, educating future generations of the evils of that period in history and ensuring its preservation for many years to come.""

Sir Andrew Burns, UK Envoy for post-Holocaust issues said:

> ""Auschwitz-Birkenau is a symbol of the horrors of the Holocaust and a warning of what can happen when hatred is allowed to flourish. The number of visitors to the camp continues to grow, showing that it has become a place of reflection and commemoration for the whole world. There is a continued need for a place people can visit to learn about and understand what happened. The preservation of the camp will enable us to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive for future generations.""

Lord Greville Janner of Braunstone, Chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust, commented:

> ""Auschwitz-Birkenau is the site of the largest mass murder in human history and an iconic symbol of the Holocaust. The Holocaust Educational Trust has urged the UK Government to provide financial support for the upkeep of the site and today's commitment of £2.1 million sends a clear message that we have a responsibility to safeguard the future of the camp.
> 
> ""Through our Lessons from Auschwitz Project the Holocaust Educational Trust gives over 3,000 British students each year the opportunity to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau, this announcement will ensure that when young people visit Auschwitz, they will see for themselves what can happen when racism and prejudice is allowed to go unchecked.""

Eric Pickles was joined today at the Jewish Museum by the Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks and the Polish Ambassador, Barbara Tuge-Erecinska. They were given a tour of the Museum and had the opportunity to listen in on a talk being given to local schoolchildren by Holocaust survivor Mala Tribich.

### Notes to editors

1. The funding, delivered over the next three years, is a joint contribution primarily from the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Foreign and Commonwealth office.

2. The Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation hopes to establish a Perpetuity Fund of €120 million by 2015 to ensure the consolidation, restoration and long-term maintenance of the Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps. The Foundation's proposal will ensure that further funding will not be sought for the preservation of the camps in the foreseeable future as the proceeds from the invested Perpetuity Fund will be used to fund on-going restoration works.

> 
> ""There will be no reduction to the £29bn general grant that local government receives every year meaning that they have the flexibility they need to protect the frontline. But this is also an opportunity to devolve real power to councils. By removing ringfencing and red tape and freeing up resources councils will be free to focus on delivering essential services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1944574,Government announces new Affordable Homes programme set to exceed expectations,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today hailed the progress of Government plans to build thousands of new affordable homes over the next four years.

Ministers revealed that their original aspiration to deliver 150,000 new homes by 2015 will not only be met, but exceeded. Appetite for the Affordable Homes Programme has surpassed expectations, with 146 providers sharing almost £1.8 billion to build 80,000 homes under the programme - putting the Government on track to deliver up to 170,000 new homes by 2015, and safeguarding some 80,000 jobs in construction and related trades.

The programme allows social housing providers to charge a rent of up to 80 per cent of the local market level, and use the additional income to support delivery of more affordable homes. Providers may also offer flexible tenancies to new tenants.

Demand from affordable housing providers to be involved in the programme has been huge, and today's announcement confirms every part of England will benefit. The new homes will be delivered in both rural and urban communities, and will include family homes.

Mr Shapps said that funding for the scheme, which is part of a £4.5 billion Government investment in affordable housing, will provide a major boost to people on housing waiting lists, and give a shot in the arm to the construction industry.

Subject to contract, these landlords will now be able to start developing much-needed new affordable homes. This is one of a number of efforts being made to move away from the 'one size fits all' system of social housing to one where a range of options are available to meet local housing needs.

Ministers believe that for years millions of people have been on waiting lists with little hope of ever getting a home. That's why the Government has pledged to do things differently, radically reforming social housing in order to give councils and housing associations more control so they can better meet the needs of the people they serve and build more homes.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Affordable Homes Programme has received a ringing endorsement from the sector and confounded the critics, who said the programme would not deliver in the current climate. So I'm pleased to announce that 146 providers are in line to share almost £1.8 billion cash to develop 80,000 new homes, many of which will be larger homes for families.
> 
> ""There were some who predicted doom and said very few would want to be involved in this radical new approach. Others said it would work in the south east but nowhere else. But we now have a wealth of strong proposals, putting us on track to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes across the country over the next four years.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""To have millions of people stuck on social housing waiting lists is wrong, and denies homes to those who need them. The thousands of new affordable homes that will be delivered under this programme will start to put things right. The new homes will be in towns, cities and rural areas right across the country, and include many homes for families. They'll provide a lifeline to those on waiting lists, and a shot in the arm for the construction industry.""

Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, which is delivering the Affordable Homes Programme, added:

> ""The extremely strong response to the new Affordable Homes Programme shows the appetite among the agency's partners to deliver. Through our bidding process our local teams have worked with partners to achieve value for money and the best outcome for communities, the result being that we are now on course to deliver around 80,000 new homes far exceeding expectations.""

The flexible tenancies under the Affordable Homes Programme will be for new tenants only - the lifetime tenancies and succession rights of existing council and housing association tenants will not be affected.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1831509,Government confirms progressive settlement and fair deal for communities,"Final arrangements for a fair and progressive funding settlement for councils that protect front-line services and shield the most vulnerable have been published today by Local Government Minister Bob Neill.

Council will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and the grant has been adjusted so none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall.

This settlement reflects the desire to support areas with the most need and the urgent obligation to bring the country's public finances back in order, keep interest rates down and prevent the national debt escalating beyond £1.4 trillion of taxpayers' money.

Ministers have consulted widely with the Local Government Association, London Councils and many individual local authorities, listening to concerns raised. Having considered all views, Ministers have today confirmed the proposals for the distribution of formula grant for 2011-12 as announced in December.

The final settlement:

  * allocates a total Government Revenue Grant of £72.7bn to Local Authorities in 2011-12;
  * distributes £29.4bn in formula grant in 2011-12 and £27.1 bn for 2012-13;
  * keeps the average revenue spending power reduction for 2011-12 at only 4.4 per cent and reduces the upper limit from 8.9 per cent to 8.8 per cent;
  * increases Transitional Grant to £96m in 2011-12 and £21m in 2012-13;
  * makes a further £10m available through Formula Grant to compensate Shire Districts for the loss of concessionary travel funding in 2011-12;
  * ensures a fair distribution between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire;
  * creates four new grant bands or 'floors' with different limits that protect those most dependent on grant against potentially steeper reductions.

Mr Neill said:

> ""We urgently need to reduce the country's public spending and local government accounts for around a quarter of all public expenditure so councils have a big part to play.
> 
> ""We have listened to views and looked hard at the figures and have pushed more money to those most dependent on grant so now no council will face a reduction of more than 8.8 per cent and shire districts will get £10m to compensate for the loss of concessionary bus travel funding.
> 
> ""These extra steps once again show we have worked to deliver a fair and progressive approach that directs grant to where it is most needed - the vulnerable and needy - whilst protecting taxpayers.""

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles added:

> ""This goes hand in hand with the new localism powers and spending freedoms we are handing councils so they can be as efficient and effective as possible with public funds, rooting out waste and focusing on frontline public services.""

The Coalition Government remains committed to protecting local taxpayers. A growing number of councils have already indicated that they will be taking up the Government offer to fund a council tax freeze in April through its £650million fund. Authorities who do not increase their council tax are eligible for a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax.

Today, the Government have also confirmed a further £5million funding to encourage the newly-formed Local Enterprise Partnerships and new Local Authority partnerships to work together across boundaries to deliver large scale housing and regeneration schemes in key growth and Housing Market Renewal locations.

The settlement is set against the background of the most radical shift in power to local government for a generation. Local authorities have already been given full control over £7 billion of funding, all non-schools ring fenced grants have been removed, councils and the NHS are being brought closer together and the bureaucratic burdens associated with inspection and targets have been removed.

### Notes to editors

1. The final settlement has now been agreed by Ministers and will be proposed to Parliament:

2011-12: [www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1112/spfull1s.xls](http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1112/spfull1s.xls) (external link - Excel, 256 kb)  
2012-13: [www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1112/spfull2s3.xls](http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1112/spfull2s3.xls) (external link - Excel, 210 kb)

2. The provisional 2011-12 allocations were first announced on 13 December 2010 and a consultation ran until 17 January 2011: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1796009](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1796009).

3. The Government has given more weight to those parts of the country with the highest levels of need. For example, funding per head for residents in Hackney in 2011-12 will be £1043 compared with £125 per head in Wokingham. Full details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/1831500.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/1831500.xls) (Excel, 456 kb).

4. In December, Ministers established a transitional grant of £85m for 2011-12 and £14m in 2012-13 to help councils manage issues around the Working Neighbourhoods Fund, a three year fund scheduled to end in March 2011.

5. Around a quarter of all council revenue is raised through council tax. The amount raised by individual councils through council tax varies, dependent on the nature of the area. Revenue from council tax, along with other income a council receives, determines the overall level of a councils spending power. The more dependent a council is on formula grant funding from central government to fund their budgets, the lower their spending power. _A Plain English Guide to the Local Government Finance Settlement for 2011-12_ is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf) (PDF, 49 kb, 9 pages).

6. In 2010 it was proposed that the responsibility for all concessionary travel be moved from the lower (district) tier to the upper (county level) tier. The transfer of funding for concessionary travel was a concern raised with Ministers during the consultation by a number of authorities. Ministers have decided to help compensate Shire District councils for the loss of what they used to receive for concessionary travel. To address this, a further £10m has been added to Formula Grant - for 2011-12 only - in order to mitigate the impact of the transfer of responsibility and funding to county councils.

7. The Government is further prepared to take capping action against excessive increases.

8. The Localism Bill contains a radical package of reforms that will devolve greater power and freedoms to councils, Fire and Rescue Authorities, and neighbourhoods, establish powerful new rights for communities, revolutionise the planning system, and give communities control over housing decisions.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1875925,Government consults on plans to increase accountability and efficiency in local auditing,"Proposals for establishing a new decentralised, local audit regime that will replace the Audit Commission are being set out today for consultation.

Ministers believe that the current system of local auditing where the Audit Commission is the regulator, commissioner and provider of local audit services are inefficient and unnecessarily centralised.

In August last year the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced plans to disband the Audit Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold their councils and other public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

The proposals - set out today for consultation - set out a new approach to audit based on four key principles:

  * localism and decentralisation - freeing up local public bodies, subject to appropriate safeguards, to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market, while ensuring a proportionate approach for smaller bodies
  * transparency - ensuring that the results of audit work are easily accessible to the public, helping local people to hold councils and other local public bodies to account for local spending decisions
  * lower audit fees - remove the overheads charged by the Audit Commission to service the central government machine
  * high standards of auditing - ensuring that there is effective and transparent regulation of public audit, and conformity to the principles of public audit.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Audit Commission has lost its way, becoming too focused on reporting to Whitehall and supporting the previous era of target driven Government.
> 
> ""The options we are developing for a future audit regime will shift power from Westminster to people, save taxpayers money, deliver high standards of auditing practice and maintain inspection and intervention arrangements for the most vulnerable.""

The Government is committed to disbanding the Audit Commission after 2012. Today's consultation builds on a programme of work already undertaken to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of auditing arrangements including the abolition of the Comprehensive Area Assessments and the stopping of the Commissions research and inspection activities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1654087,Government ends regionalisation of fire services,"Action that will stop the forced regionalisation of fires services and hand more control back to local services will be announced by Fire Minister Bob Neill today as part of the Government's promise to abolish regional government and give stronger powers and responsibilities to communities.

Speaking at an event that will bring together Fire and Rescue Authorities and Services from around the country, the Minister will announce that Services no longer have to work through Regional Management Boards, ending one of the last layers of regional bureaucracy.

This is the latest step in abolishing regional government and follows recently announced plans to scrap Regional Development Agencies and Regional Assemblies. The Government has also announced it is minded to abolish the nine Government Offices for the Regions.

Central government is stepping aside so Fire Authorities can decide what their priorities should be and what is in the best interests of the communities they serve. There will be an immediate shift in approach in a number of areas where the Service is currently 'directed' unnecessarily by Government.

Fire chiefs will be told that Government will no longer needlessly intervene where the National Framework is not strictly adhered to. Issues which will now also be left to local decisions include equality and diversity, and workforce development.

During the event attendees from across the sector will begin work that will help plan the future of the service. The Minister will be asking them to consider big questions such as the shape and role of the sector in the future, how they can be more efficient, how they can contribute to the Big Society, and whether a National Framework is really needed.

Mr Neill said:

> ""The coalition Government is committed to stopping regional government and cutting away unnecessary layers of bureaucracy by pushing power into the hands of communities.
> 
> ""We have fantastic Fire and Rescue Services in this country and it's time we stopped tying them up in red tape and give them more freedom to serve their communities. We rely on our firefighters to keep us safe not waste resources on bureaucracy.
> 
> ""Fire and Rescue Services are mature enough and professional enough to make their own decisions and to work together to make continuous improvements. I know the sector is keen to step up and show that they are more than capable of supporting their own.""

In recognition of Services' willingness to support each other the Government will be ending its formal engagement with Cornwall Fire and Rescue Authority.

The Chief Fire Officers Association and Local Government Association will help the Cornwall FRA continue to improve and carry forward the progress that has already been made.

The Government will now only intervene in extreme cases and will instead work with the sector to look at alternative ways to support fire and rescue services.

### Notes to editors

1. The Fire Minister raised questions about aspects of the National Framework at the national Fire and Rescue 2010 conference on Tuesday 29 June and announced work that will help plan the future of the Service.

2. The Minister recognises that the 2008/11 Framework remains in force and, without fettering his discretion, he will no longer expect to enforce the following aspects of the Framework:

  * **Regional Management Boards** - he will allow freedom for individual authorities to work on a collaborative basis in a way that works best locally and is not determined by regional boundaries. These Boards were established in 2003 and are made up of Fire and Rescue Authorities grouped together by their relevant Government Office region.
  * **Equality and Diversity** - he will not be enforcing recruitment, retention and progression targets or monitoring compliance with the National Strategy. This is an area where leadership and commitment should come from within the Service. The Service should choose to challenge itself.
  * **Workforce Development** - he will not be telling Services how to recruit or develop their staff. Employers know best how to meet workforce requirements.
  * **Asset management** - he will not be telling Services how to manage their assets, such as buildings. Services can be trusted to manage their own estates.

3. The work to help plan the future of the fire and rescue service begins with a workshop, today, to be led by the Minister. Participants from the sector will be encouraged to think radically about localism, decentralisation and the future challenges the Service faces. The ideas generated from this workshop will inform the review work streams and flesh out the terms of reference agreed by Ministers. The review is expected to report later in the year.

4. In 2009 the Audit Commission published a highly critical Corporate Assessment of Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service, giving it the lowest ranking of 'poor'. CLG appointed a lead official to work with Cornwall FRS and the Sector to help improve performance.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1645848,Government first as London Assembly questions Bob Neill,"Local government minister Bob Neill has become the first minister to appear before London Assembly since its establishment a decade ago. 

Mr Neill was questioned by Assembly Members (AM) on a range of issues affecting the capital including the Government's priorities for London, plans for devolution, planning, scrutiny and accountability.

Mr Neill said:

> ""I was delighted to be the first minister to appear before the London Assembly - it's very important that we have a productive and open relationship as we drive more power down from Whitehall.
> 
> ""We've already begun the process of stripping power away from the centre to where it can make a real difference in London boroughs and beyond to the community itself.  It's an exciting time for London, and the Assembly will be at the heart of it.""

Chair of the Assembly Dee Doocey AM said:

> ""For the last decade ministers have declined invitations to appear in front of the Assembly in public. Bob Neill's attendance at today's Assembly meeting proved there is no reasonable impediment to ministers being open and frank with Londoners and their elected representative about government plans for the capital. I hope this welcome development marks fresh thinking in Whitehall and will be repeated by other ministers.""

Len Duvall AM, who seconded the motion said:

> ""Today's meeting was a reasonable, considered and above all useful discussion about how government in London may change. Bob Neill is to be congratulated for his commitment to engage with the Assembly on this important issue for the capital, not in a back room away from the public's gaze, but in an open meeting.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1800061,Government frees Stoke to take forward improvement locally,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill returned local leadership to Stoke today by dissolving the top-down governance board that has overseen the council since 2008.

A Transition Board for Stoke-on-Trent City Council was appointed by central Government in 2008 following the recommendation of an independent Commission to restore the 'broken politics' within the city. In 2009 this was reformed into a Governance and Transition Board with powers over service delivery.

In line with the new Government's localist agenda Mr Neill announced that the Government has reached agreement with the Council that this Board should now be closed following significant progress. The Minister believes local issues ultimately need transparent local solutions and not permanent top down monitoring.

The Board has advised that the political situation in Stoke has stabilised and the Council's relationships with local bodies, interaction with local people, and collaboration with neighbouring authorities, have all improved. Arrangements, relating to the Council's operation with regard to pay, allowances and scrutiny have also started to change.

Mr Neill said:

> ""I know the council let its residents down and has faced a number of challenges to its governance and service delivery in recent years, but we now agree it's time to return power to Stoke's elected officials. Local problems need local solutions and the people of Stoke need democratic and accountable leadership.
> 
> ""I want to thank the Board and its chair Professor Michael Clarke for their efforts in helping to return stability. Stoke's councillors now need to prove that they can take the city forward by working together to give local people the local services they deserve.""

In addition the Boundary Committee has recently published its final report on the ward boundaries. Its recommendations will lead to a smaller council with all, or predominantly, single member wards with all-out four-yearly elections. There will be elections in Stoke-on-Trent in May 2011 based on the new single member wards.

### Notes to editors

1. The Governance Commission appointed in 2007 made 14 recommendations to improve the City including a Transformation Board to monitor the progress against the other 13 recommendations. The Transition Board was reformed as the Governance and Performance Transition Board to address the slow rate of service improvement in 2009. The Governance and Performance Transition Board now considers that the changes the Council has made, or which are underway, have addressed the issues related to the Council's operation, eg pay, governance, overview and member development. The next scheduled meeting of the Board on 16 December will be the final meeting.

2. The Local Government Boundary Commission for England has recently undertaken a consultation on the size of the wards and the number of councillors per ward in Stoke-upon-Trent. This has resulted in a recommendation for 44 members rather than the current 60 and a system of predominantly single member wards although there would be five wards with two members and one with three. This was recommended by the Governance Commission. For more information: [http://www.lgbce.org.uk/news-and-media/latest-news/electoral-review/local-electoral-arrangements-for-stoke-on-trent-finalised](http://www.lgbce.org.uk/news-and-media/latest-news/electoral-review/local-electoral-arrangements-for-stoke-on-trent-finalised) (external link).

3. Service delivery has improved, albeit from a low baseline. The Governance and Performance Transition Board recommends that this issue can now be left to the Authority. Doing so will re-enforce the localism message. The Government Office has been involved in the Commission and Board since its inception in 2007. The officials in the GO share the opinion of the Chairman that the Board has done as much as it could and that its continuance would add little value to the development of good government within the City.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2111086,Government gives residents a real-terms Council Tax cut,"Residents and hard pressed families will get more help with their cost of living from the real terms council tax cut delivered by our freeze grant deal, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Official statistics published today reveal that the average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2012-13 will be £1444 - a 0.3 per cent change on last year.

Council tax bills more than doubled between 1997 and 2011. The majority of councils (358) have accepted the Government's grant offer by freezing or reducing their council tax levels in 2012-13.

This is the second year the Government has made funding available for a council tax freeze for local residents, families and pensioners. Last year's freeze saved households up to an estimated £72 on a Band D bill, and this year's freeze is potentially worth the same saving to residents.

Every household in London will benefit from an actual cash-terms cut in council tax. Ministers also praised over twenty authorities for cutting their council tax in cash-terms. They include Hammersmith and Fulham, the Greater London Authority South Oxfordshire, Stratford-on-Avon, Windsor and Maidenhead, Chorley and Brentwood.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles said:

> ""After years of hurt when council tax bills doubled - to around £120 a month - our action is putting residents first for a second consecutive year. The overwhelming majority of councils, 358, have taken up our funding deal to freeze council tax.
> 
> ""The average Band D change across England is a mere 0.3 per cent. This is a real terms cut in council tax and real help to hard-working families and pensioners with their cost of living expenses.""

### Notes to editors

1. The definitive National Statistics published today revealed that the average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2012-13 will be £1,444. In London it will be £1,304; in metropolitan areas £1,401; and in shire areas £1,492. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11 and remained at that level in 2011-12. The statistical release can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/counciltax201213](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/counciltax201213).

2. The 85 per cent of authorities that chose not to put up their council tax will now receive a grant worth between a 2.5 and 3 per cent increase on their 2011-12 Band D council tax. The final list of councils that have agreed to take part in the Government's 2012-13 council tax freeze initiative can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2110558.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2110558.xls) (Excel, 73kb).

3. Without the freeze grant offer local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could have faced increases of up to £72 in each of the two years of the council tax freeze schemes. The value of these saving for taxpayers by area compared to a five per cent rise can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls) (Excel, 63kb).

4. More details on how the council tax freeze scheme for 2012-13 works can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf) (PDF, 32kb).

5. Local authorities who do not put up their council tax will receive a grant worth between a 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent increase on their Band D council tax. The amount of grant authorities will receive for freezing or reducing their council tax in 2012-13 can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2111493.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2111493.xls) (Excel, 81.5kb)

6. The authorities cutting their council tax in cash-terms by more than 0.1 per cent for 2012-13 are:

  
  


7. The Localism Act abolished Whitehall capping in England and instead gives the public the right to approve or veto excessive council tax rises in a binding referendum. This new 'local tax lock' gave people a vote to stop council tax going up if their local authority sought to hike the tax above a ceiling approved by the House of Commons each year will automatically trigger a referendum of all registered local electors in their area. On 8 February 2012, the House endorsed a 3.5 per cent referendums threshold for most authorities. No local authorities have reported a triggered referendum this year, though a small number opted to set a level just below the threshold.

8. The Government's provisional funding settlement for English local authorities next financial year will mean councils have an average spending power of £2,186 per dwelling at their disposal. £27.8 billion will be distributed in 2012-13 in a fair and sustainable way across all parts of the country - rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. It will give more weight to areas with the highest levels of assessed need. For example, the average spending power per household in Hackney will be £3,050 compared with £1,537 in Windsor and Maidenhead reflecting the fairness of the settlement. Overall the average spending power reduction for councils in 2012-13 is expected to be limited to just 3.3 per cent or £75 per household, less than last year's comparable figure of 4.5 per cent.

9. Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home in the years up to 2010-11 before the freeze grant was offered. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double. Average Band D council tax and percentage change between 1993-94 and 2012-13 are shown below:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1744170,Government is tackling homelessness to stop the revolving door of reoffending,"The Government has today outlined plans to stop the revolving door that brings ex-offenders back into prison, and instead help them into stable new homes and new lives.

A third of people sleeping rough in London last year had spent some time in prison - with some even claiming to have re-offended in order to get back into prison and get a roof over their heads.

So Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Prisons Minister Crispin Blunt today confirmed that they will work with voluntary organisations including Crisis to offer a new scheme, in which ex-offenders and single homeless people will be given help to find and maintain a new home in the private rented sector.

Mr Blunt also said his officials will work with councils to improve access to housing advice in prisons. With a fifth of prisoners reporting on release that they have nowhere to stay, offering this kind of service could be key to stopping the revolving door which brings ex-offenders back into prison because they have nowhere else to go.

Plans could also include helping prisoners to set aside a proportion of their earnings to use for a deposit on a property when they are released.

Two thirds of ex-prisoners re-offend within two years of release. Getting ex-prisoners into stable homes could reduce re-offending rates by as much as a fifth.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""People can become homeless for a whole host of complex reasons - whether alcohol, drugs, losing a job or the breakdown of a relationship. But when a third of all rough sleepers have spent time in prison, this is one particular reason that needs our urgent attention.
> 
> ""No-one should be left in the position where they re-offend just to get a roof over their heads. That's why our new scheme to help homeless people into stable, private rented accommodation will also be on hand to help ex-prisoners.
> 
> ""Our new ministerial working group on homelessness, bringing eight ministers together from across Whitehall, means we as a Government are tackling the issues that affect homeless people in a coordinated way, and means we are able to come up with imaginative and innovative solutions.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2012247,Government moves ahead with plans to abolish regional plans and protect the green belt,"Pressure to build on the Green Belt is being removed with the revocation of Regional Plans according to environmental assessments published today.

The Coalition Government is committed, through the Localism Bill now passing through Parliament, to abolishing Regional Plans, which imposed housing targets on local communities and put pressure on councils to cut the Green Belt in 30 towns across the country.

The process of returning decision-making powers on housing and planning to local communities moved up a gear with the publication today of environmental assessments of the revocation of each Plan for consultation. The reports make it clear that revoking Regional Plans will mean there is less top down pressure on communities to review Green Belt.

Subject to Royal Assent of the Bill and the environmental assessments, the final abolition of each individual Regional Plan will be commenced after the assessment process has been completed.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""This Government is putting an end to unpopular, undemocratic Regional Plans, which imposed development on communities and threatened the countryside.
> 
> ""These reports make it clear that revoking the Plans will protect communities and the environment from top down pressure to build on the Green Belt.  
   
""We are putting planning powers into the hands of local people to take charge of local housing challenges in a way that makes sense for them while protecting the local countryside and green spaces they value.""

### Notes to editors

1. Regional Spatial Strategies were introduced in 2004 and provided binding planning frameworks including nationally set housing targets at a regional level. They were drawn up by regional planning bodies and councils had to prepare their ""Local Development Documents"", based on the Regional Spatial Strategy.

2. The Coalition Government is revoking these Regional Plans through the Localism Bill. We have undertaken voluntary assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the revocation of the eight existing Regional Plans. The assessments have been carried out in line with the procedure set out in the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive.

3. Eight Environmental Reports are being published on the Department's website today 20 October 2011, on which we are seeking comments from organisations and individuals. The period of consultation will be 12 weeks ending on 20 January 2012. Subject to the assessment process we expect the orders revoking the existing Regional Plans to take effect next Spring. The reports are available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningenvironment/strategicenvironmentassess](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningenvironment/strategicenvironmentassess/).

4. The abolition of Regional Plans provides a clear signal of the importance attached to the development and application of local plans. Local plans drawn up with the help of the community will become the basis for local planning decisions, and future reform will make it easier for local councils to agree and amend local plans with their local community, in a way that maximises the involvement of neighbourhoods. The Localism Bill will also introduce a duty to cooperate on local planning authorities, county councils and public bodies which will require them to engage constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis in the planning process.

5. Towns and areas that were planning Green Belt reviews because of Whitehall-imposed targets will now be able to make their own decisions where new development is built. They include: Bath, Bedworth, Bournemouth, Bristol, Bromsgrove, Broxbourne, Cheltenham, Chertsey, Coventry, Gloucester, Guildford, Harlow, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead, Leeds, Lichfield, Maidenhead, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Nottingham, Nuneaton, Oxford, Redditch, Redhill, Reigate, Rushcliffe, Stevenage, Solihull, Tunbridge Wells, Welwyn, and Woking and Worcester and in West Yorkshire beyond Leeds.

6. The Government is introducing a stronger locally-led planning system, where local communities decide where development goes and receive benefits from that development through the New Homes Bonus and Community Infrastructure Levy. Communities will also have the power to prevent encroachment on the Green Belt and will benefit from a new special protection for green spaces under the Localism Bill.

7. The draft National Planning Policy Framework also safeguards valued, national protection for our countryside including Green Belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest to protect them from encroachment.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2001979,"Government on track to provide land for 100,000 new homes","Housing Minister Grant Shapps today hailed the rapid progress of Government plans to release formerly-used public land with enough capacity to build up to 100,000 new homes by 2015.

In a major boost for housebuilding and Government transparency, departments with significant landholdings have published, for the first time, strategies that set out how their formerly-used land and property has the capacity to deliver more than 50,000 desperately-needed new homes.

Over the summer these departments have moved swiftly to identify land and property that could be released for new development. This builds on the 11,000 housing starts that will be achieved through the release of land owned by the Homes and Communities Agency. The amount of previously-developed land owned by the public sector is more than twice the size of Leicester, and its development could support as many as 200,000 construction and related jobs.

At the same time the Minister announced fresh steps to help communities across the country reclaim and develop hundreds of acres of unused public sector land and buildings, which could be used to deliver the schemes communities want to see in their areas.

Members of the public will now be able to request a sale of public land and buildings by filling in a simple and user friendly form. It will replace a system that is so obscure and restrictive that it has hardly ever been used, with only one successful application in the past 13 years.

The improved process for requesting the sale of public land and property will be one way of applying for land to be released by Government departments, and will also apply to land owned by councils and other public bodies.

Alongside a website that maps and provides details about public sector assets owned by councils and other public bodies, the new process to request the sale of disused land and buildings will form the bedrock of the Community Right to Reclaim Land.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Government is one of the country's biggest landlords, so at a time when we desperately need more homes, we have a critical role in making new sites available for developers and communities.
> 
> ""So I'm delighted that Government departments have quickly taken up the ambitious challenge to release land with capacity for over 50,000 new homes, and that property specialists will continue to work with these departments to make sure that no stone is left unturned. I will look to ensure that as much of this public land as possible is available under our innovative Build Now, Pay Later model - helping get developers on site and laying the foundations for these homes as quickly as possible.
> 
> ""I'm also pleased to announce that from today communities will have a new option to improve their local area by developing disused public land and buildings, instead of being forced to battle through a quagmire of bureaucratic obstruction and indifference.
> 
> ""Under our new Community Right to Reclaim Land, local people will now be able to see at the click of a button if disused land and property in their area is owned by a public body. And from today, ordinary people will have a simple system for making a case to use that land and improve their local area, with a promise they will now be listened to.""

The Minister will also look to extend the innovative Build Now, Pay Later model to as much formerly-used public land as possible - so developers and communities can get on the site and start building, paying for the land only after homes are built.

Property specialists will continue to work with each department and challenge them to release as much land as they can for new homes, and a Cabinet Committee will carefully analyse each department's plans to ensure every possible site is made available for housebuilding.

Earlier in the summer Mr Shapps outlined his own department's contribution, as the Homes and Communities Agency published its plans to release more land for redevelopment. This included a commitment to dispose of land using the Build Now, Pay Later model where appropriate, with housebuilders getting going without bearing the upfront cost of land - providing a lifeline to those struggling with cash flow problems, and enabling them to start building straight away.

The new Community Right to Reclaim Land will help communities to improve their local area by getting disused publicly owned land released for new development, and will revolutionise the way local people, working alone or with their communities, will be able to come together to build the homes, shops and businesses the area needs.

Under the improved system for requesting the sale of land, called the Public Request to Order Disposal, anyone can send a request to the Secretary of State setting out why they think:

  * land or property covered by the Request process is under-used or vacant

  * there are no suitable plans for the land, which have been consulted upon and publicly tested, in place or likely to be put in place in an acceptable period of time; and

  * why the land should be disposed of in order to enable it to be brought back into use.

Work is continuing to increase the number of organisations that are covered by the process for requesting sales of public land.

### Notes to editors

1. Four Government departments have today published their land disposal strategies, which set out how their formerly-used land and property has the capacity to deliver more than 50,000 new homes, putting the Government on track to release land with the capacity to build up to 100,000 new homes by 2015. This builds on the 11,000 homes that will be delivered by the Homes and Communities Agency's land release. Details were set out in the Homes and Communities Agency's development and land release strategy which was published on 8 June 2011.

2. Using previously-developed land owned by the public sector to deliver new homes could support as many as 200,000 construction and related jobs, 50,000 in every year of the spending review period. Disposal strategies published today include:

5. The Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 gives members of the public the power to request that empty public sector land owned by local authorities and a limited number of other public bodies is sold off. Regulations have been laid to enable this power to become a part of the Community Right to Reclaim Land. A dedicated page on the Department for Communities and Local Government's website, which includes the new request form and explains how members of the public citizens can use the system to submit a request, can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/righttoreclaim/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/righttoreclaim/).

6. Examples of disused public-sector land being used for development:

**The Bridge, Tunbridge Wells  
**This 1.86ha former rail goods yard site in Tunbridge Wells was owned by BRB (Residuary) Ltd and sold in three phases between 2006 and 2009 to Fairview New Homes Ltd. Along with other land next to the site, it has been re-developed for housing, and sits in a landscaped setting, with access to nearby shops and the railway station. In the first phase 52 private homes and 29 social homes have been built.

**Ruddington, Nottinghamshire  
**Bought by Crest Nicholson from the BRB (Residuary) Ltd in 2006, this 2.125ha former railway station sidings in Ruddington, Nottinghamshire has provided for around 60 housing units and sits in the heart of the village. It has been developed in keeping with the local characteristics and landscape of the area, and has delivered a mix of housing types, including coach houses, terraced and detached properties, along with social housing.

**Hooley Lane, Redhill  
**This development by Barratt Homes and George Wimpey Homes is on a 3.69ha former goods yard that was owned by BRB (Residuary) Ltd. The site has been re-developed for housing, providing 180 homes, 54 that are affordable, a community hall and open space. The design of buildings has been traditional in form and in keeping with the area, and has used different design styles and detailing.

**Boxgrove Gardens, Guildford  
** This former 4.92ha Defra site is in an area bordering the South Downs has been developed by Linden Homes for residential use, providing a new residential development of 200 homes in character with the local area, and protecting the local environment. These are of mixed size and tenure, integrating new and old development with the surrounding area, and including the restoration of the historic Uplands House, removing the 1950s extensions and restoring the property for residential use.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1923556,Government plans final steps to cancel backdated ports 'tax',"The proposed legal changes that will cancel the unfair, retrospective business rate payments on businesses, including those affected within ports, were published on the 14 June 2011, Local Government Minister Bob Neill has announced.

Many port-based companies faced backdated bills reaching into the millions after the Valuation Office Agency undertook a review of the rating of business properties within ports in 2008.

Today's publication of draft regulations set forth the Government's longheld commitment to find a permanent solution for businesses hit with these unexpected and significant backdated rates.

Ministers suspended collection of the retrospective business rate demands last year through emergency regulation, to give a lifeline to struggling firms in a difficult economic climate.

The draft regulations and guidance is to be made under the Localism Bill, which is currently progressing through Parliament. When the Bill is passed the final regulations will come into effect, permanently cancelling the backdated business rates liabilities altogether and lift the burden of debt off these businesses.

All eligible businesses across England faced with a similar backdated rates liability will benefit and not just businesses within ports.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""From day one, the Coalition Government has been committed to revoking the ports tax - these unfair backdated rates bills threatened the solvency of many port-based businesses across England.
> 
> ""We've already suspended collection of any of these unjust bills and the regulations published today lay out our permanent solution.
> 
> ""Once the Localism Bill receives Royal Assent, we can make the final regulation so that this heavy debt burden will finally be removed from the port businesses shoulders altogether, safeguarding vital jobs and businesses.""

The draft regulations and guidance published today set out who will qualify for the cancellation and how it will be implemented giving interested parties the opportunity to make any comments to ensure that the final version will fully implement the cancellation policy.

The cancellation policy will ensure local authorities can automatically cancel the qualifying backdated bills they are already aware of. Business Rate Demand Notices for 2012/13 will also include information on the cancellation so that ratepayers can contact their council if they believe they are eligible.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1917730,"Government plans release of public land to build 100,000 homes","Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced Government plans to release enough public land to build as many as 100,000 new, much-needed homes and support as many as 25,000 jobs by 2015.

The amount of previously-developed land owned by the public sector is more than twice the size of Leicester.

So the Minister today confirmed that by this Autumn, every Government department with significant landbanks will publish plans to release thousands of acres of previously-developed land to housebuilders, so they can get on and build the homes the country needs - supporting thousands of jobs and releasing funds to help in the vital work of bringing down the Budget deficit.

To make this radical ambition a reality by 2015 the Public Expenditure Committee, a Cabinet Committee chaired by Francis Maude, will go through each department's plans with a fine tooth comb, to make sure every possible site is made available for housebuilding.

Alongside this, property specialists from across Government will work with each department and challenge them to release as much land as they can for new homes.

Ministers are also encouraging councils to follow the lead set by central Government and make their unused land available for development.

Later this year, a new map will be launched to show land and buildings owned by public bodies in each area. A new Community Right to Reclaim Land has been introduced enabling residents to apply to organisations including central Government departments and councils to bring their sites back into use - opening up the books so local people can see for themselves the assets held by central and local Government alike.

Grant Shapps also outlined his own department's contribution, as the Homes and Communities Agency publishes its plans to release more land for redevelopment. This includes through a radical Build Now, Pay Later deal, which offers a boost to housebuilders who only pay for the land once work has started on the new homes - providing a lifeline to those struggling with cashflow problems, and enabling them to start building straight away.

Publicly owned sites such as the following have been, and are being, made available for new housing developments across the country:

  * **Fairmile, Oxfordshire** - A 40-hectare former hospital site owned by the Homes and Communities Agency, beside the river Thames in Cholsey, Oxfordshire. Fairmile is being transformed with the creation of 354 new homes including refurbished houses and apartments within the retained Grade II hospital buildings. There will be a mix of commercial, community and leisure facilities as well as landscaped grounds that will be made accessible to the public. The first new homes are due to be completed by developer Linden Homes this month and it is expected that the whole scheme will be complete by 2014. This will also serve as an early pilot for 'Build Now, Pay Later'.
  * **New Covent Garden Market** - a 57 acre site, in Vauxhall, South London, will be redeveloped at no cost to tax payers to provide a new modern market, 2300 apartments, a hotel, shops, a major grocery store and community facilities including a food industry training suite. The market hosts 200 businesses with more than 2500 people employed on the site, the largest single employment site in Wandsworth. New Covent Garden Market is part of the Nine Elms Opportunity area which includes Battersea Power Station and the future home of the American Embassy. To provide additional transport links for the area, which when completed will include 16,000 homes including affordable housing, the developers are funding London Underground's Northern Line Extension. Covent Garden Market's redevelopment project includes the start of the new Green Linear park which will link the Nine Elms Opportunity area and provide additional outdoor and community space for Londoners and visitors; and
  * **Bath** - The rationalisation of office accommodation owned by the Ministry of Defence will free up sites in Bath, which will be brought forward for disposal over the next few years. Subject to planning, the sites have the potential for around 1000 new homes. Bath and North East Somerset's Core Strategy is going to Enquiry in Public in September 2011 and it is anticipated that the Inspector's report is due in spring 2012.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""As one of the country's biggest landlords, the Government has a critical role to play in making sites available for developers so we can get the homes this country needs built.
> 
> ""So today, I can confirm an ambitious challenge across Government to release enough land from Whitehall's grip for 100,000 new homes across the country. Over the coming months, property specialists will work to make sure no stone is left unturned and no site is left unused, and every department's plans will come under the close scrutiny of a Cabinet committee.
> 
> ""The work starts today, with sites already being brought forward by three different departments, including my own, some of which will be available on new terms so developers can start building straight away. So we are already off to a flying start - it is now for developers to come forward, make the most of this unique opportunity, and help contribute to our country-wide efforts to help get the homes this country needs built.""

Chief Secretary to Treasury Danny Alexander said:

> ""This is a double dose of good news, creating and sustaining thousands of jobs by boosting housebuilders while also creating thousands of new homes for people to live in. Getting the economy growing is the Government's top priority and this move, combined with other measures set out in the Plan for Growth to ease planning restrictions, are a key part of helping the private sector led recovery.""

Mark Clare, Chief Executive of Barratt Developments PLC, said:

> ""This is a big step in the right direction. The rapid release of publicly owned land has the potential to be an effective catalyst for increasing the supply of land for new homes in this country during the next few years.""
> 
> ""Barratt has an established track record of working with public sector partners to build out important sites and deliver desperately needed new homes. We are already working on a number of Build Now Pay Later sites with the public sector and, in the wake of today's announcement, will be looking at ways to expand and deepen that partnership.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1774786,Government publishes report on drying out flooded houses,"A report into the drying out of houses to help people get back in to their homes more quickly has been published.

The report has been urgently published by Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and it is hoped that this will help to provide advice to the people in Cornwall who have just experienced flooding of their homes.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The recent floods in Cornwall have been terrible for many people and families who have had to leave their homes. The Government wants to do everything possible to help people get back into their homes as quickly as possible.""

Issues such as a shortage of competent damage management contractors including specialist drying firms are key to re-occupation when there has been widespread flooding.

The research report identifies the stages of the drying process and finds that:

  * there is much guidance freely available on the drying of flooded buildings;
  * the issues that need to be considered include health issues for both workmen and residents;
  * drying times vary from three weeks to over a year and are affected by the building's construction materials, the ambient atmosphere as well as the type of drying method chosen;
  * it must be recognised that each property needs to be considered on an individual basis and that it is not a case of a 'one size fits all' solution;
  * local authorities also have a significant role either because they are the property owner, or in the case of private dwellings through their inspection function; and
  * there may be a need for better communication between the various organisations and the householder.

The research was carried out for the Government by a consortium of the Construction Industry Research and Information Association, the University of Wolverhampton, and HR Wallingford researchers. The report was commissioned following summer floods of 2007 and subsequent Pitt Review. The report _Guidance and standards for drying flood damaged buildings_ is published on the Department for Communities and Local Government website (see link, top right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/2056346,Government response to select committee report on the draft National Planning Policy Framework,"Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today welcomed a Select Committee report that showed people supported the concept of a streamlined planning system.

The Committee concluded that ""we can report that most witnesses to our inquiry were broadly content with the concept and approach of the NPPF in simplifying planning guidance and did not want a wholesale rewrite."" (p7)

In particular, the Committee considered that ""it is reasonable and practical for the NPPF to have as an overarching principle a presumption in favour of sustainable development."" (p32)

And indeed that ""if the final NPPF contains an agreed definition of sustainable development which is balanced and comprehensive, then the 'presumption in favour of sustainable development' becomes a very constructive part of the Government's wider environmental, social and economic agendas."" (p22)

The Committee helpfully provides its own suggested definition of sustainable development (p28) which it considers would achieve this purpose.

It is a definition that respects the core Brundtland definition but reflects the balance between economic, social and environmental dimensions. The Government will carefully consider the proposed approach.

Mr Clark said:

> ""I warmly welcome the DCLG select committee's constructive recommendations to the draft Framework consultation. I invited the Committee to make specific suggestions to the draft framework and am grateful for the practical and measured way they have approached the exercise.
> 
> ""The Government will consider carefully each of the suggestions that have been made, along with all responses to the consultation.
> 
> ""We are determined that the National Planning Policy Framework will put power into the hands of local people, through a simpler, clearer system, which safeguards our natural and historic environment while allowing the jobs and homes to be created that our country needs.""

The Committee's report establishes common ground with the Government that:

  * The planning system needs to be simpler and more accessible (p63)
  * The local plan is the starting point for decisions (p4)
  * The current absence of plans has been a contributory factor to the shortage of homes (p48)
  * That a 'presumption in favour of sustainable development' should be a golden thread running through the planning system (Press release)
  * The definition of sustainable development should be based on the longstanding Brundtland definition (p24)
  * Local Authorities should be incentivised to have plans in place as soon as possible (pg 41- 42)
  * Transition arrangements should be established in consultation with local government (p53)

The report makes specific constructive suggestions including:

  * An expanded definition of sustainable development (p28)
  * Standardising key terms - such as weight in decision making (p15)
  * Emphasising the importance of the local plan (p34)
  * Clarifying the expression of policy on brownfield land, offices in town centres and windfall sites (p57-60)

It is vital that in the aftermath of such serious and shocking disturbances we work to establish the deeper rooted causes behind the criminality. This is a thorough attempt to do that and I thank the Panel members for their work. We will look seriously at their findings and respond on those actions aimed at Government in due course. Many of the recommendations in the report are aimed at communities, local government, schools and the police and we would urge them to look carefully at the report.
> 
> ""Just as the Panel has established that there was no single cause of the riots, it is clear that there can be no single solution. But many of the recommendations in the report chime with this Government's clear ambition to give power back to communities, reform and join up public services and extend opportunities for young people.
> 
> ""My own Department's Troubled Families programme will tackle some of the most entrenched social problems in our country by getting members of 120,000 families off the streets, back into school and on a pathway to work. This Government has also embarked on radical reforms of welfare, education and criminal justice which are all aimed at addressing some of the deep-seated challenges facing some sections of society which are highlighted in the report. This includes action to reduce truancy; support for the important role that fathers play; and piloting changes in the criminal justice system to incentivise reductions in re-offending.
> 
> ""And of course we should not forget that the strength of our communities was shown not by the actions of a criminal few determined to wreak havoc but by the actions of the majority of local people who pulled together in the aftermath, cleaned up the mess and supported their neighbours to restore pride in the places they call home.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1611369,Government sets out further detail on local government savings,"The Government has today published details of the £1.166bn Local Government contribution to the £6.2bn cross government savings in 2010/11. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has confirmed that no local authority will face reductions in their revenue grant of more than 2 per cent.

The £6.2bn savings represent the first step in the Government's efforts to tackle an unprecedented £156 billion deficit inherited from the previous government in order to restore confidence in our economy and support the recovery.

Unless borrowing is reduced, interest on Government debt will hit £70 billion a year by 2014-15. This is more than is currently raised from council tax, business rates, stamp duty and inheritance tax combined.

Ministers have given careful consideration to how savings can be found without affecting the quality of key frontline services. The priority has been on driving out Whitehall waste with the brunt of the cuts being borne at the centre.

  * Communities and Local Government has been asked to find £780m savings in 2010/11. Departmental and Arms Length Body running costs are therefore being reduced by 10 per cent.

The need to act quickly to reduce the deficit means that Government departments have had to make difficult decisions about reducing grants to local government. Shielding the frontline has underpinned decisions on where savings can be found.

  * The £29bn general grant, the main source of funding that local government receives every year, is not being reduced. This will ensure that key frontline services can be protected and prevent council tax rises.
  * Local Government is being asked to contribute £1.166bn to overall savings. No individual local authority will face a reduction in their revenue grant of more than 2 per cent.

Government is reducing the management burden of authorities and giving councils the extra flexibility they need to concentrate on local priorities and protect the frontline.

  * Reduction in revenue and capital non-schools ring-fencing this year from 10.7 per cent (£4.5bn) to only 7.7 per cent (£3.2bn) as a first step to giving councils more freedom over spending decisions. In addition, a major scaling back of quangos puts local government centre stage in meeting the needs of local residents.

All councils will, by January 2011, be publishing online details of their spending over £500. This will mean local taxpayers will be able to see how councils are spending money-helping protect frontline services, encouraging greater efficiency and shining a spotlight on waste.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles:

> ""The nation's deficit is running at £156bn. Reducing that deficit, putting the finances back on a stable footing and continuing to ensure economic recovery is the most urgent issue facing Britain. Tough fiscal times will be challenging for all, but the reductions have been made to reflect the Government's policy of decentralisation and a scaling back of the quango state.
> 
> ""The detailed spending decisions outlined today show a clear determination to make the necessary savings whilst minimising the impact on essential frontline services like rubbish collections and protecting spending on schools and Sure Start. We have focused attention on reducing the centre and it is here that the reductions are the hardest.
> 
> ""Steps have been taken to limit the impact on local authorities and make savings proportionally. Councils have been given the flexibility they need to determine where they make savings. We are clear that no extra burden must fall on local taxpayers. We are committed to freezing council tax in England for at least one year, and seek to freeze it for a further year, in partnership with local authorities.""

The details being published today will enable local government to get on with the work of managing their budgets effectively.

The Government recognises that it will be challenging for local authorities to make in-year savings, as it is for other parts of the public sector. But Ministers are clear that delaying the cuts now will simply compound the impact on authorities for the future. For all grant streams the Government is satisfied that it has adopted a fair approach to making the necessary reductions.

### Notes to editors

1. Local Government will make a contribution of £1.166bn towards the overall saving of £6.2bn across Government in 2010-11 through reductions in individual grants to Local Authorities. This is made up of:

  
  


1 _Includes £4.9m of DWP funding for WNF  
_ 2 _Includes £4.9m of DWP funding for WNF_

2. The CLG grants above, total £353.5m (excluding those on Local Government DEL), and are part of the £780m in year savings to be made by CLG. The other CLG programmes which make up this £780m reduction are set out in the following table.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1604290,Government sets out proposals to turn around failing Doncaster Council,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today announced a package of measures to turn around Doncaster Council, following an Audit Commission report that the Council is not properly run, is failing, and lacks the capacity to improve.

### New Leadership

Draft proposals include the appointment of new Chief Executive and a team of Commissioners to ensure Doncaster has the experienced leadership and expert support it needs to make radical improvements.

In April this year the Audit Commission's inspection found the Council was failing Doncaster people highlighting numerous longstanding problems that they did not have the capacity or capability to fix. The main issues included:

  * **Failing local services:** The tragic events of the Edlington case is the latest in a series of failures to keep children safe; housing services are poor with a high level of empty homes; provision for vulnerable groups is poor and over half of all homes failed to meet basic decency standards.
  * **Dysfunctional politics:** Councillors place politics and ongoing personal antagonisms above the Doncaster people; the Mayor and Cabinet show a lack of effective leadership; and officers are fail to act as a corporate team;
  * **Underperforming economy:** Doncaster lags well behind the national average on economic performance; an independent measure of UK local area competitiveness ranked Doncaster 355th out of 380 this year.
  * **Poor decision making:** Key decisions relating to schools, housing, health and economic development have been delayed due to political infighting, risking squandering funding programmes and depriving the town of vital investment.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""After 15 years of failure Doncaster people need to be properly served by their council. The dysfunctional politics, poor services and ineffective leadership, identified by the Audit Commission, all must be addressed.
> 
> ""All parties have agreed that intervention is needed and the package of measures we're announcing today will ensure that Doncaster gets the proper leadership and expertise that is urgently required for turning this situation around.
> 
> ""We are taking these actions to ensure that a well run Doncaster Council starts to prioritise the local people it's accountable to by creating the better, more efficient local services they're entitled to.""

### A New Approach

The Government is setting out the approach to address these failures. The actions set out today will ensure that the Council invests in the functioning and decisive governance Doncaster needs so the authority's £450m revenue budget is used effectively and efficiently on better public services.

Measures announced today would:

  * Establish a team of well respected Commissioners with powers to appoint, discipline or dismiss officers  and ensure council decision makers do not fail to act or act against the advice of their statutory officers.
  * Establish a non-executive Intervention and Recovery Board to support, challenge and monitor progress delivery, alongside the Commissioners, reporting to the Secretary of State as necessary.
  * Establish an experienced team of senior officers. The current Chief Executive of Kirklees Council Rob Vincent will be appointed as the new Chief Executive of Doncaster Council who will oversee the appointment of other key officers and secure value for money from its £450m revenue budget.

The Council now have time to discuss and agree the proposals before a final statutory order is introduced.

The Government expects the intervention programmes to be publicly available so people can see for themselves what improvements are being made.

Baroness Eaton, Chairman of the Local Government Association said:

> ""The LGA Group is committed to ensuring that local government meets the highest expectations of the people it serves. Experienced elected members and senior officers have been providing support to Doncaster MBC and the LGA's Deputy Chief Executive, Jo Miller, has been seconded in recent weeks as Acting Chief Executive.
> 
> ""The exceptional circumstances described in the Audit Commission's Corporate Governance Inspection means that statutory intervention by Government is required. The LGA group will contribute to the improvement and recovery effort at Doncaster Council to ensure success.""

New Chief Executive Rob Vincent said:

> ""I am looking forward to committing myself to helping Doncaster re-find its stride and make the progress that all who know the town are looking for. I know that it is a place with a great history, some current strengths, and good prospects. It has had many problems over a number of years, and there will be difficulties in finding a confident way forward. But it is clear that many individuals, officers and politicians, remain highly committed and motivated to achieve the best for local people. I will be pleased to join them, and to help shape a successful Doncaster for the future.""

Three sets of regulations and orders covering tree preservation orders in England will be streamlined into one document, saving local councils more then £500,000 in administration costs each year.

The new regulations will reduce paperwork, simplify the process of protecting trees and provide a fairer, more straightforward and effective system for tree preservation.

Bob Neill said:

> ""It's ridiculous we have three sets of regulations governing tree protection. Who knows how many trees have been felled to write all of these.
> 
> ""These regulations are exactly the sort of unnecessary paperwork we can easily trim down to a much more manageable size. Laws are supposed to protect people and their surroundings, not bury them in red tape.""

Tree preservation orders are made by local planning authorities and make it an offence to cut down, top or damage a protected tree without the authority's permission. They are important because they safeguard trees that make a significant impact on their local surroundings.

A 12 week consultation on the new regulations begins today. Further details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/treestreamliningconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/treestreamliningconsult).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1896918,Government to fund housing advice service for older people,"Making decisions to move home or change utility provider can be hard work and for some older people it can simply be too much. The different processes, prices, range of suppliers, can be daunting when on your own, have not done it for years, or on a limited income, so that not making expensive mistakes is even more important.

The place to get assistance may be FirstStop.

FirstStop is a free, independent, information and advice service for older people, their families and carers, and aims to help older people make informed decisions about their housing options and support, and to help them maintain independent living in later life. The service is provided through a dedicated telephone line and website. After two years of operation FirstStop is delivering information to increasing numbers - currently 130,000 in a year - of older people and families.

As part of the Coalition Government's commitment to help protect older and vulnerable people, the Department for Communities and Local Government has today confirmed funding of £1.5m over two years in 2011-12 and 2012-13 for FirstStop.

Announcing funding for First Stop, Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""As we all get older, we still want to retain our independence and our home and it is one of the Coalition Government's aims to enable people to do this.
> 
> ""But we all know that housing choices in later life are often complex and so the Government is helping by supporting the provision of information and advice from those best able to provide it. That is why today I am announcing the £1.5m funding for First Stop.""

One of the people whom First Stop has helped is Stourport resident Susan Albert.

Living in a crumbling home was the situation of 64 year-old Susan Albert in Stourport. She had no working cooking or bathing facilities and only one coal fire providing the heat. Mrs Albert had lived there for 30 years, but was now sleeping on the sofa downstairs and eating all her meals at the local cafe, or relying on cuppa-soups. Widowed a year earlier, and not in good health, she was now on her own as her two children had long ago moved away from the area and were not able to help her.

![Susan Albert](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1896944)

Fortunately a friend thinking that a home improvement loan might help approached the local Care and Repair Agency, who put her in touch with First Stop.

FirstStop Advice worker Elisa Steery* set up a meeting with Susan Albert at the local cafe, and they talked about what Susan would really like to do about her home and started to explore her options. Mrs Albert explained that she would prefer to downsize to live in a more manageable modernised property. Coping with the building works that her home clearly needed would be hard for her to do.

Elisa helped her to organise a survey on her home, which revealed that it failed on all four counts of the Decent Homes Standard. As a result Mrs Albert joined the local choice-based lettings scheme in a priority band.

Working with the local housing association, Elisa helped Mrs Albert bid for ground floor flats in the area as they became available. Elisa also turned ""Sherlock Holmes"" to find the deeds to the family home, and then helped get it to auction via a local estate agent. Once Mrs Albert's old property has been sold at auction, Elisa will organise for a FirstStop financial adviser to visit to discuss the best options for investing her capital.

Mrs Albert has now moved to a ground floor apartment with a level access shower, in a good location with easy access to shops and a GP surgery. Elisa has ensured that Susan Albert is getting all the social support benefits to which she is entitled and helped her to organise changes of address and swap accounts for gas and electric.

![Susan Albert](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1897508)

Using the Government funds FirstStop will develop sustainable revenue streams and achieve independence from public funding. It will continue to develop partnerships with local authorities, charities and home improvement agencies, to offer an integrated casework service 'support to move' (often called downsizing) service to more vulnerable clients, and to provide a phone support service for clients who can be helped without this more intensive face-to-face support. It will also continue to train housing and other professionals to offer integrated housing, care and finance advice to older people, their families and carers; and to develop peer-to-peer advice skills among older volunteers through, for examples, partnerships with local older people's forums.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1756638,Government wants new generation of social housing entrepreneurs,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today urged councils and housing associations to help unlock their tenants' entrepreneurial talents and allow them to set up businesses from their homes.

Research has suggested that as many as 96 per cent of housing associations can require tenants to get written permission to be able to work from home - with many tenants believing that permission would be denied.

While 11 per cent of homeowners work mainly from home, the figure can be as low as five per cent of council tenants.

Of the 200,000 small businesses operating from home only 22,000 of these are in council or housing association properties. This means that only 11 per cent of small businesses in the 1,000 most socially deprived areas operate from home - compared to 36 per cent in the rest of the country.

Mr Shapps today said that he wants social tenants to have the same opportunities as everyone else to set up their own businesses - so he urged landlords to use their common sense and, wherever possible, give the green light for residents to work from home.

Rather than waiting for tenants to come forward and ask permission, the Minister also called on councils and housing associations to make the first move and make clear to their tenants that they are pro-business - meaning there should be a presumption in favour of being able to run a business from a social home.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""I want all social tenants with the ambition, drive and vision to set up their own businesses to be given all the help they need to do so. But on far too many occasions their efforts are thwarted at the first hurdle. Without the money to get their own new premises, tenants too often feel unable to get their projects off the ground in their own homes as any homeowner would normally do.
> 
> ""Tenants should have the same opportunities as anyone else, and landlords have the key to unlocking this untapped entrepreneurial talent. I want them to get the message out loud and clear to their residents that wherever possible, and in the majority of cases, they will be able to set up and run their new businesses from home.
> 
> ""Of course, councils and housing associations must consider the possible impact on neighbours that a new company in the area could make. But I urge them to use their common sense and, where a tenant is making a reasonable request to start their career at home, that it be granted.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1837512,Government wins appeal on Regional Strategies,"The Coalition Government's intended abolition of Regional Strategies can be taken into account when making planning decisions, the High Court agreed today.

The judgment - in a High Court case brought by CALA Homes - confirms that the intended scrapping of Regional Strategies is a 'material consideration' which can be considered by local planning authorities and planning inspectors when making decisions.

The Government has long announced its intention to abolish the strategies through the Localism Bill, which received its Second Reading on 17 January 2011 in the House of Commons and is currently in Committee stage.

Planning Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""We are determined to return decision-making powers to communities and provide powerful incentives so people can see the benefits of building more homes, and the Bill will help achieve this.
> 
> ""This judgment makes it clear that planners can take into account the Government's intention to do away with Regional Strategies.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government made a firm pledge to sweep away these controversial strategies that have proved that top-down targets do not build homes. All they have produced is the lowest peacetime house building rates since 1924 and fuelled resentment in the planning process that has slowed everything down.""

The New Homes Bonus Scheme will provide cash for communities that allow new homes to be built in their area. The Community Infrastructure Levy will also provide cash to be spent on local infrastructure.

### Notes to editors

1. Regional Strategies were revoked on 6 July 2010 but were re-established on 10 November 2010 after a successful challenge by housing developer CALA Homes.

2. A subsequent challenge by CALA Homes, to halt planners using the intended revocation of the strategies as a 'material consideration' when making planning decisions, has been lost by the developer.

3. The judicial review, bought by CALA Homes, was heard at the High Court in London.

4. Pending abolition regional strategies remain part of the statutory development plan. The weight given to any 'material consideration' depends on the individual circumstances and it is for the decision maker to decide on the appropriate weight.

5. This latest judgement will not affect decisions already made on planning applications.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1912896,Government wins second legal challenge on Regional Strategies,"Planning authorities and inspectors can take the Coalition Government's intention to abolish Regional Strategies into consideration in deciding planning applications and appeals, the Court of Appeal has confirmed today.

For the second time, the courts have ruled in the Government's favour, following an appeal by CALA Homes arguing that the Government's intention to abolish the strategies could not lawfully be taken into account in any way in relation to planning applications and appeals, at least until such time as the Localism Bill becomes law.

CALA Homes lost an earlier challenge in the High Court and have lost their subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal.

The judgment means that the proposed abolition of the strategies can be regarded as a 'material consideration' by local planning authorities and inspectors when deciding planning applications and appeals. The Court has given helpful guidance to such decision makers on the approach they should take in judging the potential significance of that factor.

The Government announced its intention to abolish Regional Strategies through the Localism Bill last year. The Bill has now completed the Commons stage.

Planning Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""This judgment confirms that decision makers can take into account the Government's intention to sweep away Regional Strategies when deciding planning applications and appeals. I welcome the helpful guidance given in the judgment on the approach which local planning authorities and inspectors should follow in such decisions. Under the previous government's top-down targets we saw the lowest peacetime housebuilding rates since 1924.

> ""Increasing the rate of housebuilding is a top priority for the Government and is backed by incentives to kick-start building. Housebuilding has started to rise again and we recently paid the first cash payments under the New Homes Bonus. You don't need bureaucratic Regional Strategies to build more homes and support growth.""

The Localism Bill will introduce new incentives for communities that support local development, including the New Homes Bonus and a reformed Community Infrastructure Levy which both provide cash for communities to invest in local infrastructure and facilities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1609085,Government will overhaul unfair council house finance system,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today said that the Government is committed to giving councils more financial freedom to deliver a better deal for the 4 million people living in council housing.

Describing the current system of council house finance as a mess Mr Shapps said the Coalition Government would review the unfair Housing Revenue Account subsidy system. The Minister said he wanted to see a more transparent system that devolved more power to councils to better meet the housing needs of the communities they serve.

As a first step he pledged to continue the consultation on changes to a self-financing system already under way and urged councils and other partners to respond to this so he could get a comprehensive assessment of the options currently on the table. Following thorough analysis of responses the Minister will then announce whether the current proposal will be taken forward in part or in full, or whether an alternative model will be considered.

The current consultation on changes to the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system proposes replacing it with a new self-financing model where councils keep all the rent they collect from their homes and all receipts from any sales of houses or land. In return councils would take on some additional housing debt.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The council house finance system is a mess. For far too many years this unfair system has tied the hands of councils, stopping them from best meeting the housing needs of the communities they serve.
> 
> ""The 4 million tenants living in council housing deserve better. That's why this Coalition Government is committed to genuine action to overhaul the system. As a starting point I can today confirm that I am continuing the consultation on dismantling the current system that is already underway.
> 
> ""I want to see a new devolved system that puts councils firmly in control and gives them the financial freedom they need to make the best long terms decisions about their housing. But it is important I hear from councils and other experts themselves that the current proposal genuinely allows them to do this. And in these tough economic times I need to be convinced this approach offers the best possible value for money.
> 
> ""So I encourage everyone to use the remaining four weeks of the consultation to send me their views. Once I have considered these I will announce the next steps to return power and money to councils and communities themselves.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1831673,New financial deal for council housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has fired the starting gun on a council housing revolution that for the first time puts councils and communities in control - allowing them to make long term plans to offer a better deal to England's four million council tenants.

Under this new localist approach councils will have the tools and incentives to more effectively manage their housing stock over the long term, they will be free to make their own decisions about housing assets and through greater transparency tenants and local taxpayers will be better placed to hold their landlord to account.

The Minister today published details of the new financial deal for council housing - a key measure of the Localism Bill currently before Parliament. This includes a detailed description of how each council's opening financial position will be determined and the process for implementing these reforms in April 2012. By providing councils with clarity on funding for the future they can now begin detailed preparations on how they plan to better meet the housing needs of their communities over the long term.

This new approach, developed in partnership with local government, will bring an end to the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system where councils were required to pay council rents to Whitehall which decided how to redistribute it meaning they had no certainty about future income, no ability to plan long term and little incentive to be more efficient.

The new self-financing approach puts councils firmly in control with the tools and incentives they need to manage their housing stock over the long term rather than on a year by year basis. This will be achieved by a one-off adjustment to each council's housing debt after which councils will retain all the rental income they collect. And they will be free to make decisions about their housing assets without first having to get permission from Ministers in Whitehall.

By introducing a direct link between rents councils charge, the money they spend and the services they deliver tenants and local tax payers will be better able to hold their landlords to account. Councils will now for the first time be able to make information about how money is raised and spent publicly available in an easily accessible format. This will include how landlords are improving value for money to their tenants and local tax payers.

The deal includes an extra half a billion per year for councils to spend on their housing stock and extra £116 million funding for councils to pay for disabled adaptations to homes. In total, funding for management, maintenance, repairs and adaptations under the new approach will be 14 per cent higher than under the current subsidy system.

The Localism Bill, that begins its Committee Stage in the House of Commons today, 1 February 2011, includes these measures to repeal the existing subsidy system and replace it with powers for the Secretary of State to introduce self-financing.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""This deal brings to an end a centralised system which meant councils didn't know what funding they would get for housing from one year to the next and were unable to take key decisions about their housing stock. It prevented them from delivering the best possible services for their tenants in the most efficient way.
> 
> ""I am setting councils free to better meet the needs of their tenants. Today I am outlining these new freedoms as well as how each council's opening financial position will be calculated. By giving them clarity on their future revenue and the freedom they have to decide what is best in their local area they can now start preparing for this council house revolution that will begin next year. They now have the tools and incentives to radically overhaul the housing services they provide and deliver better value for money.
> 
> ""And by putting councils in control and making the decisions they take more transparent tenants and local tax payers will be better placed to hold their landlords to account.""

### Notes for editors

#### Introduction

The department has published a policy document on the future financial arrangements for council housing entitled 'Implementing Self-financing'. This is accompanied by:

i. A model which applies the settlement methodology to local authority data to provide indicative figures per council  
ii. A user guide to accompany this model  
iii. A report on the model inputs, assumptions and outputs

These reforms only have implications for each stock-retaining local authority's ring-fenced Housing Revenue Account, and will not impact on their general finances, or on other local authorities. Chapter 5 of 'Implementing Self-financing' has more information on the arrangements which keep money for housing separate from money spent on other services.

Abolition of the subsidy system does not end the requirement for local authorities to maintain a statutory, ring-fenced Housing Revenue Account. Local authorities will still be required to account to their tenants for income from and expenditure to council housing separately from income and spending on other functions and services. This ensures that council taxpayers do not subsidise services specifically for the benefit of tenants and that rent is not used to subsidise functions which are for the benefit of the wider local community.

#### The overall methodology

Valuations will be based on assumptions about each local authority's income and need to spend over 30 years. Assumptions about income will follow from the Government's social rent policy. The assumptions about expenditure needs will reflect evidence commissioned by Government in 2009 and 2010 about the costs of managing, maintaining and repairing the stock. This 30-year cash flow of income and expenditure will then be converted into a capital sum using standard discounted cash flow techniques.

The self-financing valuation will assume that local authorities will follow national social rent policy, which comprises a number of different components:

(i) A 'formula rent' for each property, based on property values, property size and local earnings. Over time, all social landlords are expected to move their rents in line with this formula. At present most housing associations set rents at or close to the formula level, but council rents were on average approximately 8 per cent below this in 2010/11.

(ii) A 'guideline rent' which converges with the formula rent by 2015/16. The valuation will assume convergence with formula rents by 2015/16, followed by rental increase of just above inflation year on year - set at the Retail Price Index + 0.5 per cent per annum.

(iii) A limit on individual rent rises of RPI + 0.5 per cent + £2 each year. This cap prevents excessively high increases in the rents of individual properties as they are moved over time to the formula rent. An estimate will be made for each landlord about the number of tenants whose rents could not move to the formula by 2015/16 without breaching this element of rent policy. The assumed income in the valuation will be reduced by this amount.

The spending needs built into the valuation are based on independent research about actual unit costs (by BRE, HQN and PwC) which are significantly higher than those under the present subsidy system. This approach to costs will give all local authorities more money to spend on managing, maintaining and repairing their stock than under the current system. In aggregate this works out at an increase to £545 million per year for 30 years or a national average Major Repairs Allowance of £956 per dwelling per year and average management and maintenance allowances of £2,061 per dwelling per year.

The assumed rents and costs will be used to produce a notional 30 year business plan of income and expenditure for each local authority landlord's business. This will be converted into a stock valuation using standard discounted cash flow principles, using a 6.5 per cent discount rate.

In order to calculate the payment to or from Government, the valuation will be compared with the notional amount of housing debt supported by Housing Revenue Account subsidy. If the valuation is higher than this assumed debt figure, the local authority will be required to pay Government the difference. If the valuation is lower, the Government will pay the difference to the local authority. Payments from central Government will in most cases not go to local authorities directly, but will be used to redeem debt held by the local authority.

#### The key figure

The key national figures are:

  * the estimated aggregate value of local authorities' housing businesses in 2012 at a discount rate of 6.5 per cent is £28.138 billion
  * the forecast for national Housing Revenue Account debt at April 2012 is £21,428 billion
  * the forecast receipt to the Exchequer is £6.711 billion.

For more information on these national figures including how the valuation, debt levels and receipt have altered since the figures published in March 2010 consultation see Annex A of 'Implementing Self-financing'.

#### The existing system

The existing subsidy system will continue unchanged for 2011/12.  Arrangements for this year are contained in 'Implementing Self-financing'.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1840154,No room for complacency despite fall in the number of home repossessions,"New figures today from the Council of Mortgage Lenders have shown a three-year low in the number of repossessions.

These figures show that repossessions in the last three months of 2010 were down by 11 per cent compared to the previous quarter, and 24 per cent less than the same period in 2009. The total number of repossessions in 2010 was 36,300 - 16,700 fewer than the 53,000 originally forecast.

Mr Shapps said that the fall in the number of people losing their homes through repossession action was a step in the right direction, but emphasised that there is no room for complacency and work must continue to support people at risk of losing their home.

He said that the Government's ongoing efforts to tackle the record deficit it had inherited must continue in order to avoid rapid increases in interest rates, which would put further pressure on already-stretched family budgets.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The fall in repossessions is welcome, but I am concerned that too many people are still worrying about losing their homes without seeking support.
> 
> ""I urge anyone who thinks they may be at risk of losing their home to take action immediately. There is help available and repossession should only ever be the very last resort. No one in financial difficulty should be embarrassed to seek help if they need it and worried homeowners should speak to their mortgage lender immediately. They can also visit the Directgov website for help to prepare a personal action plan, or seek expert advice from Shelter, National Debtline or the local Citizens Advice Bureau or local authority.
> 
> ""There are challenges ahead for homeowners in 2011 - so the most important thing that Government can do to keep repossessions as low as possible is to continue our efforts to tackle the record deficit. By doing this we can avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates, and keep the pressure off homeowners facing financial hardship.""

The most effective thing anyone with money worries can do is to seek early advice and speak to their lender to avoid losing their home.

Latest figures also published today show that one of the schemes aimed at helping the most vulnerable homeowners, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme, has helped 4,247 households receive help and advice from their local authority in the last quarter, with 2,015 homeowners having completed the full process since the scheme's launch in January 2009.

Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that claims leading to a court order have fallen over the last three months of 2010 by eight per cent compared to the same period in 2009, and claims for mortgage possession by lenders between October and December 2010 were two per cent lower than during the same period of 2009. Of the mortgage possession claims that led to orders, 48 per cent were suspended.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1751441,Grant Shapps announces package of measures to protect the vulnerable,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today outlined how the most vulnerable in society will be protected as the Government takes steps to tackle the record deficit.

The Minister confirmed £10 million funding this financial year for local authorities in London to help those households that are affected by the proposed Housing Benefit reforms. Funding may be used to provide financial advice, renegotiating rents and where necessary helping people move to more affordable accommodation. £750K has also been provided to support the 'No second night out' rough sleeper project in London. A further £1.5 million has been made available to help improve access to the private rented sector for single homeless people through the voluntary sector across the country.

This funding is on top of measures in the Spending Review designed to help the most vulnerable - including the homeless.

Over £400 million will be made available through homelessness grants over the Spending Review period to support the most vulnerable and tackle homelessness. The Government is also continuing to invest in the Places of Change hostels improvement programme, to ensure those coming off the streets get the support they need. Over £200 million over the Spending Review period will keep the Mortgage Rescue Scheme open to support homeowners facing the real and frightening prospect of homelessness as a result of repossession, to stay in their homes.

The Supporting People programme, which helps over a million of the most vulnerable people in our society to live independent lives including homeless people, victims of domestic violence and the elderly, was also protected as far as possible in the Comprehensive Spending Review - with £6.5 billion available over the next four years.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It is vital to Britain's economic future that we tackle the record Budget deficit that we inherited but we must also ensure that the most vulnerable in our society are protected. That's why in the Spending Review, we have maintained funding where it is needed most.
> 
> ""That's why we've protected homelessness grant funding, providing over £7 billion to support struggling families and the most vulnerable, helping families avoid repossession, helping take rough sleepers off our streets and helping people live independent lives that couldn't otherwise do so.
> 
> ""And today, I can confirm an extra £10 million for London councils, so they can support families affected by the housing benefit changes, and an additional £750K to help work towards ensuring no-one spends more than one night sleeping rough.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1847157,Grant Shapps asks communities to go for growth,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has announced almost £200m in the first wave of cash bonuses for communities that have decided to go for growth and build new homes through the New Homes Bonus scheme.

Explaining how the scheme will work Mr Shapps said the government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years, which for an affordable home will mean an extra £350 per house each year. Grant Shapps confirmed that the bonus will also apply to any empty properties brought back into use.

### Bonus calculator

The amount of extra cash an area will receive can be easily seen using the New Homes Bonus Calculator, available under 'Related downloads' on the [New Homes Bonus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/) page.

Selecting the 'Provisional allocations' option will lead to a page where each council can be selected from a drop down list.

People can now start talking to their council about how they would like to spend the money - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres.

The minister also said it will be up to the local communities and not Whitehall to decide how the building bonus is spent.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We need to get the country building again - but not through a Whitehall knows best arrogance. To kick start a housebuilding revolution development needs to be backed by local communities rather than opposed by them. That's why we are introducing powerful new incentives giving communities a reason to say yes to new homes. Rather than feeling the strain of new homes through extra pressure on local services local residents will feel the direct benefit as they get to choose how the money is spent.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2012570,Grant Shapps calls for 30-year mortgages,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today called on lenders to consider offering more longer-term fixed mortgages of as much as 30 years, to encourage greater stability in the housing market as a ""normal and sensible choice"" for homeowners in the future.

Speaking at the Building Societies Association's Annual Mortgage Seminar in London, Mr Shapps said that he wanted to start a national debate on long term fixed mortgages and how their introduction into the British market could contribute to greater house price stability.![Grant Shapps speaking to the Building Societies Association](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2013441)

There are currently no mortgages with guaranteed life long interest rates. Few mortgages available can be fixed for five or more years, with the deals that are available often being restricted to those borrowing less than three-quarters of their property's long-term value.

Mr Shapps said that longer-term products will ensure ""people know where they stand"", as they will give consumers greater certainty over the costs of buying a house in the long term and allow families on tight budgets to know exactly how much they will be paying for their home in the future.

The certainty of these longer-term mortgages can also bring new funding into the market by offering a long term fixed return for investors, and open up new finance to give first time buyers and those without much equity in their homes a better chance of getting a mortgage.

He argued that Government wants to see stability in the housing market and with interest rates in the long term, and that more long-term products coming on stream could help deliver this, alongside the ongoing deficit reduction efforts.

But the minister also said that consumers have deep-rooted expectations that they can and should be able to shop around for a better rate and do this frequently during the term of their mortgage. And no-one wants to pay hefty early repayment fees every time they remortgage or move house.

Greater use of 'portable' deals - where borrowers are able to move house and keep their existing mortgage, and 'cap and collar' arrangements where the interest rate on a loan can only move within limits and borrowers are not liable to sudden repayment increases, could make longer deals more appealing to consumers.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""In today's uncertain world, people want to know where they stand. Yet when it comes to buying a home, there are no mortgages available for them where they can fix their payments for a long time - the longest fixed-rate mortgage for many is five years.
> 
> ""Longer term mortgages - possibly as long as 30 years - could help families on tight budgets know exactly where they stand when they're buying a home, by giving them greater certainty over how much they will be paying for their home in years to come.
> 
> ""While they won't be right for everyone, lenders should start to look at the case for 30-year mortgages and how we can move to a more stable housing market where first-time buyers can get their first foothold on the property ladder at a cost they know they can afford.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1722708,Grant Shapps calls for greater transparency from social landlords,"Housing associations must follow in the footsteps of central and local government and open their books to public scrutiny, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

In a speech to the National Housing Federation annual conference in Birmingham, Mr Shapps warned that with public subsidy being reduced as Government works to tackle the deficit, housing associations will need to become more efficient, doing more for less while meeting the needs of local residents.

The Minister also argued that tenants would want to know if the chief executive of their housing association were paid more than the Prime Minister - and questioned whether this level of pay could be justified.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Housing associations have proved themselves to be experts at steering massive private investment towards social homes - without them the housing shortage in this country would be even more acute. But over recent years large amounts of public money has been invested and I want to know we can get the most out of this past, present and future public investment.
> 
> ""We're now in a new era of public spending - there will no return to the old way of doing things, and no one can afford to rest on their laurels. So I'm calling on organisations that deliver and manage social housing to throw open their books and show the people they serve where the money is going.
> 
> ""This isn't a gesture; we need to squeeze the most out of every pound spent. Where there are opportunities for greater efficiency the public will see these - and they will demand they are taken.""

He added:

> ""They want to know how many people think that their job is tougher than being Prime Minister.
> 
> ""And I want to know how it can be justified to pay enormous salaries which are ultimately being paid for either through the hard work and toil of taxpayers - or worse, from the rents of tenants who maybe the people in society least able to afford your salary.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1937920,Grant Shapps calls for more 'mates mortgages' to help struggling first time buyers,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps will today call on lenders to offer 'mates mortgages' so younger first time buyers can club together and take their first step on the property ladder.

With [new research](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/publicattitudeshousing) published today showing 86 per cent of people want to buy a home, Mr Shapps wants lenders to make it easier for friends who would like to buy a house and can afford the repayments, but are locked out the market by the requirement for a large individual deposit.

For groups of friends without access to the Bank of Mum and Dad, mates mortgages could become a mainstream alternative to years of saving, as well as providing a welcome boost to the housing market.

The Minister wants more lenders to offer straightforward mortgage products such as Britannia's 'Share to Buy', so increasing the number of these schemes that facilitate joint ownership will be the top item for discussion when he meets key housing and mortgage industry figures for a second First Time Buyers Summit.

He will also urge lenders to replicate a new 'First Time Buyers Pledge' by Lloyd's. Under the pledge more advice and assistance will be available to prospective homeowners, including a personal action plan for unsuccessful applicants setting out how they could be successful in the future, and a promise that failed applications will not affect the credit rating of first time buyers.

The summit been arranged by Mr Shapps to review progress since he made a rallying call to the housing industry earlier this year to step their efforts and help more prospective first time buyers fulfil their dream of buying their own home.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I'm delighted that progress has been made since the first summit I called to help first time buyers. More mortgage products are now available, and lenders, housebuilders and councils are cooperating better with each other to offer a range of options to prospective homeowners.
> 
> ""But much more still needs to be done. 'Mates mortgages' are one option I would like to see explored. If there are mates who are perfectly capable of paying monthly mortgage payments but are struggling to fund a deposit on their own, there should be straightforward options to unite with their friends and take the first step onto the housing ladder together.
> 
> ""That's why I have once again called on key figures from across the housing market to come together and discuss ways to improve the availability of mortgages, and how existing products can be promoted much better.
> 
> ""I also want to discuss how the improved service being offered to first time buyers by Lloyd's can be replicated across the sector. Eight out of ten aspiring homeowners under 30 can't get on the ladder without help from the Bank of Mum and Dad. So it is vital that every option to increase the availability of mortgages is pursued, so we don't lock a generation of young people out of the housing market.""

Mr Shapps welcomed the improvements that have been made since the first summit. This includes:

  * a range of new and innovative products developed jointly between lenders and housebuilders to offer mortgages on new build homes;
  * a growing number of local schemes providing local authority backed mortgages through Lloyds Local Lend a Hand;
  * a new Government FirstBuy scheme, specifically designed to help those struggling to buy their first home due to the need for large deposits, especially those in the military; and
  * better communication within the sector - a new website for lenders, housing associations, house builders and the public to promote joint working on affordable solutions including shared ownership and equity loans.

### Notes to editors

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1930175,Grant Shapps calls for more transparency in social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced plans to consult on a new way for tenants and members of the public to scrutinise how housing associations are run.

The Government will consult with housing associations later this year on whether to extend the scope of the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) to include housing associations, many of which receive substantial public investment.

Housing associations provide the affordable housing that millions of people across the country rely on, and Mr Shapps believes bringing housing associations under the Freedom of Information Act could make it easier for tenants and the public to find out more about how their landlords work, and what their taxes pay for.

Speaking at the Chartered Institute of Housing conference, Mr Shapps called on housing associations to follow the Government's lead and open up to more public scrutiny to help them drive efficiency and provide a better service to tenants.

Mr Shapps said the Government had put its own house in order by opening up to public scrutiny like never before, and it is now the turn of housing associations to embrace the new spirit of openness and become more transparent and efficient. He reminded housing association boards that, as social businesses, they should keep the salaries of their chief executives and senior officers under tight scrutiny in order to squeeze the maximum efficiency and value from shrinking resources.

The Ministry of Justice is currently consulting on potential inclusion of a range of further bodies under the Freedom of Information umbrella, and will now draw up plans to consult with housing associations on their possible inclusion in the proposals.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Housing associations have a long and distinguished track record of providing the affordable homes the millions of tenants rely on. But with more pressure on the public purse than ever, all organisations that receive public investment should become more transparent and open to the taxpayers who put the pennies in the purse. Tenants should also be able to scrutinise and understand the way in which their landlords take decisions.
> 
> ""That's why I'm delighted that housing associations will soon be consulted on whether they should be included under the Freedom of Information Act. Transparency is not just a nice-to-have, it is vital for driving down costs and ensuring more is achieved with every taxpayers' pound. Over the last few decades large amounts of ordinary peoples' cash has been invested in social housing, and the public now deserve to know if there are opportunities for efficiencies that can be exploited, so the very most is made of their past, present and future investment.
> 
> ""The public want to see value for money in organisations which receive significant public investment. So senior staff in housing associations who are earning high salaries should ask themselves whether they are justified, and whether it is a good way for a social business to spend money that is provided through the hard work of taxpayers, and the rents of tenants.""

Ministry of Justice Minister Lord McNally said:

> ""The public deserves a Government that is open and accountable for its actions, and the Coalition believes that the same should apply for any organisation that performs functions of a public nature.
> 
> ""This consultation with Housing Associations is linked to a wider programme of work that the Ministry of Justice is undertaking to extend the scope of the Freedom of Information Act, which already provides a vital tool for people to find out whether thousands of UK bodies are acting in the public interest and providing value for money.
> 
> ""We are already consulting a variety of additional bodies, such as the Local Government Group and Harbour Authorities, about their possible inclusion. We will also be bringing forward soon legislation to bring the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service within the scope of the Act.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1879760,Grant Shapps calls on communities to decide how to spend the rewards of growth,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on councils to sit down with residents and decide how to spend the rewards of going for growth.

The Minister confirmed the first cash payments through the New Homes Bonus, totalling almost £200m for areas building new homes.

In a letter to council leaders, Mr Shapps said these powerful incentives have the power to transform housebuilding by encouraging local communities to support rather than resist development - but it is vital that residents now have the opportunity to choose how these building bonuses are spent.

Through the New Homes Bonus the Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years. The bonus available for an affordable home will be up to 36 per cent more than for a similar market home, equivalent to an extra £350 per house premium every year. Empty properties brought back into use will also receive the cash bonus for six years.

This means councils can receive payments of almost £9,000 on average for each band D home or almost £11,000 for an equivalent affordable home. So if an area increased the number of homes by 1,000 units this could earn a community almost £10m to spend as they see fit - which could deliver a much needed economic boost to their local area at a time when public finances are tight.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The system where Whitehall told communities what homes they need to build never worked. Housebuilding declined for years, eventually slumping to its lowest peacetime level since 1924. The construction industry suffered terribly, and in many areas plans for new homes created a bitter legacy of divided communities and animosity towards developers.
> 
> ""This country needs more homes, so we need the nation to start building again - but this time with the backing of local communities rather than in the teeth of their opposition. That's why we're giving communities a reason to say yes to new homes through these powerful cash incentives.
> 
> ""But this funding from Government is only the start of the process - it is now essential that councils engage with their local community to decide how the money is spent, so residents feel the direct benefits of growth, rather than extra pressure on local services.""

Under the first cash payments for the scheme, 326 local authorities will receive a share of £200m for increasing the effective housing stock by almost 150,000 in 2010-11.

Communities themselves will decide how to spend this extra funding - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres.

### Notes to editors

  1. The New Homes Bonus is part of the Coalition Agreement and provides incentives for local authorities to deliver sustainable development, including for new homes and businesses. A consultation on the proposals was published on 12 November 2010. In February 2011 the Government published the Final Scheme Design for the New Homes Bonus and this can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/finalschemedesign](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/finalschemedesign).
  2. The long-term demand for housing is strong. Despite this, housing development has consistently fallen over the last decade. On average 26,000 fewer homes were built each year from 1997 to 2009, and in 2009 there were just 118,000 completions, the lowest level of house building in peacetime since 1924.
  3. The previous Government tried to remedy falling levels of housebuilding by using centrally determined housing targets that local authorities and communities had to meet. These failed to deliver the housing this country needs. The Housing and Planning Delivery Grant that was introduced to support targets and improve housing delivery was ineffective and complicated, and local authorities could not rely on it as a sufficient and stable incentive.
  4. A series of recent independent reviews by Sir Michael Lyons, Kate Barker and Professor Michael Ball highlighted the powerful role that local incentives could play in driving housing delivery. The current local government finance system does not provide the right incentive or rewards for councils to build new homes or bring long term empty properties back into use. If a local authority promotes the building of homes in the area it governs, little of the economic gain is captured by the local community. As a result existing residents see only further strain on public services and reduced amenity when new homes are built.
  5. The scheme will provide this incentive and return power back to local communities. Decisions on where and how development occurs will rest locally and ensure that the benefits of growth are returned to communities.
  6. £950m has been set aside over the Spending Review period to get the scheme up and running. In 2011-12 this is £200m and £250m in each of the remaining years. Funding beyond these levels will come from Formula Grant.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1722282,Grant Shapps calls on communities to prepare for their Right to Build,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has called on rural communities to work together and prepare for a new Right to Build that will enable them to give the green light to new developments in their area.

Mr Shapps confirmed that through the Community Right to Build, to be introduced in the forthcoming Localism Bill, local rural housing projects that secure the support of 75 per cent of voters and meet minimum planning criteria will go ahead without the need for a specific application for planning permission.

Initially, Ministers had proposed a 90 per cent threshold for approval of projects proposed through Right to Build - but it became clear that there was a strong preference for a lower threshold.

Under the proposed new Community Right to Build local people will be able to deliver the homes they really want, rather than being told their expansion plans don't fit into the local council's plans and therefore cannot go ahead.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""No-one knows the challenges that rural communities face better than the people who live there. I want to give them the power and the freedom to tackle local issues with local solutions through the Community Right to Build, so they can give the go-ahead to the new homes their area needs.
> 
> ""That's why new Community Right to Build organisations will not need to make specific planning applications for new developments. Those plans that get 75 per cent support in local referendums will no longer need to go to the Town Hall for approval - instead, work can begin much more quickly.
> 
> ""I've listened to the views of the public that responded strongly to our consultation, and I believe this threshold strikes the right balance between enabling communities to go ahead with their plans for expansion, while at the same time ensuring the support of the overwhelming majority of the wider community. And I hope it gives rural towns and villages across the country the prompt they need to prepare for a new Right to Build as a solution to the housing challenges they face.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1914314,Grant Shapps calls on communities to start building their vision for their local area,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today called on communities to start laying the foundations for the future developments they would like to see in their area.

Mr Shapps said that communities across the country should start looking at the opportunities that the new Community Right to Build proposals, currently before Parliament, could offer them.

And he said that urban areas should look to making use of the new powers - after he extended the scheme which was previously restricted to rural areas only - so that all communities across the country benefit from the new homes, shops and facilities they really want.

This new Community Right to Build will shift power from Government and councils to neighbourhoods and allow people to deliver the homes and development that they really want.

And to kick off the discussions within communities, Mr Shapps launched a new guide that gives people an idea about what the new powers could mean for their area, and encourages them to think about the sort of community-led development they want to see.

Under the proposals, which are contained in the Localism Bill, community organisations would be able to approve new local developments without the need to go through the normal planning application process, as long as the proposals meet certain criteria and there is community backing in a local referendum. Projects with the support of more than 50 per cent of those that vote in a referendum will get the go-ahead.

This will give communities the power to decide how to meet the local priorities in their area. For example additional housing to meet the demand of future generations, new shops where communities want to offer low rent deals to local convenience stores or farm shops, or a new community hall or sports facilities.

A new guide is published today offering information to people who are considering taking forward a community-led scheme which will for the first time be distributed not just to countryside communities but also to community groups in urban areas.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I want communities of all shapes and sizes, living in the smallest of villages and the largest of cities, to have the chance to drive forward their own plans for the future of their neighbourhoods without being hindered by bureaucracy and red tape.
> 
> ""The Community Right to Build currently before Parliament would do just that, giving local people the chance to give the go-ahead to new, small-scale developments that meet certain criteria and also, crucially, the test of public opinion.
> 
> ""I would urge anyone wanting to shape the future of their local area and get the homes they want built to look at today's guide. Whether these communities are living in an urban area or a countryside setting, it should give them the pointers they need so they can lay the foundations for making their housebuilding dreams a reality.""

With the countdown to the Government's Green Deal initiative underway, the Minister urged social landlords to make a positive difference to their tenants' lives by using existing funding models to start their own 'Pay As You Save' scheme, making homes in their area warmer and more comfortable to live in, and at the same time cheaper to run. 

Mr Shapps pointed to pioneer projects, similar to the Green Deal, which have already started and could be replicated elsewhere. In the largest scheme of its kind in![Thermal image of a house](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2014693) Manchester, the Social Homes Ecofit scheme means improvements such as solid wall insulation and better heating systems are being made to up to 9,000 social homes to make them more energy efficient, at no upfront cost.

The upgrades could save tenants up to £500 per year on energy bills, and at the same time create more than 1,800 jobs and bring a £100 million boost to businesses in Manchester carrying out the home improvements. Mr Shapps now wants other social landlords to follow their lead, and use every opportunity to improve the lives of their tenants and at the same time bring a much needed economic boost to local economies.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Our homes count for over a quarter of all UK emissions - it's essential we do more to make them greener. And at time when tenants are feeling the pinch of high energy prices, it is more important than ever that social landlords use this opportunity to take the simple steps that could save their tenants hundreds of pounds through reduced bills.
> 
> ""Measures such as the Green Deal will make a huge difference to the lives of tenants, and help landlords in their efforts to make their homes cleaner and greener. By making the most of the opportunities that are available now social landlords can get a head start on upgrading their homes and give an immediate shot in the arm to the local economy.""
> 
> ""In Greater Manchester a number of projects are already underway to improve thousands of homes so tenants can enjoy the benefits of warmer homes and lower energy bills. The scheme will not only reduce tenants' energy bills but also create hundreds of jobs for local people. So I want other social landlords to learn from their example, and see what they can do to help their tenants and boost local businesses.""

Under the Green Deal, which will launch in autumn 2012, homeowners and tenants will be able sign up for Green Deal providers to upgrade properties so they become more energy efficient. No money will be paid upfront - instead people will be able to pay for the improvements over time, with the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the savings on energy bills. By allowing the improvements to be paid for gradually, the scheme will remove one of the biggest barriers for retrofitting existing homes - the cost of the initial investment.

### Notes to editors

1. Social landlords can use their existing powers to vary rents and service charges paid by tenants to gradually recoup a proportion of the upfront costs of the energy efficiency improvements. The increased charges will be offset by lower fuel bills so tenants will still be better off - a 'Pay As You Save' model similar to the Green Deal. The remainder of the costs can be met through other existing funding sources such as:

  * The Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP), which requires energy suppliers to deliver every saving measures to customers in the most deprived parts of the country; and

  * The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), which requires the ""big six"" energy suppliers to make savings in the amounts of carbon dioxide emitted by households, by promoting low-carbon technologies.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1682983,Grant Shapps calls time on the town hall pollsters,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today scrapped the Place Survey, one of the largest surveys in Europe that was due to be conducted by local authorities this autumn.

Today's move to scrap the survey is part of concerted efforts by the new Government to release councils from Whitehall control - leaving them free to respond flexibly and effectively to the needs of their residents.

It follows the scrapping of Comprehensive Area Assessments by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles in June, instead making councils more accountable to residents rather than ministers in Whitehall.

The announcement also follows on from the new Government's plans to require councils to publish online their spending over £500; to stop Town Hall publications which compete with local newspapers; and to block the practice of councils and quangos hiring agencies to lobby Government.

The Place Survey is a postal survey conducted by every council in England. Introduced in 2008, it involves over half a million residents and is estimated to cost more than £5 million to run.

Results have been fed back to central Government and used to measure councils' performance on a range of centrally-imposed targets.

Fieldwork for this year's survey was due to take place by all councils between September and December this year - but the Minister has today scrapped this to prevent the cash being diverted from vital public services.

Mr Shapps believes that the Place Survey was an example of wasteful municipal spending - which required council officials to ask residents a range of intrusive personal questions.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""These surveys are a cosmetic exercise which never change anything. Let's give real power back to the people - such as letting taxpayers veto high council tax rises.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1841461,Grant Shapps confirms merger of key design organisations,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today confirmed that two leading bodies in design are to merge their activities on design for housing - giving local communities greater opportunities to have their say on how their areas should look and feel in the future.

Ministers plan to expand the Design Council by bringing in some of the activities, skills, knowledge and expertise from the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment to create a one-stop shop, providing a service to industry, councils and local communities.

The move has the support of leading designers and architects.

In completing this merger, there will be greater opportunities to build on the Design Council's strong track record of offering independent mentoring and support services to local residents about design issues in their neighbourhoods. And the inclusion of key activities currently carried out by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment will strengthen the organisation's role in championing design at the heart of national priorities.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The design of a neighbourhood can have a significant and substantial impact on the quality of life of its residents. Design can prevent crime and anti-social behaviour, help restore local pride in an area, and ensure that area remains an attractive place for people to live and bring up their families for generations.
> 
> ""I want local residents themselves to have a much greater say over how their communities are designed. By merging these elements of the Design Council and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, we can continue to improve the local support that is available for people to do this, and build on the strong track record in offering mentoring, training and support.
> 
> ""This merger, which has the support of leading experts in the field, will not only mean the excellent work the Commission has already undertaken can continue, but will also ensure that every taxpayer's pound spent on improving design is spent wisely and efficiently.""

Minister for Universities and Science, David Willetts, whose department co-sponsors the Design Council, said:

> ""I'm delighted that we have managed to secure an even better future for the Design Council. The merger with CABE will allow both organisations to enhance their valuable work and I look forward to seeing the results of the new body's contributions to growth and renewal in the UK.""

Tourism and Heritage Minister John Penrose said:

> ""This is a perfect fit. The Commission's fantastic work in promoting the value of good design of buildings and places and shaping sustainable communities will continue, in partnership with the Design Council's work putting design at the heart of the economy and acting as a driver for growth. I want to congratulate all those involved in working together to make this happen.""

The merger is supported by Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud, as well as organisations including the Royal Institute of British Architects.

Kevin McCloud, presenter of Channel 4's Grand Designs, said:

> ""I think this is one of the most sensible decisions this government has made. The Design Council and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment have complementary skills, are both beacons of excellence and have recently been working in converging areas. Design and Architecture increasingly overlap as our built environment gets more complex. Interior designers, lighting and product designers and specialists in graphic, landscape, urban planning and retail design all make a significant contribution to how our world feels and functions.
> 
> ""I'm particularly looking forward to seeing one central body of excellence working with communities across Britain, helping to promote and share the ideas that make our homes, workplaces and means of transport work better and more sustainably and helping to make brilliant architecture and memorable, distinctive places. There is a lot to do.""

RIBA Chief Executive Harry Rich said:

> ""The RIBA welcomes the partnership of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment and the Design Council. Both organisations have delivered excellent work to improve the quality of the built environment and champion design across government, and we are delighted that their experience and influence will continue in a new form in support of our shared objective of improving the quality of buildings, communities and the environment.""

Lord Bichard, chairman of the Design Council, said:

> ""Now more than ever we need design at the heart of social and economic renewal, and a strong message about design in all its forms. I am looking forward to working with our colleagues at the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment and with a wide range of industry partners to make this a success.""

Paul Finch OBE, Chairman of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, said:

> ""This very positive move will place architecture at the heart of the economy as a driver for competitive businesses and places. I am very much looking forward to the combined expertise of our two organisations to coming together to achieve that.""

### Notes to editors

  1. A review of the Design Council was completed in October 2010 as part of the Government's reform of the public bodies landscape. The review, chaired by Martin Temple CBE, considered the role of the state as design sponsor and the role of design within social and economic policy. The main conclusion was that there is a compelling case for the Design Council to continue in its role as the national strategic body for design and to champion design in an efficient, inclusive and open form.
  2. The Design Council will cease to be a Non Departmental Public Body (NDPB) but will retain its charitable status and become an independent not-for profit organisation incorporated by Royal Charter. The target date for the transition is 1 April 2011, subject to agreement by the Privy Council and Charity Commission.
  3. The Design Council will continue to act as advisor and intermediary delivering key services to government. In addition to the new areas of activity which it is taking on, previously provided by CABE, its work will focus on three areas: design demonstration, knowledge networks and design policy advice to government. The Design Council will connect both private and public sector services to design, and will utilise the UK's design capabilities to tackle some of the nation's biggest challenges such as healthcare and climate change.
  4. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) is the Government's advisor on architecture, urban design and public space. It was created in 1999 as the champion for design quality in buildings, spaces and places across England. It promotes the best in architecture and urban design by promoting high standards in the design of buildings and spaces, advising all those who create, manage and utilise the built environment, and stimulating public debate. CABE is sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), with additional funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). DCMS's Spending Review announcement on 20 October 2010 announced its funding for CABE would cease after 2011-12.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2033553,Grant Shapps encourages communities to high jump red tape and celebrate London 2012 with their own street games,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today fired the starting pistol in the race to get Britain warmed up for London 2012 and plan Street Games.

The Minister urged communities across the country to dive right into the spirit of London 2012 and host sporting events in their own neighbourhoods - before, during and after the Games.

He also put the ball firmly in the court of local councils, urging them to ""high jump over red tape and regulations"" and make it easier for communities to come together for sack races, football tournaments and tug-of-war contests in their streets. And where poor weather threatens to stop play, Mr Shapps called on councils to look at how community halls could be offered as possible venues for local events.

Ministers want councils to avoid putting hurdles in the way of communities hosting their own street games, and become key team players in helping to hit the target of increasing the nation's participation in sport - a vital part of London 2012's enduring legacy.

The Minister argued that communities should box clever and avoid some of the common myths about hosting events such as Street Sports Days. The Government is taking steps to bust the many 'health and safety myths' that often prevent neighbourhoods from putting on their own events. These include:

  * The need for a licence - organisers do not need a licence unless they plan to sell alcohol or charge for a performance.
  * Fees charged for road closures - the Government has scrapped guidance that was used by councils as a means of charging people wanting to close their road, but now councils will charge nothing for this.
  * The need to buy expensive road signs and insurance - some councils lend signs and cones to organisers, while Streets Alive have downloadable signs from their website, which also includes advice on insurance; and
  * Plans to scrap the need for Temporary Entertainment Licences, making it easier for streets to play music at their Games. Under Government proposals, rules requiring people to apply and sometimes pay for licences for many events where there is little or no risk of trouble would be scrapped.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Next year, people across the country will rightly want to celebrate London hosting the greatest sporting event in the world. But residents shouldn't have to wrestle with bureaucracy to put on their own events - it should be easy to team up and celebrate next year's Olympic Games with their own Street Games.
> 
> ""That's why I want councils to be the torch-bearers for getting the nation on their feet and getting more involved in sport. Rather than putting up the hurdles and preventing communities from putting on their own street games, I want them to high jump the red tape and regulations and make arranging local events easier.
> 
> ""We want London 2012 to be the best Games ever, but preparations should not be confined to the Capital. Getting ready for next year's once-in-a-lifetime event is a marathon, not a sprint, so I would urge councils and communities across the country to start planning now for their own celebrations.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2040767,Grant Shapps hails progress towards decent social homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today hailed the rapid and impressive progress that has been made to improve the nation's social housing stock, with the numbers of homes considered 'non decent' down by more than a quarter.

Despite the need to cut the deficit, the Government will spend £2.1 billion on the Decent Homes programme to make much-needed improvements to council and housing association homes.

And new figures published today show the Government ahead of schedule to deliver the improvements that tenants need and deserve.

The numbers of non decent council homes fell by more than a quarter over the past year. Councils have fitted 110,000 new kitchens, 82,000 new bathrooms and 126,000 new central heating systems into their properties.

This dramatic fall now means that 93 per cent of all social homes now meet the Decent standard - more than the 92 per cent predicted a year ago, and up from 90 per cent of all homes in 2009.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""When we came to Government we pledged to protect the most vulnerable and committed to improving damp and cold homes.
> 
> ""I am delighted to see such rapid and impressive progress towards ensuring that all social homes are at the standard that tenants deserve and rightly expect.
> 
> ""Today's figures demonstrate how councils and housing associations are ahead of schedule in delivering the much-needed improvements to their stock.
> 
> ""And because we're spending over £2 billion on this vital programme, I fully expect to see the numbers of refurbished properties rise further over the next few years so that more families benefit from the vast improvements to their homes that they have waited so long for.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1912935,Grant Shapps helps local communities make cycling safer,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today set the wheels in motion to give councils the freedom to make their areas more bike-friendly and offer safe routes for cyclists.

Cycling is fast becoming a national obsession - Great Britain's cycling team shone at the Beijing Olympics with 14 medals and are looking to repeat their success at London's 2012 Games, while more and more people are getting on their bikes for an exercising and eco-friendly commute to work.

But all too often their routes are diverted onto busy roads and highways, by outdated byelaws that restrict access to parks, promenades and other public spaces.

Red tape puts the brakes on efforts to remove byelaws, as councils are required to first seek permission from Government Ministers.

So today, Mr Shapps has confirmed that he will give the green light for councils to revoke any byelaws they no longer want or need without any Whitehall interference - helping to move their plans to support cyclists up a gear.

He argued that councils know their areas best and will therefore know how best to maintain their local public spaces so they are safe and accessible not just to cyclists but to all sections of the community - and that they should be free to make the necessary measures to cut red tape without first having to seek Whitehall's permission. But as part of the Government's aim to avoid creating additional bureaucracy, Ministers will put in place checks and balances to ensure any new byelaws put forward by councils do not impose unnecessary or excessive burdens.

With these new powers planned, the Minister called on communities to get on their bikes and follow the lead already set by councils across the country that have already amended their byelaws to open up new cycle routes. These include:

  * Canterbury, where the local council made changes to byelaws relating to the local promenade around Herne Bay to allow completion of part of the National Cycle Network
  * Worthing, where the council updated byelaws governing the promenade so cyclists could use that rather than risk travelling along a busy main road
  * Harrogate, where next month changes to byelaws will come into force allowing cyclists to use designated routes across the Stray, an open piece of land in the town centre.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""This Bank Holiday, and over the course of the next week, thousands of budding Chris Hoys and Victoria Pendletons will be getting on their bikes and making the most of the half term holidays.
> 
> ""I want to make sure they can cycle in safety and where appropriate use the local parks, promenades and public spaces but all too often unnecessary, unwanted and outdated byelaws instead force them onto nearby busy roads.
> 
> ""This Government has already been taking the stabilisers off councils and trusting them to do what's right for their area - and now, I am giving them the freedom to revoke whatever byelaws they need to in order to crank up their efforts and make their local areas safer for cyclists.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2027139,Grant Shapps highlights support for struggling homeowners,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today reassured anxious homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages of the wide range of support available to help them keep their homes, and ensure that repossession remains the last resort.

Latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show the number of homes taken into possession to be largely unchanged, increasing by one per cent on the previous quarter to 9,200.

In light of this, the Council of Mortgage Lenders expects the number of repossessions in 2011 to be lower than their original forecast of 40,000.

The Minister made clear that just as the Government is providing help for people wanting to get on the property ladder, a range of support is also available to keep them in their homes and avoid the threat of repossession.

The Directgov website - [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgages](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/BuyingAndSellingYourHome/Mortgagesandrepossessions/index.htm) (external link) - has lots of free advice and information to homeowners struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and worried about the threat of losing their homes. Helpful advice is also on hand from organisations such as Citizens Advice, Shelter and the National Debtline.

And over the next two years the Government is investing more than £200 million into the Mortgage Rescue scheme. The scheme, available through local authorities, is designed to offer a last resort to the most vulnerable families to avoid repossession.  
    
The Minister argued that the most important thing the Government is doing to help those struggling with their mortgages is to tackle the national deficit and prevent the need for rapid increases in interest rates.

Housing Minster Grant Shapps said:

> ""Owning a home is an aspiration for many people. But just as we are helping people to get onto the property ladder we are also committed to ensuring advice, information and real practical support is available to help ensure that even in tough times people are helped to stay on the property ladder and that repossession remains the last resort.   
   
""Our homes are our havens and with so much at stake it's easy to see why sometimes people bury their heads in the sand and ignore their mortgage worries. But by tackling the problem early, speaking to their lenders and taking advantage of the free advice and information available from the Directgov website as well as organisations such as Citizens Advice, Shelter and the National Debtline homeowners can regain control and get in the best possible position to keep their homes.  
   
""For our part the Government will continue to tackle the record deficit and avoid the need for rapid interest rate rises, keeping the pressure off homeowners feeling the pinch.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1981559,Grant Shapps issues landlords with call to arms on tackling homelessness,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today called on the country's top 50 housing associations to use their expertise and wide-ranging experience to bolster Government-led efforts to tackle homelessness.

The Minister highlighted the need to help prevent people from sleeping on the streets, and to provide a lifeline to those who have been left languishing on social housing waiting lists for years.

On Wednesday, he met the 50 housing associations whose contributions will help ensure that the Government's Affordable Homes Programme will exceed original expectations.

Contrary to recent reports, the Government is on track to exceed original estimates of 150,000 new affordable properties - by 20,000 homes. The 50 developers Mr Shapps met today will build the vast majority of homes in the programme - some 75 per cent.

And going forward, the Government is also inviting views on the draft National Planning Policy Framework, which streamlines national policy from over 1,000 pages to just 52 pages of policy. Combining all national planning policies into one concise document will unblock the system to enable more homes to be built.

Many of these homes will be available for those people on social housing waiting lists - but the Government is also taking steps to help those who have been sleeping rough or are in temporary accommodation.

For the most vulnerable in our society, the Minister emphasised how the Government is maintaining the homelessness grant, with £400million funding available to tackle homelessness, while the London ""No Second Night Out"" project is being extended nationwide to ensure no-one spends more than one night on the country's streets.

And for the first time, the Government has established a Ministerial Working Group on homelessness, which brings together eight departments to tackle its complex causes.

And the Localism Bill currently before Parliament contains proposals to give councils flexibility to offer those owed the main homelessness duty good quality private rented housing - with legislation still in place to ensure no family spends time in Bed and Breakfast accommodation unless in an emergency, and then for no more than six weeks.

The Minister also pointed to the need to keep interest rates low, and to do this the Government must continue to cut the deficit it inherited, to help people stay in their homes. That is why reforms are being introduced to cut the housing benefit bill, but with a £190million fund available to councils to help those most in need.

Mr Shapps also highlighted how these 50 housing associations area valuable part of the solution to tackling homelessness, and can use their expertise to provide the stable and secure roof over the heads of those people in desperate need of housing.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""There is a need to tackle homelessness in this country. Families who have been languishing on waiting lists for years are crying out for the stability and security that a new home can provide, and I want to see an end to the need for anyone to sleep rough on Britain's streets.
> 
> ""That's why for the first time we have a cross-Whitehall group of ministers dedicated to tackling its complex causes, and it's why we're maintaining £400million homelessness grant funding. But I also see a crucial role for housing associations.
> 
> ""Already they are helping to ensure our Affordable Homes programme exceeds expectations and delivers up to 170,000 new homes. But today I'm calling on the country's top 50 landlords to work with Whitehall and Town Halls and offer their experience and expertise to help those in greatest need across the country.""

Alongside the Affordable Housing Programme the Government has already made £200million payments to councils through the New Homes Bonus, which matches the council tax raised on new properties for six years - with extra funding for new affordable homes.  Further funding is due to be announced shortly.

The Minister highlighted the new FirstBuy Scheme, which will help over 10,500 people get their first foothold on the property ladder, as a key measure the Government is taking to help more people realise their dream of home ownership.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1984732,Grant Shapps issues message to struggling households: seek early support,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today sent a clear message that any household threatened with homelessness must seek help and advice as early as possible.

He said that a wide range of support remains available to those struggling to stay in their homes and that local councils have a strong track record of providing support to households at risk of homelessness and so should be a first point of call for anyone worried about holding onto their home.

The Minister was speaking as new figures out today show there were 11,820 people owed a main homelessness duty in the second quarter of the year - 17 per cent higher than the same period in 2010.

But the numbers of people in temporary accommodation on 30 June this year fell by four per cent compared to the same date in 2010.

Councils have a duty to ensure that free housing advice and information is available for everyone seeking it and that they may be able to help people stay in their home by:

  * providing budget and rent advice - if a household is having problems paying the rent and are at risk of losing their home;
  * helping find out if households are eligible for any benefits to help with housing costs; and
  * speaking to the landlord on behalf of those at risk of eviction, or offering a rent bond to help them find alternative private rented accommodation.

People can also speak to their mortgage lender who may be able to change the terms of mortgages to make repayments more affordable, or to an independent charity such as Shelter, the National Debtline or Citizens Advice Bureau, who could provide advice and help with managing finances.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Whilst homelessness remains at a historic low, today's figures underline how the effects of the worst recession for a generation continue to deliver difficult times for households up and down the country.
> 
> ""But anyone facing financial difficulty or the prospect of losing their own home is not alone. There is help available and everything will be done to help people avoid homelessness: I urge anyone who thinks they may be at risk of losing their home to take action immediately, and give themselves a greater chance of staying in it.
> 
> ""Whilst this Government gets on with the rescue mission on our economy - dealing with the huge deficit we inherited to avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates and keep further pressure off households, households themselves must seek early support from their council, lender or one of the charity bodies who offer support.""

Yesterday, Mr Shapps met with 50 housing developers to hear about their plans to get Britain building again and how Government-led efforts to help those in housing need are being supported by the industry. And he heard first hand how the Affordable Homes Programme will exceed original expectations - delivering an estimated 150,000 new affordable properties - an increase of 20,000 homes on that expected.

He said that this demonstrated that Government was taking the action necessary to getting the economy back on track, support growth and shore up the long-term outlook for homeowners. Other measures crucial to this he said were reforming the slow and inefficient planning system and cutting red tape and scrapping costly regulations, to make housing more affordable and unlock new investment in the sector.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1949751,Grant Shapps joins forces with industry to take self build to the masses,"Grant Shapps has today welcomed a new action plan for the self build industry that he says could be the turning point that takes it to the masses.

Meeting with the National Self Build Association (NaSBA) - the representatives of the self-build industry - Mr Shapps said that for too long obstacles have led to the UK having one of the lowest proportions of new homes built by self-builders in Europe, and that he wanted to see the self build industry become a mainstream housing option.

Earlier this year, Mr Shapps asked NaSBA and other industry experts to work with his officials to prepare an action plan to boost the number of self-builders across the country, and address the common barriers aspiring self-builders face.

Today they presented him with their findings on tackling the main challenges holding the self-build industry back: the availability of land and finance, lack of support from industry for new self builders and the impact of regulation.

Their report sets out 15 proposals for action to help self builders, including that:

  * More land be made available for self-builders. It calls for Government to ask councils to gauge the demand for self build in their area and account for this in their planning strategies.
  * New implementation models, which include making serviced plots available to self builders, be actively promoted across the industry and the public sector.
  * Lenders be encouraged to offer more finance products for those building their own home.
  * Revolving funds should be made available to support group self build schemes, which Mr Shapps has pledged to give serious consideration to.
  * Over-burdensome regulations hampering the growth of the sector be removed or simplified, and calls for Government to introduce more proportionate planning rules for small developments.
  * The self build industry itself needs to provide clearer independent information to would-be self builders. A new online self build 'portal' is proposed to be set up to enable more people to get a project underway.

Mr Shapps said that significant work had been put into producing the report and thanked all those involved, and that he will consider any proposed action for Government carefully; prioritising those that could have the biggest and quickest impact on the growth of the sector.

He pointed to the significant Government action which is underway as a sign of its commitment to growing the industry:

  * He has written, in discussion with the Building Societies Association, to Chief Executives of banks and building societies, calling on them to make more finance options available to those looking to build their own home.
  * Promoting the use of publicly owned land for self build housing, confirming that the Government will lead the way by earmarking land at Hemel Hempstead for self builders as part of plans to release more land for redevelopment and seek to identify further sites and opportunities.
  * The action underway to reduce the burden of regulation on the house building industry and through the Localism Bill to put power in the hands of communities up and down the country.
  * The forthcoming consultation on the National Planning Policy Framework which will push power down to communities, and have a strong presumption in favour of sustainable development at its heart.

He challenged the industry to get behind the proposed self build 'portal', saying that key to opening up the industry to more people was improving access to the self build concept.

Up to 20,000 people build their own homes each year - putting a roof over their family's head, developing their skills in a range of areas, and quickly integrating themselves into the local community through contact with local suppliers and tradesman.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Self builders deliver affordable, greener and more innovatively-designed homes, and make a big contribution to the number of new homes built in this country. But there is still significant opportunity for growth in the sector which can only be opened up if Government and industry work together.
> 
> ""Today's report is the culmination of months of hard work by the industry, and sets out extensive proposals for action on how we can relinquish the industry of its tag of being just for the rich and privileged.
> 
> ""Government is already taking significant steps to make self build not only more attractive but also more accessible. But I pledge to continue pushing for further action to make self-build an easier option for everyone.
> 
> ""That's why I will be meeting with some of our biggest retailers to discuss how they can help support the growth of the sector and I challenge the industry to get behind the proposed self build 'portal'. And I will immediately begin looking into the practicalities of establishing suitable revolving fund facilities for community self build projects, so that more projects can get off the ground.""

Ted Stevens, Chairman of the National Self Build Association said:

> ""This action plan is the most positive development in the self build sector for probably 50 years, and if we are able to deliver on the key recommendations, we could see significant growth in the self build sector, and result in tens of thousands of additional people being able to build their own affordable properties. In turn this will create jobs, stimulate growth within the self build supply chain and help people get the custom designed, modestly priced and very sustainable homes they really want.""

Paul Broadhead, Head of Mortgage Policy, Building Societies Association said:

> ""I welcome the launch of today's Action Plan as a positive first step in making self build more accessible to UK home buyers. Self build could help to address some of the housing shortage we have seen stifling the UK housing market and empower consumers. The Action Plan provides a good starting place and I look forward to continuing work with the Minister and other contributors to making the self build market more accessible to those aspiring to build their own homes. Obtaining finance for self build is sometimes seen as a complicated and arduous process, and I hope the launch of the report will go some way to dispelling some of the myths surrounding self build.""

Raymond Connor, Chief Executive of BuildStore Financial Services, said:

> ""The proposals outlined in the Action Plan and level of support from Government will help to trigger the new revolution of home building. Growing the industry will be a massive and much-needed boost for local economies and the construction supply chain, as well as aspiring self builders.
> 
> ""BuildStore has been championing self build as a valid housing procurement route for some time, and with the changing housing market creating the perfect conditions, self build is set to become mainstream. The ability for people to design and build a home to their own specifications has huge appeal, and the fact that it can be more affordable than buying on the open market makes it an obvious choice for many people wanting to get on or move up the housing ladder.""

",21-Jul-11,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,,,,grant-shapps,,,,
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1846754,Grant Shapps kickstarts local housebuilding revolution,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today kicked off a local housebuilding revolution where communities who go for growth by building new homes reap the benefits and at the same time deliver a much needed economic boost to their local area.

The Minister announced the first cash bonuses totalling almost £200m for communities building new homes and confirmed final details of how local housebuilding will be transformed through powerful incentives that will encourage local communities to back rather than oppose development - as they get to choose how these building bonuses are spent.

The Government has set aside almost £1bn to kickstart this scheme and ensure those areas that go for growth now benefit now. In the longer term incentives will be funded from Formula Grant and Government expects £1.5bn to be paid to communities annually once the scheme is in full swing.

Through the New Homes Bonus the Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years. The bonus available for an affordable home will be up to 36 per cent more than for a similar market home, equivalent to an extra £350 per house premium every year. Empty properties brought back into use will also receive the cash bonus for six years.

This works out at payments of over £9,000 paid on average to each Band D home or almost £11,000 for an equivalent affordable home. So if an area increased the number of homes by 1,000 units this could earn a community £10m to spend as they see fit - significant funding at a time when public finances are tight.

These incentives are part of Government's wider programme to put power in the hands of local communities to drive economic growth and create jobs.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Telling communities what homes they need and where they should be built has had catastrophic consequences. Housebuilding levels have nosedived hitting the construction industry hard and in many areas caused local tension by dividing communities.
> 
> ""We need to get the country building again - but not through a Whitehall knows best arrogance. To kick start a housebuilding revolution development needs to be backed by local communities rather than opposed by them. That's why we are introducing powerful new incentives giving communities a reason to say yes to new homes. Rather than feeling the strain of new homes through extra pressure on local services local residents will feel the direct benefit as they get to choose how the money is spent.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""These incentives are part of the Coalition Government's wider drive to put power in the hands of local communities to boost economic growth and create jobs. It is a real opportunity for communities to not only build new homes and provide a much needed shot in the arm to the local economy but also to address other local priorities at a time when public finances are tight. I know many councils have already seen this potential and are forging ahead with bold plans. But I urge all councils to now work with residents to agree how the bonus can benefit them.""

With housebuilding at its lowest peacetime level since 1924 the country needs new homes now and the economy needs the boost to jobs and prosperity this brings. That's why those areas currently building homes will be benefit now and Ministers announced the first cash payments being made under the scheme. 326 local authorities will receive a share of almost £200m for increasing the housing stock by almost 150,000 in the first year of this scheme.

Communities themselves will decide how to spend this extra funding - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres.

This will mean that for the first time, rather than having development forced on them from Whitehall through centrally imposed targets, there is a reason for communities to support growth as they will be able to see the benefits of development in their area for themselves.

Ministers see the New Homes Bonus as a real opportunity for communities to not only build much needed homes and give their area a welcome economic boost but also through the bonus payment to address other local priorities. Ministers have called on all councils to consult residents on how they can work together to agree how the Bonus could be used to meet their local needs.

### Notes to editors

  1. The New Homes Bonus is part of the Coalition Agreement and provides incentives for local authorities to deliver sustainable development, including for new homes and businesses. A consultation on the proposals was published on 12 November 2010. The Government is today publishing the  Final Scheme Design for the New Homes Bonus and this can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/finalschemedesign](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/finalschemedesign).
  2. The long-term demand for housing is strong. Despite this, housing development has consistently fallen over the last decade. On average 26,000 fewer homes were built each year from 1997 to 2009, and in 2009 there were just 118,000 completions, the lowest level of house building in peacetime since 1924.
  3. The previous Government tried to remedy falling levels of housebuilding by using centrally determined housing targets that local authorities and communities had to meet. These failed to deliver the housing this country needs. The Housing and Planning Delivery Grant (HPDG) that was introduced to support targets and improve housing delivery was ineffective and complicated, and local authorities could not rely on it as a sufficient and stable incentive.
  4. A series of recent independent reviews by Sir Michael Lyons, Kate Barker and Professor Michael Ball highlighted the powerful role that local incentives could play in driving housing delivery. The current local government finance system does not provide the right incentive or rewards for councils to build new homes or bring long term empty properties back into use. If a local authority promotes the building of homes in the area it governs, little of the economic gain is captured by the local community. As a result existing residents see only further strain on public services and reduced amenity when new homes are built.
  5. The scheme will provide this incentive and return power back to local communities. Decisions on where and how development occurs will rest locally and ensure that the benefits of growth are returned to communities.
  6. £946m has been set aside over the Spending Review period to get the scheme up and running. In 2011-12 this is almost £200m and £250m in each of the remaining years. Funding beyond these levels will come from Formula Grant.
  7. Details of funding allocations for 2011-12 being announced today can be found using the New Home Bonus Calculator, which can be found under 'Related downloads' at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/).

#### Supportive statements

Mark Clare, CEO of Barratts:

> ""Clarity on how the new homes bonus will operate is an important step forward and we are already talking to local authorities about what the implications of our planned developments will be in terms of additional funding for them. However, there is still some way to go to define the wider policy framework needed to ensure that the localist agenda can provide the new housing the nation needs.""

John Tutte, Group Managing Director, Redrow plc said:

> ""Redrow welcomes any incentive to address the chronic shortage of new homes brought about by failures in the planning system to deliver housing in areas of most need. We believe the New Homes Bonus is a practical solution that will encourage many local authorities to grant more planning permissions for new homes. In response to the announcement of the bonus, we are already working with a number of local authorities to bring forward much-needed new housing.""

Stephen Stone, Chief Executive of Crest Nicholson said:

> ""There are some very real challenges facing the housing industry at the moment and unless we take some decisive measures to mitigate their effect, the prospects for recovery will be severely hampered. We are already experiencing a severe housing shortage in the UK and there is a real risk that, unless direct action is taken to help unlock the market, issues around scarcity of supply will only be exacerbated. It's clear that maintaining levels of housing investment should be a key priority and incentives such as the New Homes Bonus, which are designed to increase housing levels and redress the current imbalance in supply and demand, should be welcomed.""

Stewart Baseley, Executive Chairman on the Home Builders Federation said:

> ""The country is facing an acute housing crisis and it is imperative we have a planning system that delivers sufficient land for the homes we need. The New Homes Bonus is a crucial part of any new incentive based structure and a simple, easy to understand system is essential.""

#### New Homes Bonus launch quotes - 11 February 2011

Professor Michael Ball, Reading University:

> ""My recent review of house building for the Department, as well an extensive body of academic work, highlights the importance of providing incentives to encourage communities and local authorities to support housing development in their area. For this reason, I welcome the New Homes Bonus as a step in the right direction.""

Dr Christian Hilber, London School of Economics:

> ""Our research shows that constraints from the current planning system on the amount of land that is made available for housing development, has a causal effect on house price inflation (and affordability) in England. It also demonstrates that such constraints substantially increase short and long term house price volatility. Our research notes that the present misalignment of costs and benefits arising from development acts as a strong disincentive to local areas to support such development. Based also on evidence from overseas, we recommend the use of strong fiscal incentives to help change behaviours and reverse this position.""

Mark Clare is CEO at Barratts, the UK's biggest builder by volume:

> ""This consultation is a welcome step forward as the incentive system proposed is simple and clear - we are already talking to local authorities about what the implications of our planned developments will be in terms of additional funding for them. However, there is still someway to go to define the policy framework needed to ensure that the localist agenda can provide the new housing the nation needs.

Stewart Baseley, Executive Chairman of the Home Builders Federation:

> ""The country is facing an acute housing crisis and it is imperative we have a planning system that delivers sufficient land for the homes we need. The New Homes Bonus is a crucial part of any new incentive based structure and a simple, easy to understand system is essential.""

Councillor Jim Hakewill, Leader - Kettering Borough Council:

> ""What I particularly like about the New Homes Bonus Scheme is that it is a direct and clear reward to local people who embrace growth. Local people want to see the growth dividend in their locality and this scheme delivers that.""

John Tutte, Group Managing Director, Redrow plc:

> ""Redrow welcomes any incentive to address the chronic shortage of new homes brought about by failures in the planning system to deliver housing in areas of most need. We believe the New Homes Bonus is a practical solution that will encourage many local authorities to grant more planning permissions for new homes. In response to the announcement of the bonus, we are already working with a number of local authorities to bring forward much-needed new housing.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2057628,Grant Shapps launches £420 million fund to get Britain building again in 2012,"Thousands of desperately needed homes will be built across the country thanks to a £420 million fund to unlock stalled sites and get Britain building again in 2012, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The Get Britain Building Fund will help get builders back on housing sites with planning permission that have been shut down because of difficulties in accessing development finance. This move will help towards getting the homes the country needs built and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. 

Over the next two years, this £420 million fund is expected to unlock up to 16,000 homes on sites that are currently stalled, and help create up to 30,000 jobs in construction and related industries.

Developers will be able to apply for a share of the funding, whether as a loan at commercial rates or as an equity investment - where the Government invests alongside the developer.

But Mr Shapps made clear that a top priority will be to deliver value for money and to make every taxpayer's pound works harder - as well as ensuring that projects that are backed by the fund fit in with local priorities.

So today Mr Shapps launched a competition to ensure these Government funds are focused on those projects that will unlock the most homes and jobs for the money, and offer the greatest prospects for recovering the investment.

The amount individual developers receive from the fund will be no more than 50 per cent of a project's total costs and all projects must restart on site by December next year. 

All homes funded through Get Britain Building must be completed by December 2014 - so developers applying for the funding must also have sites with outline planning permission, and the support of the local council.

But Mr Shapps also highlighted that while all developers will be able to apply for funding, he is working hard to make it accessible to small and medium-sized businesses, as they struggle most with accessing development finance. Developments put forward for funding can be as small as 25 new homes and the process has been streamlined to ensure that potential applicants are not put-off by onerous information requirements.

The Get Britain Building fund is one of a number of measures contained in the Housing Strategy, aimed at tackling the housing shortage, boosting the economy, creating jobs and giving people an opportunity to get on the housing ladder.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Across the country housing projects, backed by local people, have been stalled due to the difficult economic situation, while these local communities have been left with an ongoing and pressing need for more homes.
> 
> ""The £420 million Getting Britain Building Fund will change this, unlocking these developments to get workers back on site and construction back on track to build up to 16,000 homes that would otherwise never get finished. And to ensure businesses of all sizes can apply, I've ensured that applying for Get Britain Building has been made as straightfoward as possible to ensure developers are not asked to wade through unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy.
> 
> ""This is not a simple handout - the taxpayer will get a return on their investment, with the homes the country needs built and 30,000 jobs created. And because developers will be expected to pay back the money once their projects are completed, we will be able to continue unlocking sites for even more homes across the country.""

Homes and Communities Agency Chief Executive, Pat Ritchie, said:

> ""This is an exciting new programme, which will boost the house building industry, local economies and the supply of new homes for the areas that need them. I'm sure this opportunity will be of interest to all developers, but we have made the process is as simple as possible to make it easy for smaller developers to bid.
> 
> ""I am looking forward to receiving the expressions of interest from the industry and the Homes and Communities Agency will be taking a robust commercial approach working with local authorities to invest in the right schemes that deliver the greatest benefits for local communities and the industry.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1799890,Grant Shapps launches crackdown on housing fraud,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today launched a new national crackdown on tenancy cheats who unlawfully sublet their council or housing association properties and deny homes to people who really need them.

At least 50,000 social homes in England are being unlawfully occupied - providing the equivalent number of new social homes would cost more than £5 billion, and it is estimated that the number of unlawfully occupied properties ranges from one in 100 in some parts of the country to more than one in 20 social homes in some inner London boroughs.

Tenancy cheats live elsewhere, but can earn thousands of pounds a year charging higher rents for their social homes. If caught, these cheats lose their tenancy and can lose their right to a social home in future.

Those living in these homes may not know about the fraud, but fewer than 5 per cent of those evicted once their 'landlord's' fraud is detected subsequently apply to the council as homeless - they often find alternative accommodation in the private rented sector.

Mr Shapps today announced that the 51 councils doing the most to tackle this menace will receive a share of £19 million to bolster their efforts - which can include dedicated housing officers to investigate allegations, and tenancy audits to ensure the lawful tenants are living in the property.

He outlined how he is looking to back all councils across the country with a dedicated national action team, based at the Chartered Institute of Housing which will be available to offer practical support and advice to local authorities looking to tackle tenancy fraud in their area.

The Minister also said he is looking to lower the cost of using the services of credit reference agencies to help identify potential cheats. The Government is working with the National Fraud Authority to develop standard contracts for councils to agree with credit reference agencies, at standard prices, to lower the costs of using their services.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Tenancy fraud costs this country billions of pounds, but it's not just the money that's wasted The Housing Waiting list has doubled and tenancy fraud means that tens-of-thousands of people who could otherwise be housed are losing out because of cheats. We cannot afford to ignore this problem.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm launching a national crackdown, bolstering the efforts of councils across the country with £19million Government cash. I'm also going to back them further with a dedicated national action team to help tackle tenancy fraud.
> 
> ""The start of today's campaign is part of a wider Government effort to ensure council homes go to those who need them most. That's why I've launched plans for the biggest shake up in social housing for a generation, including the introduction of more flexible tenancies and greater fairness in the way social homes are allocated.""

Sarah Webb, Chief Executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said:

> ""We are delighted to be leading the sector in ensuring they have the professional advice and practical guidance to help them make more of their existing social housing. The new advice team that will be based at CIH will be made up of professionals who can support other professionals in local councils and housing associations to tackle illegal subletting and make the most of existing social housing.
> 
> ""We have also issued a new guide on tackling housing tenancy fraud with the National Fraud Authority today, which brings together examples of initiatives that really work and will help more housing providers ensure social housing goes to those in genuine need.""

Dr Bernard Herdan, CEO, National Fraud Authority said:

> ""Social housing is a valuable national asset which must be protected to provide homes for those who need them the most. In a time where demand is outstripping supply, it is imperative we tackle the fraudsters denying low income families access to proper accommodation and profiting from unlawful subletting.
> 
> ""The NFA is dedicated to working with Government and local authorities to reduce the impact fraud has on the public sector and the impact it has on society.""

Councils are working alongside their local housing associations to identify tenancy cheats in their area and free up the homes for people who need them most. Recent examples of successful investigations include:

  * Ms K obtained a tenancy on a two-bedroomed flat from **Ealing Council** from January 1991 by using false papers and a false identity to prove she'd been made homeless by her landlady. Instead, for the next 18 years she continued to live in a property she owned while subletting the flat, and claiming housing and council tax benefits. When her unlawful subletting was discovered council officers took legal action against her, and she pleaded guilty to six charges under the Theft Act, and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. The judge also granted a confiscation order for £290,451, Ealing Council were awarded £76,697 in compensation and Ms K was ordered to pay £6,132 to cover prosecution costs. Ms K has already paid over £68,000 towards the amount she owes but if she fails to repay the full amount within 12 months her prison sentence will be increased to three years.
  * After making several visits to one of their properties in South East London, **Gallions Housing Association** eventually received a reply from a man claiming to be the brother of the tenant, Mr B, who he claimed was out at work. At a later visit, the man claiming to be Mr B produced a UK driving licence as proof of identity. However, the housing officers quickly established that the photograph on the licence bore little resemblance to that in the records held on Mr B by Gallions. Further inquiries revealed that the real Mr B had been living in Baltimore, USA, for some time. The individual living at the property admitted he was a friend of Mr B's. Mr B contacted investigators and agreed to sign a tenancy termination notice, returning the property to Gallions Housing Association for a family in need.
  * Housing officers at **Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council** discovered one of their homes being offered to rent through a local letting agency. When they visited the address, they discovered that a local businessman was living there paying £300 a week rent to the person holding the tenancy, Mr L. The council took legal action, and Mr L was ordered to pay £7,179.52 - which included costs, rent arrears and the £2,993.70 profit he made while sub-letting the property.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1908030,Grant Shapps makes housing our heroes a priority,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has said that members of the Armed Forces will, from now on, be given top priority for housing help.

The dramatic move comes following a Military Covenant Housing Summit chaired by the Housing Minister on Monday and means that serving members of the Armed Forces, as well as those recently retired, will be able to benefit from a £400 million nationwide scheme aimed at helping 10,000 families buy a new home.

The Minister has also signalled that the Government will go even further by ensuring that all Low Cost Home Ownership schemes will now routinely place members of the Armed Forces at the top of their priority lists. And that Government housing agents will be instructed to go out and actively recruit military personnel for such schemes.

The news comes in addition to work between the Government, credit agencies and Royal Mail to ensure that those living on a base or serving abroad are not disadvantaged when applying for a mortgage.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This Government is not in the business of giving out pointless sympathy or hand outs. Instead we're pulling out all the stops to give our brave armed forces a helping hand onto the property ladder.
> 
> ""So I can confirm that military personnel are being promoted - instead of being just one of the priority groups for schemes like FirstBuy, they will now become the absolute top priority.
> 
> ""Our armed forces are being moved to the very front of the queue. And when the first keys to these new FirstBuy homes are handed over in September, I want to ensure that the brave and loyal men and women who serve in our armed forces, and have put their lives on the line to preserve our freedom and way of life, have had an opportunity to benefit.
> 
> ""But that's not the end of the story - until now we've had a mad situation where living on a base or serving abroad has disadvantaged people in the armed forces applying for a mortgage. So the Government will also be working with credit reference agencies and Royal Mail to ensure that this is no longer the case.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1646949,Grant Shapps meets Essendon's junior architects with designs on their village,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps this week visited Essendon, the birthplace for his vision for protecting rural villages for generations to come.

The Minister visited the local primary school, which this year had a pupil intake of less than 10. He saw the first efforts of budding architects and village planners as local schoolchildren showed him drawings of the dream houses they would want to see built in Essendon.

Mr Shapps was in the village to explain how, thanks to cutting red tape, a new right will allow people in rural villages to choose what is built in their area, helping to make sure that children who live there are protected against unwanted development in the future.

### A Community's Right to Build

The 'Community Right to Build' will allow local people and communities across England to decide where to create new homes, shops business and facilities where they want them and where they are needed, not where local councils and central government think they should be and free from unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Far from the Nimbyism that often hits the headlines, up and down the country there are entire communities willing and eager to give the go-ahead for new developments in their area. The countryside must be a vibrant place to live, and cannot be allowed to become a museum. I want to give communities the power to preserve their villages, which are currently struggling to survive because of a shortage of affordable homes.""

Community Right to Build has the backing of celebrity builder and TV presenter Tommy Walsh. He said:

> ""I've worked with people on community projects for many years, and in that time I've found that no one knows the needs of the community better than the people who live there.
> 
> ""Whether it's building affordable housing to allow young people to remain in their village, housing for the elderly, new schools or even business developments to keep the community vibrant - if it's what the community wants, it should be made easier for them to do it. Any moves to cut red tape and help local people will certainly be welcomed by me.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1876904,"Grant Shapps offers 'Build Now, Pay Later' deal to developers","Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today offered developers a Build Now, Pay Later deal to get work started on thousands of new homes without facing the expense of buying the land upfront.

He published details of the first sites to be made available under Build Now, Pay Later, an innovative scheme designed to give a shot in the arm to housebuilders that have struggled to get their developments up and running.

Under Build Now, Pay Later, housebuilders pay for the land after they have started work on the new homes, offering a lifeline to those struggling with cash flow problems and enabling them to start building straight away.

Over the past decade, housebuilding slumped to its lowest levels for any peacetime year since 1924. Today, the Minister insisted that making this land available could offer a huge boost to the numbers of homes being built and jobs supported.

So Mr Shapps has announced moves by the first Government agency to bring some of its surplus land forward under this programme.

Today, the Homes and Communities Agency is leading the way, offering the first six sites for development, many of which will be possible under Build Now, Pay Later. These sites could lead to as many as 3,000 new homes being built and as many as 18,000 jobs in construction and related industries being supported.

Up to 40 per cent of land suitable for housing development - as much as 7,500 hectares - is ""sitting idle"" in public sector land banks. It is estimated that making this land available owned by central Government alone could help developers build more than 60,000 new homes over 10 years.

So to ensure these sites are the first of many to be made available, Government departments from across Whitehall will publish their own plans to release land - and will be held to account for the numbers of homes and jobs created as a result.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Draconian top-down targets brought housebuilding to its knees, reaching the lowest level for any peacetime year since 1924. Radical reform is needed to give a boost to developers and kickstart building so we can get the homes this country needs.
> 
> ""Up to 40 per cent of the land ready for development in this country is simply sitting idle in the hands of the public sector. So today I'm giving the green light to the Homes and Communities Agency to lead the way by making six new sites available for development.
> 
> ""These will be the first of many sites as all Government departments will now be asked to make land available for housebuilding and, crucially, will be held accountable for the homes built and jobs supported through this. And many of these sites will be available under Build Now, Pay Later, giving builders access to land they only pay for once the homes are built and giving a boost to the level of housebuilding in this country.""

Pat Ritchie, chief executive at the Homes and Communities Agency, said:

> ""We are leading the way by making more land available for development through a range of options that will help developers get on site more quickly and help communities access the homes, amenities and public space needed in their local area.""

Speaking in advance of today's Home Builders Federation Policy conference, executive chairman Stewart Baseley said:

> ""The Government simply must address the acute housing supply crisis. The public sector owns around 40 per cent of potential residential land, and so moves to release surplus land for development are a positive step and we need to see the process quickly accelerated.""

### Notes to editors

The six sites being released by the Homes and Communities Agency are:

#### Hemel Hempsted

Planning consent is in place for 372 homes, known as Cherry Tree Lane, as part of the Spencer's Park development site - a site partly owned by Crown Estates. This phase of HCA-owned land will be brought forward for disposal and development by the Agency. The disposal will test Build Now, Pay Later options including payment for land on sale of homes or staged payments. This approach could trail the way for other HCA-owned land in the area.

#### Park Prewett, Basingstoke

David Wilson Homes has been announced as the preferred developer to work with the Homes and Communities Agency, Basingstoke and Dearne Borough Council and the local community to complete the final tranche on the redevelopment of a former hospital site, with up to 585 homes. The site will be delivered through the Build Now, Pay Later scheme.

#### Blackwall Reach, Tower Hamlets

Owned by Tower Hamlets Council, the development has been underway since 2007 with plans to demolish the 1960s Robin Hood Gardens housing estate currently on the site. The new plans include creating over 1,600 new homes, nearly 700 of which will be affordable. Construction work will involve a partnership between the Council, the Homes and Communities Agency and the developers Swan/Countryside, with the land sold under the new Build Now, Pay Later scheme.

#### Ransome Road, Northampton

The Homes and Communities Agency has brought together land owned by organisations including Northampton Borough Council and Network Rail to create a 23-hectare brownfield site close to the town centre, which is suitable for 450 homes, with plans for a further 800 homes once a new road link has been built. Working with organisations including the local councils and development corporation and the Environment Agency, the Homes and Communities Agency has made a number of improvements to the site to enable development, including improved road junctions and flood defences.

#### Cotgrave, Rushcliffe, Nottinghamshire

Plans include the development of a 4.6-hectare former colliery site being made available under Build Now Pay Later, with plans for 470 new homes and regeneration of the town centre. The land is owned by organisations including Rushcliffe Borough Council and the local Police Authority. The land will be available through Build Now, Pay Later.

#### Croppings, Lightmoor, Telford

Developers Keepmoat have been announced as the preferred developer of a site at Lightmoor Village, to build 100 new homes under Build Now, Pay Later. This is part of a wider development of the village - 230 new homes and a new primary school have already been built, as well as a new village centre. A further 370 new homes are expected over the next three years.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2120120,Grant Shapps offers 'Portas-Plus' plan to revive ailing high streets,"Towns across the country have got their applications in ahead of today's deadline in the hope of becoming Portas Pilots. Ministers revealed the unexpectedly high level of interest whilst announcing that the Government is accepting virtually all the recommendations put forward by Mary Portas last December.

The Government today is for the first time issuing its formal response to the Portas High Street Review. Grant Shapps confirmed Ministers are accepting the vast majority of Mary's recommendations - but that they intend to go further with a raft of new incentives, funding schemes and bureaucracy-busting measures, all in a bid to rejuvenate the country's rundown high streets.

  * [""Portas-Plus"" deal for High Streets - Transcript](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/word/2120049.doc)

MS Word, 24 kb

In what Mr Shapps referred to as a 'Portas-Plus' response, a new package of help has been drawn up including:

  * A multi-million pound High Street Innovation Fund - kick started by £10 million of taxpayers money focussed on bringing empty shops back into use - which, if supplemented by both councils and landlords, could see £30 million going to support new business start-ups whilst bringing empty High Street properties back into use;
  * A £1 million Future High Street X-Fund, which will be awarded in a year's time to the locations which deliver the most creative and effective schemes to revitalise their high streets;
  * A National Markets Day, launching a National Markets Fortnight, to celebrate the role markets can play, help aspiring entrepreneurs try out their business ideas, and encourage more visitors to town centres;
  * A £500,000 fund for Business Improvement Districts, to help Town Centres access loans for their set-up costs; and
  * Launching a further round of Portas Pilots, to trial some of Mary's recommendations and come up with new ideas to breathe life into underused high streets. This is in response to the massive interest from hundreds of locations across the country, sparked by the competition for the first wave of 12 pilots launched last month.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today, I'm accepting virtually all of the recommendations from Mary Portas's review - but I'm also going that one step further, offering a 'Portas-Plus' deal, with a range of measures designed to help local people turn their high streets into the beating hearts of their communities once again.
> 
> ""Mary Portas's review made crystal clear the stark challenge our high streets face. With Internet shopping and out-of-town centres here to stay, they must offer something new if they are to entice visitors back.
> 
> ""Her report has provided the catalyst for change that many towns have been craving. I now want to see people coming together to form their own town teams and turning their creative ideas into reality to ensure their high streets thrive long into the future.""

Mary Portas said:

> ""When I published my Review I was clear that this was an action plan for our high streets, not a document to gather dust on Whitehall shelves.
> 
> ""I've been thrilled by the response of people, Town Teams and communities up and down the country, who have seized this opportunity to come together and form their own ideas. I'm pleased that the response from Grant Shapps today is designed to build on this momentum and give local people the tools they need to turn their creative ideas into reality, along with extra money to bring empty shops back into use.
> 
> ""Naturally I would have liked greater central intervention in critical areas such as change of use, parking, business rates and the sign off of new out of town developments and I will continue to fight for these, but I do believe that today marks the first day of a fresh new approach, putting our high streets firmly back on the public and national agenda.""  


Martin Blackwell, chief executive at the Association of Town Centre Management, said:

> ""We all recognise that the high street in 10 or even five years will be radically different to that we see today. This Government's approach, shown in the response to Mary's report, is giving local communities the opportunity to shape the future High Street they want to see in their town.""

British Retail Consortium Director of Business, Tom Ironside, said:

> ""We're pleased to note the Government's made a common sense decision not to seek to restrict consumer choice in other retail locations. Avoiding imposing an exceptional sign off for out of town developments is the right approach. We also welcome the money which has been made available to enable the development of Business Improvement Districts and the steps which are being taken to reduce red tape that affects the high street. These detailed measures will be beneficial.
> 
> ""Retailers retain their concerns in relation to the excessive burden of business rates and the need for concrete action to ensure affordability, clarity and certainty for the future. We hope the Government will return to this issue soon.""

Responding to the first recommendation in the review, Mr Shapps said he wanted to see hundreds of Town Teams - made up of key players in the local area including the council, local landlords, business owners and local MPs - being formed and mobilised across the country to drive forward the necessary change.

He encouraged these Town Teams to consider:

  * How their high streets can become the ""beating heart of the community"", offering more than just retail with entertainment venues and leisure facilities, as well as housing and local public services;

  * How they can work with councils to use the forthcoming new powers to offer local business rate discounts, and to ensure businesses are aware of the option to spread the payment of the retail price index increase in business rates bills over three years, giving them the flexibility to manage their bills and help their cash- flow. This is in addition to Small Business Rate Relief, which in England has been doubled for two and a half years, from 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2013;

  * How they could stimulate a vibrant evening economy by encouraging local shops to open later, offering a service to people as they come home from work, instead of people resorting to online shopping; and

  * How they could make more imaginative and exciting use of public spaces and remove street clutter to make town centres more pleasant for visitors.

And confirming the Government was accepting a number of other key recommendations to cut red tape and entice motorists to the town centre, Mr Shapps gave a commitment to:

  * Help councils revoke unnecessary and archaic byelaws through a new streamlined process - enabling  outdated rules hindering efforts to get new markets and businesses up and running to be swiftly scrapped;
  * Reform current planning rules to allow the conversion of space above shops to two flats, rather than the current limit of one; and
  * Consult on abolishing centrally-set minimum parking charges, to give councils the flexibility to levy lower parking penalty notices if they choose. The Government will also take steps to ensure greater transparency on parking charges to introduce greater competition between town centres.

3. The ""Love Your Local Market"" event will take place on 23 June 2012, designed to encourage more people to visit the high street and see what is on offer. This event, run by the National Association of British Market Authorities with support from the rest of the markets sector, including the Markets Alliance and the National Markets Traders Federation, will also give aspiring entrepreneurs the offer of a ""table for a tenner"", giving them the opportunity to try out their own business ideas.

4. Small Business Rate Relief in England has been doubled for two and a half years, from 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2013. Eligible businesses occupying property with a rateable value of up to £6,000 pay no rates for that period, with tapering relief up to a rateable value to £12,000. To make sure no small firm loses out the Localism Act has simplified the process for claiming the tax break to encourage take up by small businesses. More information is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972672](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972672).

5. In addition businesses will be able to defer payment of 3.2 per cent of their 2012-13 rates bills until 2013-14 and 2014-15. This will give businesses flexibility to manage their rates bills in the current economic climate, help their cashflow, and give them time to adjust to the impact of inflation. This means someone with a bill of a £10,000 could defer £320.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1664293,Grant Shapps offers social housing tenants the freedom to take control,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps is offering England's eight million social housing tenants the opportunity to take control of where they want to live and their life opportunities. The new 'freedom pass' will allow tenants to move home for work, to be closer to family or for any other reason.

The Minister will introduce a new National Affordable Home Swap Scheme, which will mean that for the first time tenants will be able to see details of other tenants in council and housing association homes looking for a mutual exchange - not just in their own area, but across the country.

Mr Shapps will also work with two London boroughs - Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham - to explore whether they can offer a new Right to Move so some tenants could ask their landlord to find them a home in the area they want to live.

The measures are aimed at improving the chances for tenants to move - in 2008, fewer than a quarter of all new lettings went to existing tenants. Those looking to move can face an uphill battle, often having to pit themselves against the record 1.8million people on social housing waiting lists.

This boost for tenants comes as Prime Minister David Cameron kicked off a debate about ways of improving the system for new tenancies, and how best to help the most vulnerable in our society. The Prime Minister made clear Government's commitment to protecting the security of tenure and rights of those currently in social housing.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today I'm launching a 'Freedom Pass' for all 8m people in affordable housing in England. Social housing should provide more than a roof over people's heads - it should lift them out of poverty, and free them to take chances to improve the quality of their own lives.  Instead, many tenants are left trapped in their own homes, while councils and housing associations turn their attention to record waiting lists.
> 
> ""This cannot continue - as we work to tackle the record budget deficit we must ensure vulnerable people benefit from, but don't become trapped by, the safety net that social housing provides.
> 
> ""That's why I'm putting tenants in the driving seat, with a new opportunity to see people like them looking to exchange social homes not just in their area but across the country, through a new National Home Swap Scheme.""

Commenting on how Government is taking a fresh look at security of tenure for new social housing tenants Grant Shapps added:

> ""It is quite clear that the real losers from the current system are the 1.8m people on council house waiting lists who the current arrangements do not help. It is time to consider whether our affordable housing system can be better used and whether one of the benefits would be greater social mobility. This will have no impact on existing council or housing association tenants.""

",04-Aug-10,improving-the-rented-housing-sector,,,,grant-shapps,,,,
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1643936,Grant Shapps outlines government support for struggling homeonwers,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today outlined how the Coalition Government will provide much-needed support to homeowners at risk of repossession.

The risk of repossessions remains high - the Council of Mortgage Lenders' latest forecast is that there will be 53,000 repossessions in 2010. So Mr Shapps is also stepping up work with partner organisations including Citizens Advice and Shelter to help promote the help available to struggling homeowners.

And today, he welcomed the support of Martin Lewis, creator of [www.moneysavingexpert.com](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com) (external link), for the ongoing effort to encourage more struggling homeowners to seek early help and advice with their mortgage worries.

But the Minister also emphasised that the most effective thing the Government is doing to help homeowners is to tackle the record deficit and prevent the need for rapid increases in interest rates.

One of Mr Shapps's first tasks since becoming Housing Minister has been to take a fresh look at Communities and Local Government schemes which provide help to homeowners facing difficulty in paying their mortgage, making sure they offer the best deal for them and value for money for taxpayers.

With this in mind, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme will be refocused to delivery better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to Housing Associations and tighter caps on property price and repair costs.

Using their knowledge of the needs of their communities, councils will help to deliver the scheme alongside their local housing associations to ensure that the scheme is targeted at homeowners who are most likely to benefit from it.

The longer term role for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme will be considered through the Spending Review.

Since its launch in April 2009, the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme has only helped 34 people although research to be published shortly shows that it has had a positive impact on lender forbearance practice and mortgage arrears management. However, given the low administrative costs, the Minister has decided that it will remain in place as a backstop scheme that maybe needed if interest rates rise. It will close as planned at the end of the financial year.

This follows the decision announced in the Budget to move support for mortgage interest paid to a rate that provides better value for money for the taxpayer, by applying the Bank of England published average mortgage rate as the standard interest rate from October.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The most effective thing the Government can do for homeowners is to tackle the record deficit and avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates. But there must still be effective help on hand for those struggling to pay their mortgages.
> 
> ""So today I can confirm that the Mortgage Rescue Scheme and Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme remain available as a last resort to homeowners facing the real threat of repossession.
> 
> ""But the most effective thing anyone with money worries can do is to not bury their heads in the sand, seek early advice and speak to their lender to avoid losing their home. I would urge people to visit [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link), or contact organisations like Citizens Advice or Shelter for free advice on taking control of their finances.""

Independent Moneysavingexpert Martin Lewis said:

> ""Mortgage repossession's a catastrophic threat for struggling families, and anything that's done to help them ride it out is crucial. The most important rule is get help as soon as possible - fighting repossession when they're coming for your house is a too late, instead act as soon as you spot the potential for trouble and possible arrears.
> 
> ""The help at hand means some who qualify will have their mortgage interest paid for them, others will be allowed to postpone paying both through official government scheme and improved lender leniency and a few may have their house part bought.
> 
> ""So the golden rule is if you're in trouble speak to your lender asap and a non profit agency like Citizens advice or National Debline for help plus visit [www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgagearrears](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgagearrears) (external link) and [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) and you may find its easier to start sleeping at night.""

A separate report by Professor John Muellbauer and Dr Janine Aron of Oxford University published today shows that the combination of greater tolerance from lenders and Government schemes on offer has had a notable effect in helping homeowners. This report also warns that the risk of increased numbers of repossessions will remain high in the years ahead.

An independent evaluation of the schemes by a team led by Professor Steve Wilcox from the Centre for Housing Policy (University of York) and the School of the Built Environment (Heriot Watt University) is due to be published shortly showing that there is widespread support for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme from partners and borrowers and that its continuation would remain beneficial at a lower grant rate. And on the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme, the report shows that it has been found to have influenced the extent to which lenders have offered greater tolerance and patience to those in arrears, and that there was a case for it continuing until the housing market had recovered.

The Department's schemes are part of a comprehensive range of help and advice for struggling homeowners.

Anyone with mortgage worries can go to [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) where they can get impartial advice, find out the steps they can take to keep their home and prepare an action plan to tackle their own finances. Free debt advice is also available from organisations including Citizens Advice, Shelter and National Debtline.

The Financial Services Authority has also recently introduced tough new rules on lenders so repossession remains the last resort, and so those in arrears who have come to an agreement on repayment are treated fairly.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/16527871,Grant Shapps outlines local approach to delivering zero carbon homes from 2016,"Councils and developers could be given much more flexibility to meet ambitious eco-standards to ensure all new homes are zero carbon from 2016, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

It comes as part of the Coalition Government's ambition for an eco-friendly economy and to become the greenest government ever.

The Minister has said he will look at ways builders could make payments to fund community energy projects, such as wind farms and district heating schemes, to meet their obligations to reduce carbon emissions from new homes - this could give developers and councils more freedom and flexibility to decide how to meet their zero-carbon obligations.

Minimum standards for energy efficiency measures such as cavity wall insulation will also be set through future revisions to building regulations. These will be based on those revisions outlined in a recent consultation on the Code for Sustainable Homes, which set key benchmarks for the sustainability of new homes.

Mr Shapps also confirmed the allocation of £600,000 to the Zero Carbon Hub to continue its work this year. The Hub has also been tasked with testing new benchmarks for carbon emission reductions.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""This is about meeting tough environmental standards, but not dictating how every home should be built. Councils and developers together are in the best position to decide how best to meet these standards, so we are looking at giving them the flexibility and a range of options to do this.
> 
> ""We are committed to all new homes being zero-carbon from 2016, and have the right mix of measures in place.
> 
> ""First and foremost a zero carbon home must use as little energy as possible, which is why I will shortly announce a minimum standard for key energy efficiency measures like loft and cavity wall insulation.
> 
> ""And to ensure the benchmark for carbon emission reductions is both ambitious and achievable, I look forward to seeing the results of tests the Zero Carbon Hub will conduct over the next few months.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1732284,Grant Shapps outlines plans for new council housing deal,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today committed to giving councils the financial freedom they need to offer a better deal to the four million people living in council housing in England.

Describing the current system of council house financing as ""no longer fit for purpose"", Mr Shapps set out plans to replace it with a new, more transparent system that devolves greater power to councils to better meet the housing needs of their local communities. This delivers a commitment in the Coalition Agreement.

Under the current system, councils are required to pay council house rents and the majority of receipts from any sales of land or homes to Whitehall, who then decide how best to redistribute it back to councils.

But under the proposed new rules, rather than the current Housing Revenue Account subsidy system councils would instead keep all the rents and sales receipts they collect.

In return for this greater freedom, some councils would take on additional housing debt - but no council will take on a level of debt that is not sustainable for the long term.

Details of the new system will be announced as part of the Spending Review on 20 October and will be introduced as part of the Localism Bill being introduced this autumn.

These reforms can only be effectively delivered through a comprehensive and legally binding settlement achieved through primary legislation. The minister is therefore ruling out a voluntary deal ahead of securing the powers in the Localism Bill.

In the period leading up to implementation of the new system, the overall approach for transfer proposals that have yet to be put to a tenant ballot will be a value for money and delivery test against the costs and benefits of the reformed system.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long councils have been left hamstrung in their efforts to meet the housing needs of their residents by a council house finance system that is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. The Housing Revenue Account subsidy is in urgent need of reform.
> 
> ""That's why I can confirm that we intend to scrap the current system, and instead replace it with something more transparent that will serve the needs of local communities without interference from Whitehall.
> 
> ""Subject to the Comprehensive Spending Review we will offer councils the opportunity to keep the rents they collect and the receipts from any house or land sales. This is a key step to transfer powers to councils and communities, so they are free to improve their local services in a way that best meets the needs of local people.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1737459,Grant Shapps pledge to cut red tape on builders,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today pledged to put the full weight of the new Coalition Government behind cutting red tape and making it easier for developers to get projects started and the homes the country needs built.

He highlighted the steps the Government are already taking to tackle the key obstacles house-builders currently face, and future plans to cut red tape and make it easier and less costly for them to get building work underway.

The Minister pledged to tackle the 'alphabet soup' of standards and red tape that blight efforts to start new developments, and will call on industry leaders to work with Government in a new drive to simplify the system.

This work to cut red tape will complement the ongoing review of building regulations launched by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell earlier this year. 

The review is in addition to a groundbreaking new 'One In, One Out' system which began last month, where Ministers seeking to introduce new regulations that will impose costs on business have to identify current regulations of equivalent value that can be removed.

Mr Shapps also highlighted Government efforts to bring an end to the conflicts of the past between developers and residents with the introduction of a New Homes Bonus, so that those communities going for growth now and in the future will receive direct and substantial extra funding to spend as they wish.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Last year, housebuilding hit its lowest level for any peacetime year since 1924 as developers have been hampered by regional targets that put them in direct conflict with local communities and an alphabet soup of regulations and red tape they have to navigate.
> 
> ""Today I have a clear message to housebuilders large and small - we are on your side. I am determined to make it easier to build the homes this country needs.  Appropriate building standards, applied sensibly, help developers and communities alike, but they can only be effective if they are easier to understand. That's why I want to simplify the process for housebuilders to meet the standards communities demand.
> 
> ""But I also want to make it easier for these companies to complete new developments where they are wanted. That's why we will introduce powerful new incentives so those communities that give the green light to developments see the benefits of the new homes in their area.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1763151,Grant Shapps pledges to shut the door to squatters,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today pledged to shut the door to squatters by making homeowners as aware of their rights as those looking to take over their properties.

Mr Shapps has launched an online guide for homeowners setting out their rights and what to do if their property is invaded.

There are an estimated 20,000 squatters in the UK. Recent high profile examples of  homeowners who have fallen victim to squatters taking over their homes include Connan Gupta, whose home in Camberwell, South London, was taken over by squatters after he'd moved out while repairs were being made; and 72-year-old George Pope, whose home in Barking was taken over by squatters while he stayed with friends.

The guidance, produced jointly with the Ministry of Justice, makes clear that it is an offence for a squatter to fail to leave a residential property when required to do so by or on behalf of either a displaced residential occupier or certain other occupiers whose interest in the premises is protected under the legislation.

Anyone looking to remove squatters from their home can also apply for an Interim Possession Order. This requires squatters to leave the property within 24 hours of the order being served, or they are committing a criminal offence and can be arrested and face up to six months' imprisonment.

It is also then an offence for the squatter to return to the property within 12 months of the Interim Possession Order being served.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Recent high profile cases have served to illustrate the distress and misery that squatters can cause. I want to shut the door to squatters once and for all, and for homeowners to know their rights just as well as those looking to take over their properties.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm publishing advice making clear how the law is on their side, and that there are steps they can take to take back their home quickly and effectively.""

Across the country, thousands of volunteers are working alongside charity and council workers to provide short-term emergency shelters for vulnerable people during the cold weather.

Mr Shapps, who himself slept rough on Christmas Eve 2007 to help highlight the plight of homeless people, paid tribute to the fantastic job charities such as Shelter and Crisis are doing at helping people keep out the cold, and the willingness of volunteers to give up their time in order to make sure needy people have somewhere warm to stay and a hot meal at Christmas.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Christmas is a time when most people will be gathering together with families and friends in the warmth of their homes - but for the hundreds of people across the country who are sleeping rough in the cold, this is a time when the hardship of their situation becomes even worse.
> 
> ""That's why we are one hundred per cent behind the charities running these shelters to keep people off the streets, and we are backing up our support with cash. There's no reason why anyone should spend Christmas outdoors in the cold, so I urge anyone who is worried about a homeless person they've seen sleeping outside to contact their local council or your local homelessness charity.
> 
> ""But homelessness is not just an issue at Christmas - it's a year round problem and the charities, councils and volunteers providing services for homeless people need our support. That's why we've made a long-term commitment to work closely with colleagues across Government and the charitable sector through the Ministerial Working Group on homelessness, and protected £400m of grant funding that will be used to tackle homelessness over the next four years.""

Anyone with concerns about homeless people seen sleeping outside in the cold weather should contact their local authority or your local homelessness charity.

Re - Daily Mail, 22 February - Want to hang out the bunting? You'll need to take a survey

It is disappointing to hear that a small minority of councils are putting obstacles in the way of people wanting to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee with their neighbours. This is a great opportunity for local residents from all backgrounds to come together, and reinforce our shared identity and sense of Britishness. The Government has cut red tape on street parties, by reining back in the complicated bureaucracy of forms, permissions and risk assessments. Councils must play their part too - and councillors should exercise their powers to clamp down on municipal killjoys in their town halls.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1988116,Grant Shapps responds to article in Financial Times on homelessness,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps responds to an article in the Financial Times on homelessness and housing benefits.

Dear Sir,

It is misleading to directly attribute the increase in homelessness shown in yesterday's figures to the changes to Housing Benefit introduced in April (_Homelessness increasing as the recession and cuts bite_, 9 September). Households already claiming Housing Benefit have been given 9 months additional protection before the changes take place.

Families are still feeling the effects of the worst recession for a generation. We've maintained the £400 million homelessness grant funding, and I would urge anyone facing the threat of homelessness to seek help as soon as possible.

And far from ""weakening the safety net function of the social rented sector"", we're introducing new flexibilities so councils and housing associations can better meet the needs of their new tenants by offering fixed term tenancies to give them the help they need, for as long as they need it. We're also investing in delivering more homes - our £4.5 billion Affordable Housing programme is set to exceed original expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes.

But cutting the Housing Benefit bill is essential to cutting the deficit, which we must do if we're to prevent the need for rapid increases in interest rates. It is also in the interests of all taxpayers who also have to work hard and pay taxes to support a system which can currently lead to Housing Benefit allowing some to live in homes that ordinary working families could not themselves afford. Even after these reforms come into effect, a third of properties in each local area will still be available to those on benefits and councils will have £190 million available to help those in greatest need.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1975569,Grant Shapps' response to Guardian article about homelessness,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps responds to an article in the Guardian about homelessness.

When a family is made homeless or someone has no choice but to spend a night sleeping on the street, they become some of the most vulnerable people in our society. I am shocked and saddened when I see people bedding down for the night on our nation's streets, or hear of a family spending another night in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation.

Tackling homelessness and rough sleeping is what first got me into politics and as soon as I became Housing Minister I made clear this Government's commitment by protecting in its entirety the £400million to be spent tackling it over the next four years.

I found today's Guardian painted a rather alarmist picture of the forthcoming Crisis report. Homelessness remains at historically low levels. But it is perfectly true to say that there are pressures on the system, because the dreadful state of the economy that we inherited is feeding through into already stretched household budgets as people cope with the effects of unemployment and cutbacks at work. That is why it is so important that we are getting on with creating the conditions for growth and with cutting the huge public deficit.

To do this, we must rein in the spending that has got utterly out of control, which includes a housing benefit bill that has jumped by 50 per cent in the past five years. But I don't believe anyone need go without a home as a result of these reforms, and we are providing councils with an extra £190million to allow them to smooth the transition to the new benefit levels for those most affected; protecting those in the most vulnerable situations and preventing increased homelessness.

Homelessness is not just a problem of scale, it is also a problem of complexity - no two people lose their home for the same reason. In June this year the cross-ministerial group that I set up to address the underlying causes that lead to people losing their homes, delivered its first report and made key commitments to help some of the most vulnerable in our society into stable accommodation. Top of the list was a pledge that for the first time no one should ever need to experience a second night sleeping rough. An historic commitment that sadly newspapers, including the Guardian, could barely bother to report.

This groundbreaking work also highlighted how the most successful action to tackle homelessness is rooted in local communities - local authorities working together with local community groups, charities and businesses. And how we can only tackle homelessness and rough sleeping effectively if we are transparent about the scale of the problem. Incidentally, one of my first priorities as Housing Minister was to introduce a more accurate assessment of rough sleeping levels. I knew that this would lead to an apparent sharp rise in the numbers sleeping rough but how could anyone take seriously the previous system that claimed just 464 rough sleepers. To truly tackle the problem we first needed to properly measure rough sleeping and that's what we did by making the count more comprehensive.

The debt-fuelled trebling of house prices in the 10 years from 1997 has locked too many out of owning their own home. I want to see a period of house price stability so that more homes become affordable, and for that to happen we need to get Britain building again. That's why I've announced plans to release thousands of acres of public land for housebuilding, and have committed £4.5billion towards an Affordable Homes programme which, far from the claims made by Crisis, is set to exceed initial expectations and deliver up to 170,000 affordable homes by 2015. And make owning your own property a reality for far more people than before.

There are thousands of people up and down the country, working in local government and charities, helping people into a secure and stable home. Millions of people support their work and we should all be thankful for their dedication and compassion.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1683070,Grant Shapps scraps 'cosmetic' £5 million town hall surveys,"The Place Survey, one of the largest surveys in Europe carried out by local authorities, has been scrapped by Local Government Minister Grant Shapps to prevent cash being diverted from vital public services.

Introduced in 2008, the Place Survey is a postal survey conducted by every council in England. It involves asking questions of over half a million residents and is estimated to cost more than £5 million to run.

> ""These surveys are a cosmetic exercise which never change anything. Let's give real power back to the people - such as letting taxpayers veto high council tax rises.""

Results have been fed back to central Government and used to measure councils' performance on a range of centrally-imposed targets.

Fieldwork for this year's survey was due to take place by all councils between September and December this year - but the Minister has scrapped this.

Mr Shapps believes that the Place Survey was an example of wasteful municipal spending - which required council officials to ask residents a range of intrusive personal questions.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""These surveys are a cosmetic exercise which never change anything. Let's give real power back to the people - such as letting taxpayers veto high council tax rises.""

Scrapping the survey is part of concerted efforts by the new Government to release councils from Whitehall control - leaving them free to respond flexibly and effectively to the needs of their residents.

It follows the scrapping of Comprehensive Area Assessments by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles in June, instead making councils more accountable to residents rather than ministers in Whitehall.

The announcement also follows on from the new Government's plans to require councils to publish online their spending over £500; to stop Town Hall publications which compete with local newspapers; and to block the practice of councils and quangos hiring agencies to lobby Government.

St George's Crypt is a charity that has supported homeless people in Leeds since 1930. As well as accommodation, the Crypt is preparing to offer dental healthcare for residents, as well as valuable training opportunities.

During his visit - his second - Mr Shapps explained how he recently chaired the first meeting of homelessness ministers from eight Government departments, set up by the Prime Minister to step up action to help the homeless.

He also outlined how his plans to overhaul the flawed system of measuring homelessness will remove the mask on the true scale on the problem of rough sleeping.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1931361,Grant Shapps sends special agents into barracks to help our troops buy homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced special housing agents will be sent into military bases to help members of the armed forces get a foot on the housing ladder.

Housing agents will be dispatched to barracks across the country and abroad to help troops apply to buy a home under the £500m FirstBuy scheme, which will help over 10,000 households purchase a new build home over the next two years.

On the national day to celebrate the work of our armed forces, Mr Shapps confirmed military personnel will be the top priority to benefit from the nationwide scheme, and called on developers to also visit army bases and market their new build homes to the troops.

The move follows a military housing summit chaired by the Minister, where industry leaders and defence officials discussed what more can be done to help people serving in the military get a roof over their head and a place of their own.

Such was the appetite for helping military personnel buy their own homes that Mr Shapps immediately moved them to the top priority category for assistance through FirstBuy. Serving members of the Armed Forces, as well as those recently retired, will now be at the front of the queue to benefit from the scheme.

The Government is taking further steps to ensure that all Government-funded home ownership schemes routinely place members of the Armed Forces at the top of their priority lists.

Mr Shapps also signalled that prioritising military personnel will be extended to social housing. Rather than being forced to languish on waiting lists, service families in need of a social home should be given higher priority by councils.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's not enough to simply tell the troops they are a priority for the FirstBuy scheme and wish them luck. I want to make sure that military personnel have the best opportunity to benefit. That's why I am dispatching special housing agents to military bases and training camps as recruiting sergeants for the scheme, and we are encouraging developers to do the same. Troops will be told how they can benefit, and how they can apply to buy one of the thousands of new homes that will be made available over the next two years.
> 
> ""This Government believes in helping people who deserve it - none more so than the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our country. Our troops don't just want to hear a few kind words on Armed Forces Day - they want action. That's why I have promoted members of the armed forces so they will be the first to benefit from the Government's scheme to help people get a foot on the housing ladder.
> 
> ""The help for our heroes will not end there. Steps are being taken to make sure members of the armed forces are at the top of priority lists for all Government-funded home ownership schemes. We will also end unfair treatment of military personnel applying for social housing. No longer will the loyal service of our troops be rewarded with an extended period of languishing on council waiting lists. Instead, service families in need of a social home will be given proper priority, and will be treated with the dignity and respect that their selfless sacrifice deserves.""

Mike Farley, chief executive of Persimmon plc, commented:

> ""It is important that we give our Armed Forces a helping hand onto the property ladder. We are delighted to be able to support more than 2,100 troops and other first time buyers in the purchase of their new homes right across the country thanks to the government funding in the FirstBuy Scheme.""

Starting next month, developers will begin marketing homes under FirstBuy and qualifying households will be helped with a 20 per cent equity loan to buy a property from a participating house builder.

This comes in addition to work between the Government, credit agencies and Royal Mail to ensure that those living on a base or serving abroad are not disadvantaged when applying for a mortgage.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1602634,Grant Shapps sets out grand design for the future of green housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps joined eco-designer and broadcaster Kevin McCloud at his new eco-housing development in Swindon to set out his vision to get the green housing industry back on track.

### Zero carbon pledge

After many years of campaigning for greener standards in housing Mr Shapps announced the new Government would bring four years of consultation to a close and get the definition of a zero carbon home nailed down within weeks.

Mr Shapps also restated his support for all new homes to be zero carbon from 2016 to take effective action to reduce the 27 per cent of all UK emissions that come from homes.

Homes will have all round better insulated walls, windows, ceilings and floors to deliver the new energy efficiency standards, and will be able to use onsite renewables to reduce emissions.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""When we were in Opposition I said that I endorsed the concept of building all new homes to a zero carbon standard, and that remains my position. I know how important it is to industry to have a clear definition as soon as possible - so that house builders can buy land with confidence and start to design the homes of the future, and so that the supply chain can gear up production of the technologies that will be needed.
> 
> ""I will be publishing a final zero carbon definition in a matter of weeks so that the industry can get on and deliver the improved eco-friendly homes we need.""

### Community development

Mr Shapps met Mr McCloud and environmentalist Jonathan Porritt at the launch of The Triangle, a new community development inspired by Swindon's mid-Victorian railway cottages.

The scheme, by development company Hab Oakus with Housing Group Greensquare, received grant support from the Homes and Communities Agency and Department for Energy and Climate Change as well as research and development support from the Energy Saving Trust, and uses renewable materials such as Hempcrete for external walls and features communal green spaces as well as areas for residents to grow their own food.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1905496,Grant Shapps sets out practical solution to cut emissions from new homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced a tough but realistic definition for zero carbon homes that strikes the right balance between delivering the zero carbon homes for the future and creating the right conditions to get the homes the country needs built.

The Government's proposals for the Zero Carbon Homes standard - the standard to which all new homes started after 2016 must be built - will set tough new standards to ensure that new homes do not add to the country's carbon footprint.

Mr Shapps said that he rejected calls to make housebuilders anticipate the lifetime emissions of each property because it was not reasonable, and other measures are in place to reduce the carbon emissions from the actual use of houses. He said that ""they should not be responsible for the amount of television the families who buy their homes watch or the number of cups of tea they make each day"".

Instead, tough standards for fabric energy efficiency (insulation, glazing) will be included in future changes to the Building Regulations.

Mr Shapps also said that the Government will consult on the independent Zero Carbon Hub's recommendations on the levels for other on site carbon reduction levels, which might require renewable energy technologies to be used like solar panels. And he will confirm that a proposed regime for off-site measures like community energy schemes which deliver genuinely additional carbon savings would be introduced.

Key aspects of this will be to design a regime which will:

  * be made available to all developers operating in England;
  * be cost effective by ensuring offsite measures are no higher than the Government's long term value of carbon; and
  * ensure that any funds raised will be dedicated to carbon abatement.

The Government will also review the measures which can be supported under these approaches and will consult further with industry, local government and other partners on these.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We have delivered on our commitment to nail down a definition for zero carbon homes. This is an historic turning point in our drive to slash carbon emissions and tackle climate change. It paves the way for the green transformation of Britain's homes - making them warmer and more comfortable to live in, and at the same time cheaper to run.
> 
> ""And we have done this without piling unfair costs on housebuilders. The new definition will balance increased costs of house building with the social commitment we made to reduce our country's carbon footprint.
> 
> ""This approach is fairer and reaffirms the Government's commitment to reduce regulatory and other burdens on the house-building industry by March 2015. It also plays an important part in protecting the economic stability of the country.""

Housebuilders will now only be responsible for emissions from homes themselves, as covered by Building Regulations, so they will need to take action to ensure that the emissions associated with the energy use from heating, lighting, hot water and building services are reduced to zero.

Carbon savings will be made beyond the bricks and mortar, by building homes both with renewable energy technologies on site, such as solar power, and through off-site measures such as local community energy schemes. All new homes started after 2016 will be built to this standard, so housebuilders can now start working towards this date. The independent Zero Carbon Hub has established a series of work streams to address implementation.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1647083,Grant Shapps sets out vision to protect and preserve rural village life,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today set out his vision for protecting the future of rural village life for generations to come, by giving local communities the power to build the homes they need.

The Minister has outlined a new right that will allow communities across England to come together and create new homes, shops, businesses and facilities.

And today, these plans have the backing of celebrity builder and TV presenter Tommy Walsh.

The new Community Right to Build will shift power from Government to communities to allow local people to deliver the homes and development that they really want, without being told that their own expansion doesn't fit with their local council's plans and should not go ahead.

And Mr Shapps called on communities that have already come together to build homes, or have been thwarted by the red tape and bureaucracy of the current system, to come forward and consider using this new Community Right to Build.

Under the proposals, which will be contained in the Localism Bill, community organisations will have the freedom to give the green light to new local developments without a specific application for planning permission, as long as there is overwhelming community backing in a local referendum.

Any surplus made from the sale or renting of homes would be recycled for the benefit of the community.

But community organisations would not be restricted to just building family homes - they could choose to build sheltered housing for the elderly, or set aside plots for people to build their own homes.

They could even offer long-term low rent deals for local shops, community halls or sports facilities.

A new e-leaflet is published today, offering information and advice to communities interested in setting up Right to Build organisations.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Far from the Nimbyism that often hits the headlines, up and down the country there are entire communities willing and eager to give the go-ahead for new developments in their area. The countryside must be a vibrant place to live, and cannot be allowed to become a museum. I want to give communities the power to preserve their villages, which are currently struggling to survive because of a shortage of affordable homes.
> 
> ""With housebuilding at its lowest level in any peacetime year since 1924, some areas are facing a battle to keep schools and GP surgeries open as younger people are forced to move away. The new Community Right to Build could provide the answer. It will give residents the power to give the green light to new homes that are suitable and appropriate for their local area. And because local people are in charge, developments will only go ahead with their overwhelming support.
> 
> ""I want anyone with the vision and drive to build homes in their area to be able to do so. I want to hear about the challenges they've faced, and for them to look at our plans for the Community Right to Build, as it could offer them the freedom to achieve their ambition.""

Celebrity builder and TV presenter Tommy Walsh said:

> ""I've worked with people on community projects for many years, and in that time I've found that no one knows the needs of the community better than the people who live there.
> 
> ""Whether it's building affordable housing to allow young people to remain in their village, housing for the elderly, new schools or even business developments to keep the community vibrant - if it's what the community wants, it should be made easier for them to do it. Any moves to cut red tape and help local people will certainly be welcomed by me.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1868856,Grant Shapps signals an end to squatters rights,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today ""locked the door"" on squatters' rights for good, by strengthening the Government's advice to homeowners looking to protect their properties.

The Government will take steps in the New Year to make squatting a criminal offence - but the Minister argued that now was the time to redress the balance and make sure homeowners were fully aware of their rights.

Published jointly with the Ministry of Justice, today's strengthened guidance offers reassurance to homeowners that squatters are not above the law - and that there are steps they can take if a squatter invades their home.

Owners can get helpful tips online on how to protect their homes from burglars - many of which may also be useful in protecting their properties from squatters.

Owners are also advised to alert neighbours if their property is likely to be empty for a long time so they can report any suspicious activity.

The guidance also clarifies the 'legal warning' squatters often post on the front door. While this warning often states it would be a criminal offence to use or threaten violence to enter the property this is a distortion of the law as it stands - it does not apply to displaced residential occupiers trying to get back into their homes.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""There's never been such a thing as squatters' rights - they are just a misreading of the laws that are actually designed to protect the homeowner. I want to lock the door on squatters and their so-called rights once and for all.
> 
> ""I want homeowners to be fully aware of the laws that are already in place to protect them. That's why today I'm publishing updated and strengthened guidance, so people know the steps they can take to protect their properties from being invaded, and if squatters do move in, the legal steps that can be taken to have them removed.
> 
> ""And because we as a Government are all too aware of the misery and distress that squatters can cause, we will look to take steps in the New Year to make squatting a criminal offence.""

Justice minister Crispin Blunt said:

> ""We understand how distressing it must be for people to discover their home has been taken over by squatters.
> 
> ""We are conducting a review of the law to reinforce the position of law-abiding victims of squatting in both commercial and private property and expect to publish our further proposals in due course.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1626751,Grant Shapps signals start to housing 'revolution',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today confirmed that he will take forward legislation allowing the creation of Local Housing Trusts.

In a speech to the Community Land Trusts conference in London, the Minister confirmed that plans for Local Housing Trusts will be included in the forthcoming Decentralisation and Localism Bill, due to be introduced this Autumn.

Local Housing Trusts would have to show they have the support of the local community for planned housing developments, and would have to meet some basic planning criteria - but would not need to lodge specific planning applications.

Any profits made from new developments would have to be reinvested in the local community, and the land would remain with the housing trust - regardless of what happened to the houses built on top.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps, said:

> ""In opposition I said that if we won the election we would start a revolution - where communities would get involved in providing homes for themselves. Today it's time to start that revolution.
> 
> ""For the first time it will be communities, not central Government, who decide what happens in their local area.
> 
> ""We want local people to decide what happens in their community. Local Housing Trusts should be able to proceed in areas where there is overwhelming support for new developments from people living in the area.
> 
> ""But essentially I want communities to have the freedom to decide on the type and quantity of housing without external restrictions imposed by a centralised planning system. The English villages that captivate the world's imagination were largely built at a time before a planning system existed. They were built by local people to meet their needs.
> 
> ""I want to unlock the passions and drive of communities. I want to free them to realise their vision.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1918887,Grant Shapps tells councillors: don't let council officers be the backseat drivers,"Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today told councillors not to let back seat bureaucracy steer them off course on the road to greater town hall autonomy.

In a speech to the Local Government Association, Mr Shapps said the Government has set a new course towards independence for local authorities where elected councillors are in the driving seat.

Mr Shapps said it is now vital that locally elected representatives use these new powers - being introduced through the Localism Bill - and their democratic mandate to steer their council in the right direction.

Radical reforms are handing back control to councils and communities so they are in charge of the decisions about housing, planning and economic issues that affect their area.

The Government has abolished top down assessment regimes, which attempted to micromanage councils, and is introducing a new 'power of competence' that will give councillors the power to make decisions in the best interest of their local community.  
Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Local councillors are the heroes of their communities - they're hard working, dedicated and often unpaid. But for years these democratically elected representatives have been forced to sit on their hands in the passenger seat of local government, whilst local decisions are dictated to them from Whitehall.
> 
> ""The Government acted quickly to shift this balance of power, and has set councils on a revolutionary road where the authority and responsibility of councillors will be restored, along with their ability to respond to what local people need and want. We've put councillors in the driving seat.
> 
> ""It is councillors who have the democratic mandate to make decisions in the best interests of their communities. So I urge them to keep up the good work and seize this opportunity to set the right course for their local area, and break free from the red tape and bureaucratic control that has kept them in the slow lane for so long.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1735546,Grant Shapps to abolish century-old payment rules for parish councils,"Local Government Minister, Grant Shapps, has today unveiled plans to free England's 9,000 parish councils from archaic rules which prevent them from using modern banking methods and making fast and easy payments to the small businesses they employ.

Parish councils spend over £340million each year. But under laws introduced in 1894, even the smallest payments must be signed off by at two members of the council - creating a time-consuming process and leading them to use cheques instead of quick electronic transfers. In contrast, the Payments Council reports that cheque usage fell by £21.5billion in the last year alone.

So the Minister has confirmed that from 2011, parish councils will be given the freedom to use modern banking methods - in time for the abolition of cheques in eight years' time.  These changes are set to benefit the many private companies that parish councils employ, as they should now be paid faster.

The National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks will now work together to put important safeguards in place so all payments made by parish councils are legitimate and there is no misuse of the system.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Parish Councils have been around for over a hundred years, but it doesn't mean they should be bound by outdated rules which make it harder for them to serve their local community.
> 
> ""It's time to bring Parish Councils into the 21st Century so they can get on and do their jobs in a faster and simpler way.
> 
> ""This is about removing the barriers so that local people can deliver the services that their communities care about, but it could also help hard pressed contractors who rely on quick payments to survive.""

The move has also been supported by the National Association of Local Councils, whose Chairman Councillor Michael Chater said:

> ""I am delighted that the Government is making it easier for local councils to get on and do their job through modernising the rules on the way they can make payments.
> 
> ""This much needed reform is very welcome and underlines the important role local councils play in their communities supporting local people and local businesses.
> 
> ""This initiative will give a much welcome boost to local councils to help them operate more efficiently and effectively and enable them to continue to play their role at the heart of localism and Big Society.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1641007,Grant Shapps to overhaul rough sleeper counts,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced that the numbers of rough sleepers have hit an 11-year low - but that he is reviewing the way counts are conducted.

In total, 70 councils conducted street counts and reported that there were 440 rough sleepers in England on any given night.

In comparison, in 2009 76 councils conducted street counts and recorded 464 rough sleepers.

But the Minister has said he is sceptical of the methodology behind the street counts - only councils considered to have a problem with rough sleeping have been required to conduct a count.

So he will shortly consult on plans for a complete overhaul on the means of counting rough sleepers to give councils and charities a credible measure that truly reflects the situation on the streets and that gives a complete picture of the extent of rough sleeping.

A long-term campaigner for the homeless, Mr Shapps has confirmed that he will do all he can to safeguard homelessness funding in the face of tough economic times.

Despite in-year savings across Whitehall of £6.2bn and an emergency Budget outlining further measures to cut the record Budget deficit, Government funding for tackling homelessness has remained unchanged.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today's figures show that rough sleeping is at an eleven-year low - but I am sceptical that these figures reflect the situation on the streets.
> 
> ""Only councils considered to have a rough sleeping problem have been required to conduct counts - so in some of our biggest cities, while local people would be acutely aware of the problem of rough sleeping, official street counts were not conducted.
> 
> ""That's why I will shortly publish plans for a complete overhaul of the way the problem of rough sleeping is assessed so councils and charities can be given a credible measure of the problem in their area.""

A comprehensive range of Government efforts to tackle homelessness is underway.

The Prime Minister has agreed a cross-departmental approach so ministers from eight different Government departments are working together to see how the policies for which they have responsibility can help address the complex problems that cause people to lose their home.

As part of this cross-Government approach, Mr Shapps is also today publishing good practice guidance for doctors, health workers, probation staff and other frontline workers in helping homeless people. This will help them to more effectively help rough sleepers with emotional and psychological issues such as personality disorder or complex trauma.

This is an area that has previously been neglected: the evidence shows that up to 60 per cent of hostel residents have a diagnosable personality disorder compared to 10 per cent in the general population. However, rough sleepers are among the least likely to be able to access psychological services.

There is a strong link to entrenched rough sleeping and exclusion, as well as offending behaviour - today's guidance demonstrates how this can be tackled with effective local schemes.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1737469,Grant Shapps urges house price stability to help wannabe homeowners,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today made the case for a period of house price stability to prevent generations of potential homebuyers being priced out of the market.

In a speech to the Housing Market Intelligence conference in London, Mr Shapps argued that buying a property should not be seen only as an investment, but as a home to live in.

He said:

> ""With a house now liable to cost perhaps seven times someone's earnings, it is no surprise that the average unsupported first time buyer is 37 years old.  This country is in danger of letting down the aspirations of a generation of homes do not become more affordable in the long term.
> 
> ""So what is required now is a period of house price stability. A home should first and foremost be thought of as a place to live and bring up a family.""

The Minister also pledged Coalition Government support for housebuilders, by cutting through the 'alphabet soup' of standards and red tape that blight efforts to get developments started.  He called on industry leaders to work with Government in a new drive to simplify the system.

This work will complement the ongoing review of building regulations launched by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell earlier this year, and is in addition to the groundbreaking new 'One In, One Out' system where ministers seeking to introduce new regulations that will impose costs on business have to first identify current regulations of equivalent value that can be removed.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Last year, housebuilding hit its lowest level for any peacetime years since 1924 as developers have been hampered by regional targets that put them in direct conflict with local communities and an alphabet soup of regulations and red tape they have to navigate.
> 
> ""Today I have a clear message to housebuilders large and small - we are on your side. I am determined to make it easier to build the homes this country needs.  Appropriate building standards, applied sensibly, help developers and communities alike, but they can only be effective if they are easier to understand. That's why I want to simplify the process for housebuilders to meet the standards communities demand.
> 
> ""But I also want to make it easier for these companies to complete new developments where they are wanted. That's why we will introduce powerful new incentives so those communities that give the green light to developments see the benefits of the new homes in their area.""

They are: the Department for Education, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Communities and Local Government and the Home Office.

£390million will be made available to build 4,500 social rented homes, over 3,000 homes for sale at affordable prices and 1,000 stalled by the recession - protecting over 8,000 construction jobs.

> ""That's why I'm delighted that the Local Government Association and Home Builders Federation have agreed to appoint Sir John Harman to chair a valuable steering group on this issue and in its examination of how to clear the minefield of housing standards that currently exists. I have no doubt that he will provide the robust independent role to oversee this important work.
> 
> ""I look forward to seeing the recommendations of this new group, and working with them as we continue to make radical reforms to the planning system so communities can have more of a say and see the benefits of growth in their neighbourhoods.""

Stewart Baseley, executive chairman at the Home Builders Federation said:

> ""This is an important first step as we look to reduce the red tape and regulation levied on house building sites. At a time of significant housing shortages it is crucial that the cumulative impact of regulations and standards is scrutinised properly, to help ensure more housing is viable, and unnecessary burdens are avoided. The Steering Group will help Government, Local Authorities and the industry work together to create a realistic understanding that will allow us to build the quality homes the country needs.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1731205,Grant Shapps welcomes new repossession rules to protect tenants,"New rules come into force from today which will prevent tenants from having little or no notice to find a new place to live.

Previously, where a landlord had not been given a consent to let their property by their lender and later faced repossession, the courts were left unable to take account of the circumstances of their tenants, who were left in the distressing situation of being given very short notice to move.

However, today's new rules mean tenants will for the first time be able to attend the repossession court hearing, with judges able to take their situation into account and delay repossessions proceedings by up to two months.

New guidance published today makes clear the rights of tenants in this situation, and sets out the steps that lenders must take.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Of course all landlords should get permission from their lender before renting out their home. But when landlords don't, and they face the real prospect of repossession, their tenants should not be left worse off than any other tenant as a result.
> 
> ""That's why I backed the Mortgage Repossessions Bill last year, so tenants can have their voices heard in court and can get enough time to find a new place to live.
> 
> ""As with all homeowners I expect lenders to seek repossession only as a last resort. But where action is being taken against a landlord, their tenants must get a fair amount of time to find themselves a new home.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2089681,Grant Shapps welcomes overwhelming demand to Get Britain Building,"A Government scheme to get builders back on stalled sites and work restarted on homes has had an overwhelming response and is three times oversubscribed, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today revealed.

The £420million Get Britain Building fund is a key tenet of the Housing Strategy. Launched just two months ago, the Get Britain Building fund has seen a total of 176 expressions of interest - meaning the programme is now three times oversubscribed.

Mr Shapps argued that the short, simple and straightforward application process has made it easier for smaller building companies, as well as larger developers, to bid for funding.

Taken together, the bids received so far cover 392 individual sites. But overall, this £420million investment is expected to unlock the building of up to 16,000 homes on sites that are currently stalled - creating up to 30,000 jobs in construction and related industries by 2014.

Mr Shapps also published details of 18 of the most important local housing sites that subject to due diligence and contracting could benefit from Government cash to get builders back to work.

The Minister confirmed that these 18 developments will go to the next stage of assessment for £45million funding from this scheme to get workers back on site and deliver 1,300 new homes.

These include:

  * **Cheeseman's Green, Ashford** - includes plans for 140 new homes
  * **Bootham Green, York** - includes plans for 37 homes
  * **Newark Southern Extension** - includes plans for 100 homes

Grant Shapps said:

> ""With the Prime Minister putting housing centre stage in the road to economic recovery we are pulling out all the stops to get the jobs created and the red tape cut to ensure we get the homes this country needs built.
> 
> ""So I am greatly encouraged by the clamour from developers large and small to get Britain building by applying for a share of our £420million fund to unlock stalled sites across the country.
> 
> ""And today, I can confirm that 18 of the most difficult sites have already been identified to potentially share £45million to resolve the issues they face, get builders back on site and over 1,300 homes built. I look forward to seeing the results of the competition and the houses that result.""

Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, said:

> ""This excellent response to our programme puts us in a strong position to take forward those schemes which offer the very best value for money, make the biggest difference locally, and can re-start on site quickly. The link between housing and economic growth is well established, and in ensuring delivery of 16,000 new homes, investment through the Homes and Communities Agency will also help create new jobs and local economic activity.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/2086886,Grant Shapps writes to John Healey: urgent clarity on Council Tax referendums rules,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps writes to John Healey MP regarding the council tax referendums rules.

The Rt Hon John Healey MP  
House of Commons  
London  
SW1A 0AA

Dear John,

Thank you for your letter of 6 February to the Rt Hon Eric Pickles MP. Your letter has been passed to me to reply. The analysis you offered is familiar from briefing put round by SIGOMA: but it is technically flawed. My officials have, over the last week or so, been in touch with officers in various authorities in South Yorkshire, who have raised similar concerns.

The flaw in the argument is most easily exposed by reference to your illustration in which you say: ""An illustration shows the problem. If the basic amount of council tax of a local authority (which includes levies) is £100 million, and it decides to raise its council tax by what is understood as the maximum amount allowable without a referendum - 3.5 per cent - then an extra £3.5 million of funds would result."" This interprets the legislation, and the 3.5 per cent principle proposed by the Government, as if it has set a threshold in the overall amount of council tax that an authority may raise without triggering a referendum. It has not. The legislation requires the principle to be expressed in terms of the increase in Band D council tax which an authority would have set if, when calculating that amount, it left out of account the amount of levies issued to it in both the years being compared. This adjusted Band D amount is called the ""relevant basic amount of council tax"".

This figure is calculated by dividing council tax requirement (adjusted to exclude levies) by council tax base. Clearly, if a levy issued to an authority is substantially reduced, the actual council tax requirement would be expected to fall, and the actual basic amount of council tax (the normal band D amount) would also fall. The relevant basic amount of council tax would however be unaffected, since it excludes the cost of levies in both years.

If, instead of taking the burden of a levy off taxpayers when that levy is reduced, an authority chooses to increase its own expenditure to ""soak up the slack"", the relevant basic amount will rise, and may even breach the 3.5 per cent principle - even though the actual Band D change is below that figure. A referendum would then be required, and I am entirely happy that this outcome is justified.

The concept of ""relevant basic amount"" is only significant in the context of the determination by a local authority of whether it is setting a council tax which will trigger a referendum. For all other purposes, the natural definition of basic amount of council tax (i.e. the actual Band D amount) - which includes the cost of levies - continues to apply as it has for many years. You will, I am sure, appreciate that the legislation was framed in this way so that a referendum would not be triggered by the actions of a levying body over which the authority to which a levy is issued may have no control at all. The focus of that concern has usually been in terms of increases in such levies: but there is, I believe, no problem about the application of the legislation where a levy is reduced.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1974671,Grant Shapps writes to the Times about funding to help businesses affected by the riots,"Your reader ('Give us details on help for riot-hit firms', 21 August 2011) is right in making the point that difficulties accessing funds to repair riot-hit premises can be as damaging to businesses as the riots themselves. That's why the Government announced a package of funds to help those businesses affected, within days of the worst of the violence two weeks ago.

The one-off measures announced by my Department include a £10 million recovery fund to help councils make their areas safe, clear and clean; and a £20 million High Street Support Scheme to help businesses meet the short term costs of getting up and running again. These are in addition to the long-standing Riot (Damages) Act, which compensates for damage, destruction or theft to private premises.

The funds will be distributed by councils, who can spend the money now and be reimbursed by central government, meaning that the money gets quickly to where it's needed in local communities rather than being tied up in red tape. Indeed, we know that many councils have already given grants to small businesses to help them with upfront costs like insurance excesses, carrying out safety checks and legal advice.

Anyone needing further details should visit www.communities.gov.uk, where they can find details of all the help available and how to claim, or speak to their local council.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2100330,Apprenticeships in the home' for tenants,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today offered wannabe decorators and carpenters the opportunity to become ""an apprentice in the home"" - and get paid to hone their skills.

Under the Tenant Cashback Scheme, responsible residents will have the chance to tackle everyday DIY dilemmas like leaky taps, fitting doors and painting and decorating.

Those who sign up to the scheme could not only receive cash for their efforts - those who get a taste for DIY could also get on the career ladder with the opportunity of basic training programmes to help them develop their skills even further.

Mr Shapps said the Tenant Cashback scheme offers the opportunity:

  * **For tenants to earn extra cash** - up to £500 a year for those who sign up and agree to undertake minor repairs in their homes; and
  * **For communities to come together to take on repairs for their area**, pooling their money to improve the local area and help neighbours who can't do the work themselves

Today, the Minister met with councils and housing associations across the country, and urged them not to deny their tenants the opportunity for a fulfilling career - which could start in the comfort of their own homes.

Some landlords are already leading the way. These include:

  * **Home Group** - Social tenants in Coulby Newham, Durham, Braintree, Essex and Cumbria are being offered tailored DIY courses at a B&Q training centre to support them in carrying out their own repairs;
  * **Bromford Group** - Dudley, Lichfield, Cotswold, Stratford residents receive one to one advice on maintaining their homes and tenants have provided videos with hints and to help their neighbours get started; and
  * **Together Group** - Residents are all receiving basic DIY training, with wider support offered around developing a CV and employment opportunities.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Rather than having to wait for landlords to act, tenants should be able to tackle their own DIY dilemmas and get paid for it.
> 
> ""Tenant Cashback offers just that opportunity, with as much as £500 a year available to residents who sign up to tackle such minor repairs as leaky taps and decorating. And for some, this could even serve as an apprenticeship in the home and the start on a path to a whole new career.
> 
> ""This, combined with the potential to bring the local community together to improve the local area, means all councils and housing associations should give residents the right to take up tools through this new scheme.""

### Notes to editors

1. Social housing landlords are responsible for more than four million homes, and spend an average of £1,000 per property annually on repairs.

2. Tenant Cashback allows residents to take more control of their repairs budgets for their homes, for example, by carrying out their own DIY or commissioning it locally - allowing them to pocket any savings made which can then be used as they see fit, such as towards the deposit on their own house.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2143332,£1.8 million to tackle scandal of 'beds in sheds',"Minister pledges to 'flush out' criminal landlords

Criminal landlords trapping vulnerable people in 'suburban shanty-towns' will get the justice they deserve, Housing Minister Grant Shapps pledged today.

He allocated a £1.8 million fund to areas blighted by so-called 'beds in sheds', to tackle the problem head-on and end this growing practice by ruthless landlords.

Mr Shapps appealed to councils who may have turned a blind eye in the past to 'beds in sheds', to use this funding and the range of powers at their disposal, to tackle the issue.

'Beds in sheds' are often rented to migrants, including some with no right to be in the UK, at extortionate rates.

Their foreign 'tenants' often find it difficult to return home quickly after destroying their passports to avoid removal. With few other options, they will put up with cramped conditions, dodgy wiring and poor sanitation as an alternative to life on the streets.

Mr Shapps said that the £1.8 million fund would help the worst affected councils flush out those who exploit migrants at their most vulnerable. They are:

  * Brent
  * Ealing
  * Hillingdon
  * Hounslow
  * Newham
  * Peterborough
  * Redbridge
  * Slough, and
  * Southwark.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I'm determined to flush out criminal landlords who think they can make an easy buck from cramped, cockroach-ridden outhouses. The scandal of 'beds in sheds' must come to an end.
> 
> ""In the 21st century it simply isn't acceptable that people should be forced to live in such squalid and unsanitary conditions. That's why I've allocated £1.8 million to help councils in the worst affected areas crack down on this cruel exploitation.
> 
> ""But this is just the start. Our national taskforce, including the police, councils, the UK Border Agency and HM Revenue and Customs are pooling their resources to bring the so-called landlords of 'beds in sheds' to justice. I want anyone stuck in these suburban shanty towns to know that help is at hand and they will not be abandoned.""

### Notes to editors

1. The National Taskforce to tackle beds in sheds was announced on 30 April 2012 and can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2137365](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2137365).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2086214,£20 million for safety net against repossession,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced a new £20million safety net to help ensure that mortgage repossession remains the last resort for struggling homeowners.

This Preventing Repossessions Fund gives councils the opportunity to offer small interest free loans to struggling homeowners and ensure that court desks can offer on the day advice for those facing the prospect of repossession.

He urged anyone facing financial difficulty to use the range of free and independent advice available to get help and avoid losing their home.

Today's new funding includes £1million to ensure that free, on-the-day, legal advice is on hand in every county court for homeowners at risk of repossession. This much needed legal assistance is available at court to any individual facing homelessness and today's cash will 'plug the gaps' in the Housing Possession Court Duty Scheme ensuring that all courts are able to offer a viable service, where it is not already provided by the Legal Services Commission or independently.

In many cases applications for possession orders are rejected or suspended when a householder has access on the day legal advice - last year over 30,000 households benefited from the court duty desks.

Mr Shapps also gave a £19million cash injection to councils, so they can ensure that local people have access to real financial support to help allay the threat of losing their homes.

The Preventing Repossession Fund, which is being allocated to every local housing authority in England, enables them to offer struggling homeowners small interest-free loans of less than £5,000 or grants to help ease debt pressures and give them the breathing space to get back top of their finances.

Having the right advice and support on managing debts is crucial in helping homeowners to regain control of their debt. Alongside financial support those at risk of repossession should be given the knowledge and help to manage their finances in the future.

Local authorities are encouraged to work innovatively and flexibly with other local authorities, lenders and homeowners to ensure that the Preventing Repossession Fund is sustainable and tackles repossession in the best way for their area.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Repossession should only ever be the last resort. No one in financial difficulty should be embarrassed to seek help if they need it. Today's cash ensures that no matter where you are in the country the advice and the financial support is on hand to help people get on top of their finances and keep them in their hard earned homes.
> 
> ""Getting advice early is important but even for people facing a court hearing repossession is not a foregone conclusion. By extending the reach of the Court Desk scheme we are ensuring that no one is left stranded without the support of the free on the day legal advice that has already saved thousands of families from repossession.""

Today's announcement comes as the latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show the number of homes taken into possession in 2011 to be 36,200, lower than the 40,000 originally forecast and the lowest since 2007.

Tackling the deficit to help ensure that homeowners don't face rapid increases in interest rates is a top priority for Government and interest payments for mortgages are currently the lowest as a proportion of total income since records began.

The Government is also investing more than £200 million into the Mortgage Rescue Scheme. The scheme, available through local authorities, is designed to offer a last resort to the most vulnerable families to avoid repossession.

For homeowners struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and worried about the threat of losing their homes the Directgov website - [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgages](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgages) (external link) - has lots of free advice and information. Helpful advice is also on hand from organisations including Citizens Advice and the National Debtline.

### Notes to editors

1. £1million will be used to fund free legal advice for housing possession hearings within 54 courts that are not already funded by other sources. The funding will be distributed to 51 local authorities to commission a Court Desk scheme at their county court where one is not already provided independently or via the Legal Services Commission Each Authority will receive £18,500 per court desk in their area. The full allocation list is available at [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/2084358.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/2084358.xls) (Excel, 48KB).

2. Local Authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that information and advice to prevent homelessness is available. A Preventing Repossessions Fund (PRF) will provide an additional option for them to undertake activities they believe will assist in tackling repossessions in their area as part of their preventing homelessness strategy.

3. The Preventing Repossessions Fund has been allocated to all housing authorities. Allocations were based upon demand and reward.

4. Examples of how a Preventing Repossessions Fund could stabilise a households financial situation include interest free loans to pay off additional secured loans; loans to reduce arrears in exchange for lenders writing down debt to a more manageable level; facilitating access to the Mortgage Rescue scheme; or brokering a three way agreement between borrower (hardship payment), lender (writing off debt) and local authority (interest free loan). Loan payments would be conditional on the borrower acting on independent debt advice.

5. A key feature of such Funds are their recyclable nature which will enable an local authority to develop sustainable support over a longer period than one financial year. Local authorities can also pool their resources to develop economies of scale in delivery.

6. The Council of Mortgage Lenders published their repossession figures today, which can be found at: [www.cml.org.uk/cml/media/press/3142](http://www.cml.org.uk/cml/media/press/3142) (external link).

7. Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that mortgage possession claims are eight per cent lower than the fourth quarter in 2010, and claims leading to an order between October and December were seven per cent lower than in the same period last year. Of the first orders made in mortgage possession claims, 49 per cent were suspended. These figures can be found at: [www.justice.gov.uk/publications/statistics-and-data/civil-justice/mortgage-possession.htm](http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/statistics-and-data/civil-justice/mortgage-possession.htm) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1897535,£30 million lifeline for families trapped in abandoned streets,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced a £30 million lifeline to families trapped in abandoned streets due to stalled large scale housing demolition schemes.

The Housing Market Renewal programme, launched in 2002, created large scale targets for demolition clearance and new build homes. Over time many of these schemes did not secure the public or private investment necessary, which Ministers argue resulted in blighted areas where large scale demolition and clearance projects were stopped in their tracks, often leaving isolated residents living in just a few homes in otherwise derelict areas.

The Coalition Government is committed to helping the most vulnerable communities which is why Mr Shapps has announced a £30 million contribution towards locally-led schemes that will deliver long term financially sound solutions to these outstanding regeneration hotspots and at the same time help people trapped in the worst of these abandoned streets.

Ministers believe the most acute problems are in five Housing Market Renewal areas - Merseyside, East Lancashire, North Staffordshire, Hull and Teesside. There are areas where the lowest quartile house prices in the renewal areas have remained well below the regional average and where surrounding housing markets are weak.

Local authorities in these areas are being asked to develop proposals that will help abandoned families and allow the local leaders to get regeneration back on track. £30 million Government funding will be available to support initiatives but local authorities will also be expected to match fund projects by harnessing their own resources such as the New Homes Bonus. Bidding guidance will be issued to local authorities in due course and proposals will then be assessed to ensure they deliver value for money for the taxpayer before Ministers approve final payments.

While on a visit to the Liverpool Housing Market Renewal programme Grant Shapps said:

> ""Despite the best efforts of local communities, the previous centrally controlled programme of large scale housing demolition hasn't worked. It pitched neighbour against neighbour and in some cases trapped families in abandoned streets.
> 
> ""This Coalition Government is committed to helping vulnerable people and will not stand by when residents are stranded in derelict neighbourhoods through no fault of their own. That is why today I am announcing a £30 million lifeline for these isolated families whose lives have been blighted by failed schemes.
> 
> ""Regeneration only works when it has the support of local communities. So I look forward to receiving innovative and financially sound proposals, backed by local people, that will finally transform the lives of people in these communities.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Government is allocating up to £30 million to develop a transition scheme intended to help people trapped in the worst conditions where Housing Market Renewal schemes have been stalled, for example where only a few homes remain occupied in a derelict street. This is part of the Coalition Government's aim to help the most vulnerable communities.

2. This will be a match funding scheme generating around £60 million in total to resolve the worst problems across the five most challenged Housing Market Renewal areas - Merseyside, East Lancashire, North Staffordshire, Hull and Teesside.

3. DCLG and the Homes and Communities Agency will shortly be publishing bidding guidance which will invite local authorities in the five most challenged Housing Market Renewal areas to develop proposals. Local authorities will need to harness their own resources such as New Homes Bonus. On the basis of 50 per cent match funding from these other sources this would allow a £60 million fund which will tackle the worst of the problems in these five areas.

4. The scheme will be run by the Homes and Communities Agency and work through local authorities. It will be a clean break with the previous Government's Housing Market Renewal programme and will not fund completion of old schemes or the buying out of old contracts.

5. Funding for this scheme is a maximum. Future regeneration projects in these areas will need to look to other sources.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2041423,£430 million cash bonus for communities who have built homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced the latest instalment of powerful cash bonuses for communities who have built new homes.

The Minister announced that the second year of cash payments through the New Homes Bonus would total over £430 million, more than double the first year's payment.

Funding will be shared by 353 councils for helping to deliver nearly 159,000 homes last year - either new homes or empty properties brought back into use - and from a second round of payments for homes built the year before.

Through the New Homes Bonus extra funding is provided to local areas that have built more homes and brought empty homes back into use. Council tax raised from new homes is matched by the Government for the first six years, and affordable homes attract a higher payment.

This year's larger payment includes £210 million for new and empty homes delivered in 2010 -11, a second instalment of almost £200 million for homes built in 2009 -10, and the first premium for affordable homes totalling £20 million.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years communities fought against development because they saw no evidence of how it improved their lives. Their experience of housebuilding under the old system of top-down targets amounted to the wrong homes being built where they weren't wanted, and their concerns about extra pressure on local services ignored.
> 
> ""But there is a culture shift taking place across the country - communities that are going for growth are reaping rewards for their local area, and councillors can now lead a mature debate about the benefits of development.
> 
> ""The bonus payments for new homes last for six years - so this year's bonus is more than double the payment from year one, and it's why communities that continue to welcome new homes can expect to see bigger cash bonuses and improved local services in the future.""

Councils will work with their communities to decide how the extra funding is spent. Examples of where the New Homes Bonus is already making a difference include:

  * **Wychavon, Worcestershire** - the district council has consulted with local communities to ensure the bonus is spent where new homes are built. This means 40 per cent of the funding will be given to smaller parish councils, which they can use for village hall improvements, bus subsidies and to improve play areas and allotments. Funding will also be used to help local businesses and voluntary groups, and assist council services, including through supporting council tax.
  * **Plymouth** - the city council intends to ring-fence the bonus for use as part of Plymouth Growth Fund. This fund aims to regenerate the city centre and waterfront, increase the city's population by 50,000, create 42,000 new jobs, and deliver 30,000 new homes.
  * **Woking** - the borough council is asking local people about the amenities they would like to see the bonus spent on - these include improving community halls and recreational facilities for local people.

Under the scheme each new Band D home earns the council payments of nearly £9,000, and a new affordable home earns £2100 more than for a similar market home.

For example, last year Wandsworth Borough Council increased the number of new homes by 1,000 units, with about 200 affordable units, earning the council £10 million over six years to spend as they see fit - a significant funding at a time when public finances are tight.

These cash incentives are part of the Government's wider programme to give more powers to local people, so they can drive economic growth and create jobs.

The New Homes Bonus underpins many of the measures in the Government's radical new Housing Strategy, which will tackle issues across the housing market, from boosting supply and making it easier to secure mortgages on new homes, to ensuring homes that have been left empty for years are lived in once again.

### Notes to editors

1. The New Homes Bonus provides incentives for local authorities to deliver sustainable development. Details of provisional funding allocations for 2011-12 being announced today can be found using the New Homes Bonus Calculator, which can be found under 'Related downloads' at: [www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingsupply/newhomesbonus/)

2. Councils are already consulting with their local communities to decide how to spend the New Homes Bonus. For example, in Worcestershire Wychavon District Council has worked with local people to develop a protocol for spending the bonus, which ensures that the benefits of growth are returned to the communities where new homes are being built.

This includes:

  * regeneration and area partnerships - £200,000 to support the council's three area partnerships that promote regeneration and local economic activity
  * grants to the voluntary sector - £100,000 to support Wychavon's voluntary sector and put organisations on a more sustainable footing
  * planned growth around the city of Worcester - 40 per cent for pooled funding to support town infrastructure and other community facilities
  * development in towns and villages - 40 per cent to reinvest in community facilities to support projects in the towns and parishes - for example, village hall improvements, flood protection, bus subsidies, play areas, allotments and green initiatives
  * supporting affordable housing and investment in new housing - funding for schemes supporting affordable homes and bringing empty properties back into use, and
  * supporting the council tax - supporting services for local communities, reducing the pressure on council tax and reserves.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1809822,2011 will be the year councillors become community champions,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today said that 2011 will be the year of councillor power and encouraged a new generation of community champions to put their names on the ballot paper for May's local elections.

The Minister said that the Localism Bill will help place councillors centre stage in their communities with more clout than ever before to get things done for the people they serve.

This includes freeing councillors from restrictions that prevent them from championing local issues. And today, Mr Shapps has written to every council in England to outline how the new Localism Bill will clarify these rules which are known in jargon as predetermination.

Ministers believe it is wrong that councillors can feel they are prevented from performing the very role they were elected to do because they have declared a particular view on an issue.

But predetermination rules do just that. For example, someone standing for election against a proposed new development in the area would not be able to vote on the issue once elected if that development came before the council for planning permission - or in an extreme case councillors were warned that they could not comment on a new park and ride scheme as they were car owners.

This has led to widespread confusion and concern that championing a particular issue could lead to allegations of bias - and has led some council officers to advise their councillors against discussing matters of local importance. For example:

  * Members of South Cambridgeshire District Council were warned that they may be disqualified from discussing a proposed new site for a mobile phone mast if they themselves used a mobile phone, and could not comment on a proposed new park and ride scheme if they owned a car.
  * Candidates standing for election to Reigate and Banstead Council were warned against discussing a controversial decision to close a local swimming pool and sell the land for housing, because to express a view would exclude them from voting on the issue if elected.
  * An independent councillor on Rushmoor Borough Council was prevented from voting at full council on a proposal to turn the Farnborough Aerodrome into an executive jet centre, because he had expressed his opposition to the plans during his election campaign.
  * Councillors on North Shropshire District Council were discouraged from expressing their views on plans to introduce parking charges in three local market towns until a final decision was taken, for fear that to comment before the vote could leave the council open to legal challenge. This was despite the plans to introduce parking charges provoking lively debate among local residents.

So in a letter to councillors across England, Mr Shapps today highlighted how measures in the new Localism Bill will reform the rules that have barred them from taking part in decisions where they had campaigned or expressed a predisposed view.

The Localism Bill will change the law to allow councillors to campaign on local issues and champion the needs of their residents - ending widespread and long-standing uncertainty among councillors, leaving them free to better represent their communities.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It is ridiculous that a community can vote for someone standing on a particular issue, only for that person to be barred from talking about it once in office. Councillors must be given the freedom to properly represent the views of their constituents.
> 
> ""The Localism Bill will do just that. It will clarify the predetermination rules and so put an end to uncertainty that has left councillors up and down the country confused and concerned about whether voicing an opinion on an issue of local importance will lead to charges of bias.
> 
> ""We are placing councillors centre stage in their communities with more clout than ever before to get things done for the people they serve. 2011 will truly be the year of councillor power. That's why I want to encourage a new generation of community champions to put their names on the ballot paper for May's local elections.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1775594,A fairer future for social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today announced plans for the most radical reform of social housing in a generation, with a fundamental shift of power from Whitehall to councils and local housing associations.

The changes will affect all areas of social housing policy, giving councils more flexibility to use their social housing stock to the maximum effect and drive down waiting lists. Over the past 13 years the number of people on waiting lists has almost doubled to five million - caused, Ministers argue, by the current centrally-determined rules.

Ministers believe that the current rules to allocate social homes are unfair and, despite £17billion of spending on social housing over the last 13 years, have left nearly twice as many people on waiting lists.

Proposals published today will make the system fairer, giving councils the option to offer flexible tenancies and greater local discretion to decide allocations, so better use is made of this valuable national resource. The rules will strike a sensible balance between the needs of new and existing tenants, and ensure the support that social housing provides is focussed on the most vulnerable and those who need it most, for as long as they need it.  
Mr Shapps said councils will be given much greater flexibility to help homeless families find appropriate housing, and existing tenants who may be trapped in unsuitable accommodation, or unable to take up a job offer because they can't move. A quarter of a million social homes remain overcrowded, and more than 400,000 under-occupied.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long in this country there has been a lazy consensus about the use of social housing, which has left one of our most valuable resources trapped in a system that helps far fewer people than it should. This out-of-date approach has seen waiting lists rocket and is unfair to people who genuinely need social homes. They trap existing tenants in poverty, often in homes that aren't suitable for them.
> 
> ""So the current system is ripe for reform, and the changes we're bringing in will ensure that from now on our social housing helps as many people as possible. The new system will protect the most vulnerable in society, ensuring those in greatest housing need are given priority. It will also be more flexible, with councils and housing associations able to offer fixed tenancies that give people the helping hand they need, when they need it. But above all it will be fairer - councils will now be able to make decisions that genuinely meet the needs of local people, and the changes will not any affect any existing tenants.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""To have five million people stuck on social housing waiting lists is unacceptable - clearly this system is broken and needs a radical overhaul.
> 
> ""We need to have a much smarter system that protects lifetime tenancies, but also provides the flexibility to ensure that help is targeted at people who really need it, and enables us to get more for every pound of taxpayers' money. In times of economic hardship, it is vital that social housing is effective in helping people get back on their feet.""

Key reforms will include:

  * **Flexible tenancies** - decisions on tenancy arrangements will be made locally. Currently national policy dictates that social landlords can only offer lifetime tenancies. Social homes for life are allocated to people who may have only a short-term housing crisis, which means households continue to occupy a social home and to pay low rents, even if they no longer need this support. Councils and housing associations will now have the flexibility to offer new social housing tenants fixed tenancies - offering minimum contracts of two years. The lifetime tenancies and succession rights of existing council and housing association tenants will not be affected. New tenants will be guaranteed one succession to a spouse or partner, with landlords free to grant further succession rights.
  * **Fairer allocations** - councils will now be able to set their own rules about who qualifies to go on the housing waiting list. At the moment anyone can apply to live in social housing, whether they need to or not. The 'reasonable preference' categories for those with the greatest housing needs will be kept, to ensure priority for social housing continues to go to the most vulnerable in society and those who need it most.
  * **Greater mobility** - it will be easier for any of the eight million social tenants in England to move when their circumstances change. Only five per cent of social tenants moved home over the past year compared to almost a quarter of tenants in the private sector. Existing tenants will be removed from housing waiting lists - freeing up social landlords to work together and focus on helping those tenants wanting to move to do so. A new National Home Swap Scheme will offer tenants access to details of social homes available for swaps across the country, regardless of which home swap service they have joined - making it easier for them to move whether to a different sized property, to be closer to family, or for work.
  * **Fairer provision for homeless people** - there will be greater flexibility for councils to make decisions on how best to help people at risk of homelessness at the local level. Currently some homeless families are turning down the decent private rented accommodation they've been offered as a settled home, and demanding to be provided with expensive temporary accommodation, at huge cost to the taxpayer, until a social home becomes available. Councils will be able to offer flexible solutions to people at risk of homelessness. Despite tight public finances, the Government will be investing £400m to prevent homelessness and rough sleeping.
  * **Affordable Rents** - a new 'Affordable Rent' tenancy will be offered by housing associations to some new tenants of social housing from April 2011. Affordable Rent properties will offer fixed term tenancies at a rent higher than social rent - with landlords able to set rents at up to 80 per cent of local market rents. This will enable landlords to raise funds to build more affordable housing for those who need it. The Government is investing £4.5 billion in new affordable homes over the Spending Review period, which combined with the reform of social housing should deliver up to 150,000 new homes over the next four years.
  * **New tenants power of scrutiny** - Grant Shapps has announced plans for the abolition of the Tenant Services Authority, and instead to give England's eight million social housing tenants strengthened powers to ensure that their landlords provide quality housing and are held to account when problems arise. Landlords will be expected to support tenant panels - or equivalent bodies - in order to give tenants the opportunity to scrutinise the services being offered and to be involved in resolving disputes. These changes will be made as part of the forthcoming Localism Bill.

### Notes to editors

1. The Government has embarked on a radical programme to shift power from Westminster to councils and communities, including a fundamental reform of social housing. Details of the proposals, some of which will be subject to consultation, are published in _Local decisions: a fairer future for social housing_. A copy of the paper can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingreform](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingreform).

2. The Government will be making further announcements on getting empty homes back into productive use in due course. Other reforms included in the paper include changes to:

  * **Succession** - the rules on succession will become the same for all new council and housing association tenants. There will be an automatic legal right of one succession to a spouse or partner. However, landlords will be able to give additional succession rights in the tenancy agreement, if they choose. The changes to succession will not affect existing tenants or the right of a joint tenant to take over the tenancy when the other joint tenant dies.
  * **Council Housing Finance** - the current arrangement for financing council housing - through the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system - is complex, leaves authorities uncertain about future income and doesn't enable them to plan long-term. The Government plans to replace this with a new self-financing arrangement that will enable councils to keep all the rent money they raise and spend it locally on their services. It will also enable tenants and local taxpayers to hold their landlord to account for the cost and quality of their housing.

3. The Department has today written to local councils and fire authorities outlining its support for specific PFI projects. This follows a review of the Department's priorities for investment after last month's Spending Review. This has concluded that all the housing, fire and joint service centre PFI projects under contract and in procurement (subject to rigorous assessment of value for money) will continue to be funded but not those in the initial design stage.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2082140,Bid to become a Portas Pilot,"Struggling towns and cities across England are being handed the chance to breathe new life into their ailing high streets, Grant Shapps has announced today.

![Illustration of a high street](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2082239.jpg)Illustration by Dermott Flynn

Mary Portas and the Local Government Minister launched a competition to choose 12 towns to become 'Portas Pilots', with the winners benefiting from a share of £1 million to help turn around their ""unloved and unused"" high streets.

Mr Shapps has offered the cash incentive to those towns that come up with the best High Street blueprints in a move that fulfils the first and last recommendations of Mary Portas' High Streets Review, commissioned by the Prime Minister and published before Christmas.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Our high streets have faced stiff competition from Internet shopping, and out-of-town shopping centres - leaving them underused, unloved and under-valued. The Internet is not going to go away, and so for our high streets to survive they need to offer something new and exciting.
> 
> ""So today I'm offering a golden ticket to 12 town centres across the country to become 'Portas Pilots' - areas with the vision and enthusiasm to breathe new life into what should be the beating heart of their communities, and they will get Mary's and my support as they try out the ideas in her recent review.""

Mary Portas said:

> ""I am thrilled that now there is an opportunity to turn my recommendations into reality by giving communities across the country the opportunity to come forward with their vision for breathing new life into their locality. I hope my Review has inspired people with another vision of tomorrow where our high streets are re-imagined as destinations for socializing, culture, well being, learning as well as shopping. I want the first twelve Town Teams to challenge the old ways of working, experiment, take risks and reaffirm their place at the heart of a community. A place we all want to be and can be proud of.""

Taking forward the first recommendation from Mary Portas's review, the 12 successful localities will create Town Teams, made up of the key players in their local community - such as the council, local landlords, shopkeepers and the local MP.

These teams will then benefit from the backing of the Minister, Whitehall and Mary Portas herself as they take forward the recommendations from the review and in their area. They will also receive a share of £1 million.

Grant Shapps added:

> ""I want to see how these Town Teams plan to try new things, experiment and ensure that their high streets and parades become destinations for local people want to be. But these pilots are just the start. We want to learn their lessons and help communities across the country breathe new life into their own towns. Launching this competition now is a signal of our understanding that there's no time to waste in driving forward these important measures.""

Mr Shapps will give the full Government response to the review by the Spring.

Successful bidders will need to demonstrate how they have the energy, enthusiasm and vision to make a real difference to their town centres and make them the hubs of their communities.

Areas will need to demonstrate how they plan to breathe new life into their high streets and shopping parades, but not just in a staid application form - Mr Shapps would also like to see their pitches to become Portas Pilots in short YouTube clips.

### Notes to editors

1. We are looking for pilots areas with a transformational vision for their high street and the backing to make it a reality. The lead partner should be able to clearly articulate this vision and demonstrate strong support for it from the local community and a wide range of local partners. The bids will need to show:

  * A **mix** of pilot areas: from a variety of town centres and high streets including market towns, villages, large towns, new towns, coastal towns and suburban areas. We also want to ensure a good geographical spread, as well as areas with both high/low average income levels  and high/low empty shop vacancy rates.

  * **Commitment**: we are looking for bids to demonstrate maximum commitment to the town team approach.

  * **Potential for improvement**: resources will be allocated on a value for money basis and therefore areas must be able to demonstrate their potential for improvement; and

  * **Innovation**: bidders are asked to provide an outline of what the key priorities for their pilot area will be. We are looking for the most innovative ideas **and evidence of strong leadership** that will have maximum impact and can be replicated elsewhere.

2. _The Portas Review: An independent review into the future of our High Streets_ was published on 13 December 2011: [www.communities.gov.uk/portasreview](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/portasreview). The Review made ambitious recommendations on what can be done - by Government, local authorities and business - to help high streets deliver something new. The focus is on putting the heart back into the centre of our high streets, re-imagined as exciting social hubs for shopping learning, socialising and having fun.

3. The recommendations of the Portas Review aim to:

  * **Get town centres running like businesses**: by strengthening the management of high streets through new 'Town Teams', developing the Business Improvement District model and encouraging new markets
  * **Get the basics right to allow businesses to flourish**: by looking at how the business rate system could better support small businesses and independent retailers, encouraging affordable town centre car parking and looking at further opportunities to remove red tape on the high street
  * **Level the playing field**: by ensuring a strong town centre first approach in planning and encouraging large retailers to show their support for high streets
  * **Define landlords' roles and responsibilities**: by looking at disincentives for landlords leaving properties vacant and empowering local authorities to step in when landlords are negligent; and
  * **Give communities a greater say**: by greater inclusion of the high street in neighbourhood planning and councils using their new discretionary powers to give business rate concessions to new local businesses.

4. The prospectus and application form are available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/portaspilotsprospectus/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/portaspilotsprospectus).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1872394,Budget is a boost for first time buyers,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has hailed a new scheme that will help 10,000 aspiring first time buyers get foot on the property ladder.

It was announced in The Budget that the Government is to make £250 million available for a new FirstBuy scheme to help first time buyers who are struggling to purchase a new home, due to requirements for a large deposit.

Over the next two years FirstBuy will help 10,000 prospective first time buyers purchase new build homes, providing a shot in the arm for the construction industry.

Housebuilders will match the Government's contribution to the scheme, which will provide a 20 per cent equity loan to top up first time buyers own deposit of 5 per cent, enabling buyers to take out a mortgage for 75 per cent of the property.

First time buyers are vital for the housing market and for the sales of new build homes and Mr Shapps said that giving them a foot up onto the housing ladder goes to the heart of the Government's commitment to support aspiration.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Demand for new homes is still growing, but last year housebuilding slumped to its lowest peacetime level since 1924.
> 
> ""First time buyers are still facing huge difficulties - many young people are being forced to postpone homeownership until their thirties and creditworthy first time buyers on good incomes are missing out on the opportunity to enter housing market by the lack of a large cash deposit.
> 
> ""By making up to £250 million available over the next two years for deposits on new build homes, this Budget shows that we are serious about sorting this out, and supporting our construction industry to build more homes, create new jobs and increase the pace of economic growth.""

Loans will be free of charge for the first five years and repaid on resale of the property, with the funds recycled to fund more homes for the scheme. The first homes are expected to come on stream in September 2011.

Industry bodies welcomed the announcement as a much needed boost for the housing market.

Sarah Webb, Chartered Institute of Housing Chief Executive, said:

> ""Our housing market is still in intensive care but this measure to give first time buyers access to a sizeable deposit as an interest free loan is a welcome adrenaline boost. We are currently building fewer than half of the homes we need and anything the government can do to support new house building and support construction sector jobs is welcome.""

Stewart Baseley, Housebuilders Federation, said:

> ""We are pleased the government is listening to industry concerns and has recognised the economic and social benefits of building more homes. With Firstbuy the Government has stepped up with a policy that will help first time buyers, boost economic growth and provide a vital shot in the arm for the housebuilding industry.""

David Orr, National Housing Federation, said:

> ""First-time buyers have effectively been locked out of the housing market since the credit crunch by the mortgage drought. Only those lucky few who have been able to put down huge deposits up front have had any chance of getting a foot on the property ladder up until now. This scheme will offer first-time buyers on moderate incomes a much needed helping hand towards buying an affordable home and is a very welcome move.""

Pete Redfern, Taylor Wimpey, said:

> ""We are pleased to see George Osborne's announcement on FirstBuy in the budget. Whilst we control our use of shared equity schemes carefully, we do believe that they have a place given the current challenges in the mortgage market. This new government scheme will allow us to maximise our support to first time buyers whilst focusing more of our capital on investment in new sites.""

Other radical announcements in the budget designed to get the country building again include:

  * powerful new incentives through the New Homes Bonus to give communities a share in the rewards of growth, and a reason to say yes to new development

  * removing the unfavourable Stamp Duty treatment of bulk purchases of new build homes

  * radical plans to accelerate the release of public sector land for development - making use of innovative 'build now, pay later' techniques, where house builders don't pay for the land until they complete the houses

  * introduction of a Community Infrastructure Levy, which local councils can raise to fund local facilities that support housing growth

  * reforming the planning system through a range of measures, including the introduction of a powerful new presumption in favour of sustainable development, removing centrally imposed, top down targets, and consult on plans to simplify the planning process.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1810518,Build your new year's resolution with bricks and mortar,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on the country's aspiring self-builders to make a housebuilding revolution their New Year's resolution.

Self-builders are already Britain's largest housebuilder, and account for one-fifth of Britain's new homes each year, but for far too long the aspirations of ordinary people to build their own home have been thwarted by barriers and red tape.

These obstacles have led to the UK having one of the lowest proportions of new homes built by self-builders in Europe - so Mr Shapps has pledged to end self-building as the preserve of the privileged few, and enable aspiring self-builders to put building their own home at the top of their New Year's resolutions.

Barriers that stand in people's way will be torn down - including a complex and bureaucratic planning system, regulatory burdens, and lack of access to land and finance.

A new Community Right to Build will offer communities the chance to give the green light to new developments without the need for specific planning applications.

This could be local people working alone to build their own homes, or entire communities coming together to build the homes the area needs.

The new right offers people a solution to their housing needs in villages, towns and cities up and down the country. If communities support locally-led proposals they can help to regenerate abandoned urban sites or build homes in countryside communities, ensuring they remain vibrant places to live and not museums.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Building your own home should not be the preserve of a privileged few - I want to break down the barriers that many aspiring self-builders often come up against.  That's why I've asked experts at the National Self Build Association to work with us to develop an action plan to make it easier for people to build their own homes, whether on their own or as part of a community effort to build a whole new neighbourhood.
> 
> ""But the action plan will also look at how more people can be helped to make the most of the opportunities to build their own homes. For example, the new Community Right to Build will put power in the hands of local people to give the go-ahead to new developments in their area - and could open the door to a whole new generation of self-builders.
> 
> ""This will give a real boost to those who have long dreamed of building their own home, but have never been able to do so. I want these people to build their New Year's resolution with bricks and mortar, and make 2011 the year they make their housebuilding dreams a reality.""

The self-build sector is already important to growth and housing supply - with self-builders completing as many as 10,000 building projects each year - so making it easier for more people to build their own home will provide a welcome boost to the housing market.

Mr Shapps has today asked the National Self Build Association (NASBA) to work with his officials to develop an action plan to boost the number of self-builders across the country - and address the common barriers aspiring self-builders face, including:

  * availability of land - including making public sector land available for house building
  * availability of finance - working with lenders to ensure self-building communities can get the finance they need
  * availability of expert support - how self-builders can support communities looking to build the homes they need, and how those new to self-building can be supported.

Ted Stevens, Chairman of the National Self Build Association, said:

> ""We believe there are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK that are keen to build their own, very affordable homes, so anything the Government can do to help make this happen has to be applauded. By encouraging more self build people will get the homes they really want, very cost effectively. For example, it's perfectly possible to build a three bedroom home for around £150,000.
> 
> ""A boost to the self build sector will also create job opportunities in the construction industry and the wider construction materials sector. And most self builders are very committed to environmental and community issues too, so more self build should lead to greener homes and more cohesive communities.""

Designer Wayne Hemingway said:

> ""It's the right time for the Government to start promoting self build. That's for sure. We've a got a society that enjoys design and enjoys creativity, loves watching Grand Designs, and new house building doesn't have to be as posh as Grand Designs - we have clearly got an appetite for doing our own homes.
> 
> ""Because of the money that you save on self build you've got more chance to include green initiatives. And by the very nature of being a self builder you are more likely to look at things like that because you want to save money all the way.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1708995,Building more homes,"Summary: Letter from housing minister Grant Shapps in response to an article in the Guardian (25 August 2010) about the future of house building.

Peter Hetherington (Opinion, 25 August) fails to see the bigger picture about what we're doing to get this country building again.

His article seems to suggest that by freeing councils from top-down regional targets we've brought house-building immediately to a standstill. In fact, it was under the previous government that the number of new homes being started slumped to the lowest levels since 1924. A resounding endorsement of the bloated Regional Spatial Strategies? I think not. The reality is that dictating how many homes each council builds and by when is not only ineffective, but it can divide and cause resentment among communities.

We believe that local people should get the chance to decide about the future of their towns and villages and drive forward the building of new and affordable homes where they are needed. Reviving a house-building market that is on its knees takes much more than pieces of paper from central government telling town halls what and when to build. That's why we've pledged to give councils substantial extra funding if they build new homes through our New Homes Bonus. This will mean that they get significant financial benefits from building the homes their communities really need.

And, at the same time, we're giving struggling rural villages the chance to secure their long-term future and build new homes that locals can actually afford to live in through the Community Right to Build scheme.

Everyone knows we need to build more homes, but top-down targets and regional bureaucracy haven't worked - we need more carrots not sticks.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1861960,Byker success story 'the embodiment of the Big Society',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today put power firmly in residents' hands by giving the green light for the iconic Byker Estate in Newcastle to be put into community control.

Visiting the Grade II listed estate, Mr Shapps applauded the efforts of tenants who ""never took no for an answer"" and campaigned for control of their neighbourhood, describing them as ""the embodiment of the Big Society"", paying tribute to Newcastle City Council and the Homes and Communities Agency who supported their efforts.

And he welcomed efforts to ensure that, as residents work to secure Byker's future for generations to come, they benefit from the Government's Green Deal to make their homes greener and cheaper to run.

The Byker Estate was designed by Ralph Erskine, and won international acclaim as a prime example of 1970s social housing development. Byker gained Grade II listed status in 2006, but investment is now needed to bring the estate up to modern standards.

Under the plans, a Community Trust will be established to manage this investment, creating training and employment opportunities for local people. Residents would play a key role in the trust, and would work alongside Your Homes Newcastle, which would provide support and management services.

The Government will support this by writing off a local housing debt associated with the estate of up to £42m.

Mr Shapps also welcomed efforts for Byker residents to benefit from cheaper energy bills through the new Green Deal, and other green initiatives.

Plans under consideration include a new heating system so that, rather than controlling the heating centrally, tenants will be able to control their own heating in their properties and benefit from cheaper energy bills. This particular scheme is expected to cost £16m - with £11m coming from private investment.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Byker residents are rightly proud of their iconic estate, but have recognised the need for investment to secure it for generations to come. For years, they have refused to take no for an answer and have campaigned to take control of their own neighbourhood.
> 
> ""These residents are the embodiment of the Big Society in action and today, I can confirm that I am giving the green light for Byker to be put under community control, giving the power to tenants who have wanted for years to be able to determine their own future.
> 
> ""Newcastle City Council and the Homes and Communities Agency have also been instrumental in making this happen, and I would like to pay tribute to the work that they have put in. But for me, the story of Byker doesn't end there. As the community looks to get the funding it needs to maintain their estate, they will also benefit from the Government's Green Deal - making their homes greener, and cheaper to run with lower energy bills.""

David Faulkner, Leader of Newcastle City Council, said:

> ""Everybody, including local residents, has worked incredibly hard to put together a package which offers investment, security, and a real voice for local people. The decision will be theirs, but we welcome the support of government.
> 
> ""This announcement recognises the national importance of the estate and is a result of much hard work on behalf by our partners the Homes and Communities Agency and the Byker Investment Task Group in delivering an innovative solution to the investment challenges of the estate.""

Professor Peter Roberts, Chair of the Byker Taskforce and a member of the Homes and Communities Agency's Board, said:

> ""Byker is an excellent example of how to put the community in the driving seat and deliver local solutions.
> 
> ""It brings together local people with the Council, the Homes and Communities Agency and central Government in a productive and positive partnership. It also builds on the deep-rooted tradition of community ownership of 'their' place: Byker people delivering a future for Byker.""

David Curtis, executive director at the Homes and Communities Agency, said:

> ""I'm delighted that the hard work of the Homes and Communities Agency, the Council and local people, which has led to a proposal representing good value for money for the whole community, has now been approved.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1701472,Bypass Whitehall and scrap outdated byelaws,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today outlined plans to give councils a new power to review and revoke outdated byelaws.

This means that old local rules, like those about dickey straps in Hammersmith, fish frying in Gloucester, and carpet beating in Blackpool will be a matter for these areas, rather than central government.

As part of wider Government plans to hand power back to councils and communities the planned reforms will mean that councils can create new byelaws or get rid of old ones without seeking permission from Whitehall.

Under the current regime, councils would have to first contact the Secretary of State for Local Government for a stamp of approval before they can abolish outdated laws.

Instead, under these new reforms councils would be required to consult with local residents based on an assessment of why a law should be created or cancelled - with no need to involve central Government at all.

Existing byelaws which councils might choose to scrap include:

  * Byelaws relating to the use of dickey straps (the leather straps which hold the driving box of horse drawn carriages in place) and skidpans (A shoe or clog, attached to a chain, and placed under the wheel of a wagon to prevent its turning when descending a steep hill) from 1913 (London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham Council)
  * An 1887 byelaw preventing the beating of carpets or the placing of any clothing or towels on the Promenade (Blackpool Borough Council)
  * A 1956 byelaw which prohibits the drying of clothes in various parks in Whitstable. (Canterbury City Council).
  * A 1905 byelaw relating to the transport of dead horse carcasses. (London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham Council)

And Gloucester City Council has told Ministers that they have unearthed 60 old bylaws they want to revoke and not replace, including:

  * A 1911 byelaw requiring domestic servants to register with the council;
  * A byelaw introduced in 1947 regarding the cleaning of ashpits and cesspools; and
  * A 1968 byelaw regulating fish frying and 'other offensive trades'

It's old byelaws like this that the new legislation will give councils the freedom to revoke without coming to Whitehall for the stamp of approval.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It should not take a rubber stamp from central Government to scrap outdated local laws. For far too long, councils have had to jump through hoops just to get things done for residents. That's why I want councils to use this new power I am offering them, and keep a watchful eye out for outdated rules that will soon be so much easier to scrap.
> 
> ""But people should also be free to contact their council with their concerns and have them addressed easily, so councils should also look to set local byelaws that improve their area - with no ministerial involvement whatsoever.
> 
> ""This is part of wider Government plans to devolve power straight from Whitehall to Town Halls and to communities, so they can improve the quality of their area for themselves.""

### Notes to Editors

1. Presently, byelaws have to be confirmed by the Secretary of State before they come into force. Ministers believe this process is not always necessary and are proposing that authorities be allowed to make and revoke byelaws without always being confirmed by the Secretary of State.

2. Subject to legislative timetable, councils will be able to use these new powers from early New Year.

3. To scrap byelaws, councils will have to consult their communities. Accountability will become a truly local matter, with local consultation on the proposed byelaw ensuring that those affected by any new byelaw have an opportunity to comment upon it.

4. The changes will apply to councils in England only.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2112954,Cash to wounded warriors: government commitment to support our troops beyond the battlefield,"Cash payments for councils who have adapted the homes of wounded soldiers injured in the line of duty were announced today by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

16 councils will receive a share of more than £200,000 funding for helping injured military personnel return to a home that meets their needs and adapt to their new life.

These councils serve areas that include armed forces bases, and together have helped 26 injured servicemen and women by making adaptations to their homes.

#### Housing help

Mr Shapps said the Government remains committed to support the housing needs of the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our country.

As well as funding vital adjustments to the homes of injured personnel, serving and recently retired members of the armed forces are being put at the front of the queue for social housing and for assistance to buy their first home through the Government's FirstBuy and HomeBuy schemes.

Last year, Grant Shapps wrote to all councils in England inviting them to strengthen their contacts with members of the armed forces community and encouraging them to sign up to a community covenant.

And in this week's Budget, the Chancellor announced an additional £100 million to improve military accommodation, and £3 million to double the council tax rebate for deployed military personnel - from 50 per cent to 100 per cent.

#### Funding for adaptations

The Minister announced the funding alongside the allocation of £180 million funding for next year for the Disabled Facilities Grant, which councils can use to pay for adaptations and facilities that enable people with disabilities to stay in their home.

Despite tough constraints on the public finances, Ministers have protected funding for the Disabled Facilities Grant programme. Councils in England can use the funding to provide better access to peoples' homes, and to pay for modifications, such as wider doorways and stairlifts, which help disabled people maintain their independence.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""This Government's commitment to support our troops is not just about equipping them for life on the battlefield - it's about ensuring they are supported to live full, independent lives with dignity after service.
> 
> ""The extra funding for councils is making a life-changing difference to the brave men and women who have been injured in the line of duty. Instead of facing long stays in hospital or going into residential care, they can now live with their loved ones in the comfort of their own home.
> 
> ""We are committed to honour the sacrifices made by our military men and women, which is why we have also taken steps to ensure members of the armed forces are at the top of priority lists for all Government-funded home ownership schemes, and to end the unfair treatment of military personnel applying for social housing.""

Funding for the Disabled Facilities Grant has been protected, and will total £745 million over the spending review period. Modifications can include installing ramps or widening doorways for easier wheelchair access; installing a stair lift or providing a downstairs bathroom to improve access to sleeping and sanitary facilities; or adapting heating and lighting controls to make them easier to use.

### Notes to editors

1. All councils were invited to submit bids for funds to reimburse them for work for ex-services personnel. The reimbursement of £228,750 will go to 16 local authorities who applied and have carried out adaptations in the homes of ex-service men and women. They are:

  * Amber Valley

  * Blackpool

  * Bolsover

  * Crawley

  * Durham

  * Gateshead

  * Halton

  * Hastings

  * Havering

  * Merton

  * North Norfolk

  * North Tyneside

  * Rugby

  * Stroud

  * Waltham Forest

  * York

2. The Disabled Facilities Grant is made to Local Authorities under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003 and has been non ring-fenced since April 2011.

3. The grant can be used for adaptations that provide better freedom of movement into and around the home or to provide essential facilities. An occupational therapist will look at individual circumstances and recommend the type of adaptations needed. Acceptable types of work include:

  * widening doors and installing ramps
  * providing or improving access to rooms and facilities - for example, by installing a stair lift or providing a downstairs bathroom
  * adapting heating or lighting controls to make them easier to use
  * improving or providing a suitable heating system
  * providing suitable bathroom or kitchen facilities
  * improving access to and movement around the home to enable individual to care for another person who lives in the property, such as a child.

4. Any eligible disabled person can apply for a grant through their local authority, whether they are a homeowner, private tenant or local authority tenant. The council will arrange for an occupational therapist through social services to visit the home to assess which adaptations are needed.

5. A table showing the £180 million Disabled Facilities Grant allocations for each local authority can be found under 'Related downloads' on this page: [www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingolderpeople/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingolderpeople/).

6. Other support for current and former members of the Armed Forces include:

  * providing tailored support through housing experts visiting military bases to explain to service personnel how they can apply for new homes being built over the next few years
  * plans to change the law to give former servicemen and women with urgent housing needs high priority on social housing waiting lists - these plans are currently out for consultation; and
  * proposals to give councils greater freedom to dispose of vacant council homes at Right to Buy discounts to local people - which could include existing or former military personnel.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2059517,Communities can celebrate London 2012 in style with street games,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today urged communities across the country to get 2012 off to a running start and make it their New Year's resolution to host their own street games to celebrate the London Olympics in style.

The Minister called on the nation's neighbourhoods to dive into the spirit of next year's Games and host their own sporting events, whether in people's back gardens, on nearby playing fields, in local community centres - or even in their streets.

To make it easier for these events to be staged, he has pressed councils to carry the torch for a fitter, sport-filled 2012 by ensuring there are no health and safety hurdles stopping communities in their tracks.

And where bad weather threatens to stop play, Mr Shapps called on local authorities to consider how community halls could become possible venues.

The Government is already targeting the myths that often prevent neighbourhoods from putting on their own events. These include:

  * The need for a licence - organisers do not need a licence unless they plan to sell alcohol or charge for a performance.
  * Fees charged for road closures - the Government has scrapped guidance that was used by councils as a means of charging people wanting to close their road - now councils will charge nothing for this.
  * The need to buy expensive road signs and insurance - some councils lend signs and cones to organisers, while Streets Alive has downloadable signs on its website, which also includes advice on insurance.
  * Plans to scrap the need for Temporary Entertainment Licences, making it easier for people to play music at their street games - under government proposals, rules requiring people to apply, and sometimes pay up to £35, for licences for many events where there is little or no risk of trouble would be scrapped.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""As the country starts warming up for the 2012 Olympics, I want to be sure that no one has to wrestle with bureaucracy to be able to mark the occasion in style.
> 
> ""So I'm today calling on communities to make it their New Year's resolution to get on the starting line and prepare for their own street games. And because all too often red tape gets in the way of these events taking place, I want councils to make it their goal in 2012 to high jump over regulations and fly the flag for those neighbourhoods wanting to take part.
> 
> ""Hosting street games will both help towards securing an enduring legacy for London 2012 of greater participation in sport, and give everyone a chance to take part in a fitting tribute to the Olympics. I would urge councils and communities across the country to start planning now.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1722128,Communities should prepare for their Right to Build,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced that local rural housing projects that secure the support of 75 per cent of voters will get the go-ahead without the need for a specific application for planning permission.

This is the next step in bringing forward a Community Right to Build, which will move power from Whitehall to residents to give the green light to new developments that have overwhelming local support and meet minimum planning criteria.

The Minister today urged rural communities to work together to prepare for this new Right to Build, and examine how it can be used to deliver the homes their areas need.

The Government had initially proposed a higher 90 per cent threshold for local Right to Build approval, but it was soon clear that there was a strong preference for a lower threshold across the board.

Mr Shapps believes this new support threshold strikes the right balance - enabling communities to bring forward the development they want while still ensuring that developments are supported by the overwhelming majority of the wider community.

The shift in power through Community Right to Build from Government to communities will be included in the forthcoming Localism Bill, to be introduced later this autumn. It will mean local people can deliver the homes they really want, rather than being told their own expansion doesn't fit in with the local council's plans and therefore cannot go ahead.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""No-one knows the challenges that rural communities face better than the people who live there. I want to give them the power and the freedom to tackle local issues with local solutions through the Community Right to Build, so they can give the go-ahead to the new homes their area needs.
> 
> ""That's why new Community Right to Build organisations will not need to make specific planning applications for new developments. Those plans that get 75 per cent support in local referendums will no longer need to go to the Town Hall for approval - instead, work can begin much more quickly.
> 
> ""I've listened to the views of the public that responded strongly to our consultation, and I believe this threshold strikes the right balance between enabling communities to go ahead with their plans for expansion, while at the same time ensuring the support of the overwhelming majority of the wider community. And I hope it gives rural towns and villages across the country the prompt they need to prepare for a new Right to Build as a solution to the housing challenges they face.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1833125,Communities to be given a Right to Reclaim Land,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced plans to give members of the public the right to reclaim and develop hundreds of acres of unused public sector land and buildings, which are currently trapped in a bureaucratic quagmire. The new Community Right to Reclaim Land will help communities to improve their local area by using disused publicly owned land for new development.

There is currently a large amount of public sector land that could be developed for new homes, businesses and leisure facilities. The amount of previously developed land owned by public bodies is more than twice the size of Leicester - but a complicated and ineffective system makes it difficult to find out where the land is and who owns it, and even harder to request to use it.

By the summer, a new one-stop shop will provide citizens with information about empty land and buildings they can develop to improve their local area. The new online tool will combine information from existing databases to form the bedrock of a new Community Right - the Right to Reclaim Land - which will also include an improved system for members of the public to request that empty public sector land or buildings are sold off, so they can be brought back into use.

The current system for requesting the sale of public land and buildings is so obscure and restrictive that it is rarely used, with only one successful application in the past 13 years.

In the future, members of public will be able to access information about land owned by a much broader range of public bodies, and the system for considering requests will be streamlined, with all but the most sensitive decisions considered alongside other planning casework, instead of Government Ministers.

As part of today's move, Mr Shapps is also calling on Government departments to make more information about their surplus land available. To kick-start this drive towards greater transparency, and set an example for what the public sector can do, the Minister is publishing, for the first time, a detailed list of all the land and property assets owned by the national housing and regeneration agency, so communities can see where land and property is located, and its status.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's completely unacceptable that people have to walk past derelict land and buildings every day, in the knowledge that there's almost no prospect they will be brought back into use, and there's absolutely nothing they can do about it. For years, communities who have attempted to improve their local area by developing disused public land and buildings have found themselves bouncing off the walls of bureaucratic indifference - their attempts to do something positive for their community thwarted by a system that has proved totally ineffective.
> 
> ""So starting today, we are introducing a new Right to Reclaim Land. Under our plans, communities will no longer be kept in the dark about what land is available; instead they will be able to see at the click of a button what local opportunities there are for development. And rather than requests to use that land being blocked and ignored, ordinary people who make a case to improve their local area will be listened to.
> 
> ""But this is only the start - we are no longer prepared to accept the state-sponsored decline of local communities. I am determined that this system works, so I want to hear any suggestions for improvements, and if necessary I will use legislation to make sure it is local communities who reap the rewards of opportunities to develop local land and buildings that currently lie unused.""

The new Community Right is part of a wider package of measures by the Government to give more powers to councils and communities, so they can make their own decisions on housing and development issues.

Better information about disused land will complement the new Community Right to Build, which will offer communities the chance to give the green light to new developments without the need for specific planning applications.

Local people, working alone or with their communities, will be able to come together to build the homes, shops and businesses the area needs. These new community rights will offer people a solution to their housing needs in villages, towns and cities up and down the country. If communities support locally-led proposals, they will be able to regenerate abandoned urban sites or build homes in countryside communities, ensuring they remain vibrant places to live.

A significant proportion of existing sites that are suitable for development are sitting in public land banks - there are over 16,000 hectares of previously developed land owned by councils and public bodies, and on central Government land alone there is enough capacity to build 60,000 new homes over the next 10 years.

Information about public sector land and property is currently limited - records are only partial and are spread across different databases that are not easily accessible to the public. By the summer, this data will become much more transparent and easier to access. Information from existing databases will be combined and made accessible from one user-friendly website. The amount of information about public land will also increase, as more public bodies begin adding information about their assets.

Alongside this greater transparency, a new process to request the sale of public land and property will be in place by the end of the summer. New regulations will also significantly expand the number of public bodies that can be approached with a request to sell their assets.

### Notes to editors

1. By end of May 2011, information from separate databases about public sector land and property will be made available to the public via the new user-friendly website. This data will be supplemented by information from other public bodies that have surplus land and empty properties.

2. The Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 gives members of the public the power to request that empty public sector land owned by local authorities and a limited number of other public bodies is sold off. This system is currently called the 'public request to order disposal' (PROD). It is a little known and little used power. By end of May 2011, regulations will be laid to enable this power to become a part of the Community Right to Reclaim Land. There will also be a dedicated page on the DCLG website providing all the necessary information to explain how members of the public citizens can use the system to submit a request.

3. A detailed list of all the land and property assets owned by The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) will be published today. Land and property assets are categorised by local authority area, type of asset, size and address, as part of its commitment to the government's transparency agenda. The information could enable local authorities, Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) and community-based organisations to identify and assemble land development opportunities for their area. It will also make it possible for members of the public to scrutinise the land and buildings owned by the national housing and regeneration agency, making it easier for communities to see where HCA-owned property is located and its status. The list of assets is available to download from the HCA website at [www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/transparency](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/transparency) (external link).

4. In 2008 there were an estimated 63,750 ha of previously developed land that might be available for redevelopment, of which 28,810 ha were suitable for housing. An estimated 1.2m homes could potentially be provided on this land. Around 10 per cent of all previously developed land was owned by a local authority, and 16 per cent owned by other public bodies. This means there is an estimated 6,400 ha of previously developed land owned by local authorities, and 10,200 ha owned by other public bodies, which could be redeveloped for the benefit of communities. Of this, an estimated 3,200 ha of land owned by local authorities was judged to be suitable for housing while an estimated 4,300 ha of land owned by other public bodies were judged to be suitable for housing.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1789727,Councillors being given more powers than ever to become local champions,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today outlined how radical new legislation will make councillors more powerful than ever before and help them become local champions.

He launched a national search for talented 'school gate mums and dads' to step forward and make real change to real lives in their communities.

![embed: ](http://www.youtube.com/v/dYNGsL4JYjM?fs=1&hl=en_GB&rel=0)

The Localism Bill, to be published shortly, will help place councillors centre stage in their communities with more clout than ever before to get things done for the people they serve on a whole range of issues. Measures will include freeing councillors from restrictions that prevent them from championing local issues, allowing councils to return to the Committee system meaning all councillors are directly involved in decision-making and a new simpler and transparent standards regime ending the system that Ministers believe fuelled petty and malicious complaints.

So Mr Shapps launched a new talent show called 'Your Community Needs You' - a search for community champions, people with the X Factor who have a track record of getting things done in their area. He is encouraging them to put their names on the ballot papers for next year's local elections.

He today kicked off this search for local stars by encouraging 'school gate mums and dads' - people with energy and passion, people who know what needs doing and are used to going out and doing it - to bring their skills and experience to bear and consider standing for election.

Mr Shapps argued that for many, becoming a councillor is the last thing on their mind, and that they will have previously been put off by the steady erosion of power of councillors and the endless restrictions placed on them in recent years.

But with the pressing need to get the nation's finances back on track every community faces tough choices and needs talented people who are part of their community to make these decisions. Mr Shapps said there has never been a better reason or time for these talented people to put themselves forward.

Mr Shapps made clear his admiration for those existing councillors who despite the restrictions placed on them have continued to champion their communities. But with these restrictions set to become a thing of the past, the Minister said he wants to see a new generation to join this army of community champions.

In a speech to parents and students at Bishop's Hatfield School Grant Shapps said:

> ""There are tens of thousands of people across the country - like the 'school gate mums and dads' - already doing great things for their local area. They have a track record of getting things done - whether fundraising, volunteering as Governors or running clubs.
> 
> ""They have energy, passion, know what needs doing and go out and do it, and are networked like never before. But many would have never considered being a councillor and would be put off by the petty rules and mindless bureaucracy too often associated with being a councillor.
> 
> ""Times are changing and Government is ending Whitehall's iron grip over local communities - pushing power down from Whitehall to your Town Hall and from Downing Street to your street.
> 
> ""Local councillors will be placed centre stage with more clout than ever before to get things done for the communities they serve. After years of tying the hands of local councillors we are now setting them free.
> 
> ""But we need talented people who can seize the opportunities this seismic shift in the balance of power presents. So my message to school gate mums and dads and other community champions is clear. Your Community Needs You. I know this talent show might be less glamorous than the X Factor but if you win the prize is huge. You will be able to make real changes to real lives in your own community.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2067495,Councils should help older people live at home for longer,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today called on councils to use every opportunity under the New Deal for Older People to give elderly people more choice and control over where they live, so they are not pressured to sell their home or move into residential care.

Mr Shapps said councils should learn from the Government-backed FreeSpace project piloted by the London Borough of Redbridge, where elderly homeowners will be helped to downsize to rented accommodation that better suits their needs, but without requiring them to sell their home.

Under the scheme the council will arrange for elderly people to move into rented accommodation, and take responsibility for maintaining and letting their property at an affordable rate. Homeowners will benefit from the rental income from their home, which will be passed back into their estate at an agreed date.

Ministers have hailed the win-win project as a future model for councils across the country - helping the elderly keep their homes while living in more comfortable accommodation, and at the same time increasing the availability of affordable family homes. 

Under the New Deal for Older People the Government is providing funding for home adaptations so older people can live in their own homes for longer, and backing innovative schemes that offer elderly people the assistance they need to live independently.

Mr Shapps also confirmed allocations of an additional £20 million for Disabled Facilities Grants - bringing the total to £200 million this year. The grants enable councils to fund adaptations to peoples' homes, helping people live independently and saving them from an unnecessary stay in hospital or going into residential care.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Too often older people struggling to live in their homes feel they have no option but to move into residential care. Giving older people more choice where they live is the right thing to do - but it also makes economic sense. Up to £26,000 can be saved each year for each person by offering an alternative to residential care.
> 
> ""So I would urge all councils to help people move into suitable accommodation, or use the funding we have made available to make simple alterations so older people can stay in the home they love close to family and friends.""

The Government has given £51 million towards handypersons services, and is extending support for Home Improvement Agencies who will provide help and advice to older and disabled people, housing associations and charities, including:

  * housing advice, including help to move to more suitable accommodation if needed

  * small home repairs, home safety and security adaptations

  * energy efficiency advice; and

  * arranging for adaptations and home repairs to be made, including grab rails, stair-lifts and major work such as ground floor extensions.

These agencies also offer hospital discharge services - ensuring older people leaving hospital care are given the support they need to be able to recuperate in the comfort of their own homes.  
  
Ministers have made the call to councils on the day the University of Cambridge published a report praising the Government-funded service that offers expert advice to older people about how they can meet their changing housing needs. 

The report said the FirstStop service is the type of resource that would become vital if the country is to withstand the emotional and financial challenges of a growing elderly population.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1891338,Don't let health and safety myths get in the way of Royal Wedding celebrations,"With one week to go until the Royal Wedding, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today reassured communities across the country that it's not too late to celebrate with their own party.

He urged people not to listen to those who may claim that health and safety laws prevent them celebrating the Big Day - when this is simply not true.

Certain councils or health and safety officials may choose to impose height restrictions on bunting, and rules on how bunting should be hung in the street. But this is despite there being no central rules on this whatsoever.

So in new, extra advice for party hosts, Mr Shapps made very clear that neighbours will be able to put bunting up in their streets how they wish, without fear of it being ripped down by health and safety officials.

The guidance also makes clear that for most celebrations in small streets the local council only needs to know where it is taking place and when the road will be closed so they can plan around it.

Mr Shapps also clarified that getting permission to close a street for a party also gives the green light for a neighbourhood to decorate as they want - including with bunting.

If residents can't hold a party in their street, they can instead hold a local 'street meet' gathering in a local open space, driveway or cul-de-sac without facing any form-filling at all.

The guidance, updated this month, also clears up other myths including:

  * **The need for entertainment and food licences**: organisers do not need an entertainment licence unless they plan to sell alcohol or charge for a performance, and no food licence is required for an ordinary party;
  * **Fees charged for road closures**: the Government has scrapped guidance that was used by councils as an excuse to charge people wanting to close their road, so now many councils will charge nothing for Royal Wedding parties; and
  * **The need to buy expensive road signs and insurance**: some councils lend signs and cones to organisers, while Streets Alive have downloadable signs available from their website, which also offers tips on insurance - although there is no requirement from central Government for party hosts to take out insurance.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Through this advice we've made clear that the bonkers health and safety rules that can prevent simple celebrations taking place need not apply to Royal Wedding parties - far from it, they can be set up with the minimum of fuss and almost no form-filling.
> 
> ""So with just one more week until Prince William and Kate Middleton's big day, there is still time for communities to organise their celebrations, whether in their street, in their local open space or even in someone's garden.
> 
> ""My message to neighbourhoods across the country is clear - if you want to celebrate the Royal Wedding, get out the bunting and start planning a party in your area.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/21329641,Downing Street hosting the self-build boom,"New help for self home builders launched at most famous address in the country

A package of new support to give as many people as possible the opportunity to build their own homes was announced today at England's most famous address by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

It comes as a new report predicts a 141 per cent rise in the mortgages available for those building their own homes over the next three years.

The Minister said that going down the self-build route was an affordable option for aspiring homeowners and shouldn't be seen as the preserve of those with deep pockets and grand designs.

A budget of £150,000 is adequate, in most instances, to get a three to four bedroom home built. The average cost of a ready-made home is now over £232,000.

Pledging to double the size of the self-build sector, Mr Shapps was joined by a glittering cast list of TV house-building experts at 10 Downing Street - assembled to offer advice to aspiring self builders on issues ranging from setting a budget and finding a site to practical tips on designing and building their own home.

A growing number of Britons are laying their own foundations with almost 14,000 new homes self-built last year - more than many individual volume housebuilders are building.

However, the self-builder's share of the market - one in ten of all new homes - is still very small by international standards.

Launching a package of measures today designed to turn this into a mass market opportunity, Mr Shapps said that for the first time, anyone wanting to don a hard hat and build their own home from scratch - whatever their budget - will have the help, advice and support they need to get started.

### Help to get started

The pros on hand at the Downing Street reception today to offer advice included:

  * Architecture Expert, Green Developer and Presenter of Grand Designs **Kevin McCloud**
  * Architect, presenter and independent advisor to the Government on empty homes **George Clarke**
  * TV builder and handyman **Tommy Walsh**
  * Architecture expert **Dan Cruickshank**
  * Writer and broadcaster on architecture **Tom Dyckhoff**
  * Property expert and presenter **Michael Holmes**, and
  * Architectural designer and sustainability expert **Charlie Luxton**.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Last year, self-builders accounted for about 14,000 new homes in this country, more than many large commercial builders. Yet our self-build industry still lags behind much of the rest of the world, with the opportunity to build your own home seen as something only for a select few.
> 
> ""That's why today, I'm pledging to back the self-build boom and support the industry to double in size over the next few years. As well as a new website giving help and advice, we're working hard to identify more land for development and have reformed the planning rules to stop people's aspirations getting tangled in red tape.
> 
> ""This package of measures is designed to ensure anyone looking to build their own home gets the support they need and with the numbers of mortgages available set to rise by a massive 141 per cent, there's never been a better time for people to lay their own foundations.""

### Supporting a growing industry

Today's website is just one of a number of measures the industry is driving forward with the support of the Government. Today the National Self Build Association reported to Government on achievements since the launch of its Action Plan last year. In particular the report highlights:

  * **Improved access to finance** - Better engagement with lenders, leading to a predicted 141 per cent rise in mortgage availability for people looking to build their own homes
  * **Making more land available** - The Government is continuing to identify more surplus land for self build projects
  * **More builders offering self build housing** - there is increasing interest from builders, developers, landowners and local authorities to support self home building across the country
  * **Cutting red tape** - such as the new support for people wanting to build their own homes in the revised National Planning Policy Framework' and
  * **Access to better information** - More information on prospective sites for projects is now available, and more accessible through the new web portal launched today.

Ted Stevens, the Chairman of the National Self Build Association (NaSBA) said:

> ""More than half the UK population would like to one day build their own homes, and around two million families are keen to get their projects off the ground in the very near future. The new self build portal will help them figure out what, realistically, they can afford to build; it will explain how their budgets can go further if they team up with other would-be self builders or do a portion of the work themselves, and it highlights the parts of the UK where it can be cheaper to find a site and construct a home.
> 
> ""The site has lots of great examples, and is crammed with practical advice and tips. We have also worked hard to ensure the information is as authoritative and independent as possible, in may ways it's like a Which Guide to Self Build, so people using it can really rely on the information that's provided.""

Kevin McCloud said:

> ""Self build is sometimes seen as a long, difficult and self-sacrificing process. But with the right planning, help and support it can be enjoyable and on collective schemes empowering. I believe we can become a nation of self builders. With the right support I believe we'd see more customised homes that reflect where they are, built to higher standards and to a better quality. We'd see people sharing skills and saving money. We'd see neighbours working together on community self build schemes and local construction economies thriving. And we'd certainly see more energy efficient buildings and a wider embracing of green technologies.""

George Clarke said:

> ""Id like it to be made much easier for a new generation of younger people to be get their self build projects off the ground. Few people realise that it is possible to build a very affordable, custom-designed home for quite a modest amount. And if young people team up with others, it's possible to make even bigger savings - perhaps reducing the cost of a new home by 30 per cent or more. So self build really can be a route to affordable housing. This new portal explains in depth how group self build schemes can be delivered and I'm sure it will help to increase the number of innovative low cost self build projects that are completed in the UK.""

Kate Coutts and Alex White, both 30, are one of the would-be self build couples attending the Masterclass. Kate said:

> ""Currently it's really difficult to find good independent information about how to best get a self build project underway. We're currently renting, and are very keen on self build as a way of getting ourselves on the first step of the housing ladder. When we looked at the portal we found it very helpful - by checking out the interactive guide we've been able to get a much clearer idea of what we might be able to afford, and how to get the most from our limited budget. Before the portal there wasn't a good independent site with all the necessary information and guidelines. The site is really useful especially with so many links to external sites, contractors, etc, and it has hugely cut down the amount of time spent researching.""

### Notes to editors

1. The new Portal can be found at: [www.selfbuildportal.org.uk](http://www.selfbuildportal.org.uk/).

2. A progress report to Government on the implementation of the Action Plan to promote the growth of self build housing (National Self Build Association March, 2012) can be found at: [www.nasba.org.uk](http://www.nasba.org.uk/).

3. The National Planning Policy Framework does a number of things to help aspiring self-builders. In particular, it:

  * Asks local planning authorities to prepare a Strategic Housing Market Assessment to assess their full housing needs and ensure that this identifies the scale and mix of housing and the range of tenures that the local population is likely to need over the plan period - including the need for housing by people who wish to build their own homes (paragraph 159), and

  * Asks local planning authorities to use their evidence base to ensure that their local plan meets the assessed needs for market and affordable housing in the housing market area in full and to deliver a wide choice of high quality homes and widen opportunities for home ownership - including people wishing to build their own homes (Paragraph 50).

4. The Self Build Homes industry contributes approximately £3.6 billion a year to the national economy. Currently self home builders are building more homes each year than many of our individual volume housebuilders, with around 13,800 self build homes completed in the UK in 2010/11.

5. Only one in ten new UK homes are self built. In some counties like Germany and Austria, numbers are as high as 70 to 80 per cent.

6. Datamonitor predicts a 141 per cent growth in gross advances for self build mortgages over the next three years, from £790m to over £1.9bn.

7. Industry launched An Action Plan to promote the growth of self build housing: the report of the Self Build Government-Industry Work Group last year. The Action Plan, which can be found at [www.nasba.org.uk](http://www.nasba.org.uk/):

  * Asked the Government to make more land available for self builders, encourage lenders to offer more finance products for those building their own home, and simplify regulations hampering the growth of the sector.
  * It challenged Industry to promote new ways of working with self builders, identify new ways to support group self build schemes and provide clear independent information online to would-be self builders via a new online self build 'portal', to enable more people to get a project underway.

8. Laying the Foundations: A Housing Strategy for England sets out the Government's plans to support social mobility and get the housing market - and in particular new house building - moving again, including a Self Build Homes programme to support and encourage more individuals and communities to build their own homes.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1932559,Eco-homes don't have to be 'eco-bling',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today warned that a lack of creativity could lead to Scandinavian-style ""eco-bling"" homes dominating our neighbourhoods over the next five years, as housebuilders prepare to go zero carbon in 2016.

He urged architects to go back to their drawing boards, and start finding ways to 'green up' the Great British home.

Mr Shapps today opened the 'Natural House', a low-carbon property developed by the Prince's Foundation at the Building Research Establishment in Watford. The property has been constructed to a traditional design using new low-carbon and low energy technologies.

There, the Minister reminded current and prospective homeowners that from 2016 all new homes must be built to a zero carbon standard. But he also argued that the ""Natural House"" demonstrates that British design will still have a place on our streets and does not need to be replaced by Scandinavian-style, 'eco-bling' properties that ""wear their green credentials for all to see"".

He therefore insisted that turning zero carbon in 2016 should not mean the end of the Great British home - whether it apes the Victorian terraces of the cities, or the cottages that dominate the streets of rural villages - which could be built to be eco-friendly just as well a the glass-fronted properties that have proved just as popular as more traditional designs.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We all know the Scandinavian-style homes that feature on property programmes - wearing their green credentials for all to see. These are popular and display a high quality of design and craftsmanship. But a lack of creativity could mean this eco-bling dominates our neighbourhoods in as little as five years - I am clear that the beginning of zero carbon does not need to mean the end of Great British design.
> 
> ""That's why between now and 2016 when all new homes must be zero carbon, I want developers and designers to go back to their drawing boards and see how they can 'green up' our traditional, British properties. People want to buy homes, not causes and just because a home is greener does not mean it can't reflect the character of the local area.
> 
> ""With the Natural House in Watford, the Prince's Foundation has proved that Great British design doesn't need to be sacrificed to make our homes zero carbon. And as we move towards 2016, I want local people themselves to have their say, working with the Design Council to shape the future designs of their area to make them cleaner and greener.""

### Notes to editors

1. On 17 May 2011, Grant Shapps published his proposals for a Zero Carbon Standard. Details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1905491](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1905496).

2. Communities now have greater opportunities to have their say on how their areas should look and feel in the future. In February 2011 Ministers confirmed that the Design Council would expand to take in many of the activities, skills, knowledge and expertise from the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, creating a one-stop shop offering a service to industry, councils and communities.

3. Grant Shapps will today visit the Natural House at the Building Research Establishment. Developed by the Prince's Trust and built to a traditional design, the Natural House has been constructed using a variety of techniques to keep it low-carbon and low-energy.

These include:

  * thermoplan blocks, which trap air in pockets to provide high levels of insulation

  * carbon-light materials including wood-framed windows, lime render on the walls and slate tiles on the roof

  * a unique ventilation system drawing fresh air into the house, with casement windows able to be fully open to let more air in on warmer days

  * the property is also finished internally using wool carpets and organic paints.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1767250,End to red tape that stopped social home improvements,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today pledged extra cash to improve the condition of social homes, helping to provide a decent home for some of the most vulnerable families across the country. Over £2bn of funding will be allocated to complete the Decent Homes programme, with the money going to councils who need it most.

Ministers believe the previous system for allocating money was overly bureaucratic, and meant councils spent too much time and expense jumping through hoops, rather than making improvements to social homes.

Mr Shapps said the money would now be allocated to councils who showed they could tackle a significant backlog of homes that need improving, rather than on the basis of a particular organisational structure or general performance criteria.

The changes to the allocation process are part of the Government's commitment to fairness, ensuring that following the tough spending review, money is directed towards frontline services and protecting the most vulnerable people in society.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Previously tenants were in the worst homes when landlords were denied Decent Homes cash because they did not play by the previous Government's rules. I believe that's completely unfair - tenants are missing out on vital improvements to their homes through no fault of their own.
> 
> ""That's why I'm changing the system so from now on the areas that need the money most will get it. And it's why despite the steps the Government is taking to tackle the record deficit, we've set aside over £2bn to make sure these homes are brought up to scratch.""

Ministers want a fair system to allocate the funding, so all councils that have a significant backlog of work will now be able to apply. Proposals published for consultation today set out the new process, and welcome the views of councils and social landlords on the best way to gather information and make fair funding decisions.

### Notes to editors

1. The Spending Review announced the Government will invest over £2bn of capital funding to help towards completing the Decent Homes programme. Funding of £1.595bn is available over the next four years to help make local authority social homes decent (with an additional £0.510bn being provided for 'gap' funding existing stock transfers). We will be working with the HCA to ensure that decent homes funding is allocated where it is needed and in order to support the self financing settlement.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1681489,Extra funding for councils who go for growth now,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today told councils that local communities who go for growth now and in the future will receive direct and substantial extra funding to spend as they wish - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or improving local facilities like playgrounds.

Housebuilding has been declining over the past few years and is at its lowest peacetime level since 1924. Taking action to address this is a priority for Government. That's why Mr Shapps has today announced that the New Homes Bonus will be introduced early in the Spending Review period.

The Minister confirmed that councils who take action now to give planning consent and support the construction of new homes where they are needed and wanted will receive direct and substantial benefit for their actions.

Mr Shapps urged councils to open up an honest and direct debate with the communities they serve about the benefits of building new homes in their area - how they can reap the benefits of development and not just the costs.

In a letter to councils Mr Shapps also confirmed that the Government is working on business rate reforms to encourage economic development, as well as reforming the Community Infrastructure Levy to provide an even clearer incentive to develop.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We have wasted no time scrapping the ineffective top-down planning system that forced unsustainable development on communities and are returning control of a much faster and more responsive planning system to local people.
> 
> ""We will not tell communities how or where to build, or how they should grow. But the New Homes Bonus will ensure that those communities that go for growth reap the benefits of development, not just the costs.
> 
> ""With housebuilding falling to its lowest level since 1924, action is needed now to build the homes the country needs. That's why these new powerful incentives to build will be introduced early in the Spending Review period. And it's why I have confirmed that those councils who go for growth by providing planning permission now will reap the rewards. So I urge councils to seize the moment and open up a debate with their communities now about the new homes they need and how they would use the new Bonus.""

The Government wants to hear the views of councils, communities and industry as it finalises the scheme. A consultation paper on the final scheme will be published following the spending review.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1857642,Extra funding to help people with disabilities stay in their home,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has confirmed that despite the tough financial climate, £180m is being given to councils to help them fund home adaptations and help those with disabilities live comfortably and independently in their own home.

Publishing details of the local authority allocations for the Disabled Facilities Grant programme in England, he confirmed that an extra £11m a year will be made available from April. The funding is allocated through councils, and the 150 with the highest level of relative need will see the amount they receive go up next year, with other areas continuing to be funded by the same amount.

And Mr Shapps announced that from April the grant will no longer be ring-fenced, giving councils maximum flexibility to support local needs.

The grant is used to help meet the cost of providing adaptations and facilities to enable people with disabilities to stay in their home - whether they are the owner or a tenant. It can be used to provide people with better access to their home and to move around it more freely or to use the essential facilities within their home so that they can manage as independently as possible.

Modifications can include installing ramps or widening doorways for easier wheelchair access; installing a stair lift or providing a downstairs bathroom to improve access to sleeping and sanitary facilities; or adapting heating and lighting controls to make them easier to use.

Changes to make it easier to care for another person who lives in the property, such as a bath-lift for a disabled child, can also be funded.

To ensure that those households most in need benefit, the amount of grant people are entitled to depends on their ability to contribute to the cost of the adaptations, except where the application is for a disabled child or young person under the age of nineteen.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Being able to remain in your own home has a significant impact upon your health, well-being and feeling of independence. Helping disabled people to live as comfortably and independently as possible in their own homes is a key commitment for this Government.
> 
> ""That is why we are increasing the Disabled Facilities Grant by £11m to £180m a year from April. In doing so, we are showing how seriously we are taking that commitment. And that despite the tough financial times, we will continue to protect those in our society who are most in need.
> 
> ""This funding will also help our Coalition Agreement commitment to help older people to live in their homes for longer through solutions such as home adaptations and community support programmes.""

Minister for Disabled People, Maria Miller said:

> ""Our commitment to help support disabled people live independent lives runs at the heart of our welfare reforms and this additional money will help deliver the greater independence that disabled people want.
> 
> ""Working with local authorities, we have also recently launched Right to Control which is a radical shake-up of the way disabled people use state funding, allowing them to buy their own support services or equipment.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Disabled Facilities Grant is made to Local Authorities under s31 of the Local Government Act 2003 and from April 2011 will be non ring-fenced.

2. Government's contribution to the grants in is £180m a year in total, an increase of 8 per cent compared to 2010-11.

  * widening doors and installing ramps

  * providing or improving access to rooms and facilities - for example, by installing a stair lift or providing a downstairs bathroom

  * adapting heating or lighting controls to make them easier to use

  * improving or providing a suitable heating system

  * providing suitable bathroom or kitchen facilities

  * improving access to and movement around the home to enable individual to care for another person who lives in the property, such as a child

4. Any eligible disabled person can apply for this grant through their local authority, whether they are a homeowner, private tenant or local authority tenant. The council will arrange for an occupational therapist through social services to visit the home to assess which adaptations are needed.

![High Street Illustration (Dermott Flynn)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2082239.jpg)Illustration by Dermott Flynn

The Government has received bids from 371 different towns to become one of 12 pilot areas, with the chance to receive a share of £1.2million to help turn around their high streets - but more importantly the backing from the Minister and Mary Portas herself.

Mr Shapps said he was excited by the ""enthusiastic and energetic"" response to the Portas Review, which has proved a catalyst for communities to come together, form Town Teams and make plans for the future of their high streets.

While the results of this competition will be announced in May, the Minister has also announced a further round of pilots to trial some of Mary's recommendations.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""I am delighted by the enthusiastic and energetic response from towns up and down the country, as they have used Mary Portas's review as a real catalyst for change to secure the future of their high streets.
> 
> ""High streets have faced stiff challenges from internet shopping and out-of-town centres, yet there is still a clear desire from communities to see them survive. We have received a fantastic 371 bids to become one of the first 12 Portas pilots.
> 
> ""That's why, as part of our Portas Plus response to Mary's review, I've launched a second round of this competition to find a further 12 pilot areas. I now look forward to watching the YouTube videos and seeing how communities have come together for myself.""

Mary Portas said:

> ""The significant work, creative energy and coming together of communities across the country that is evident in films they have made has confirmed my belief that the British public really care about their high streets. I promise to give as much back. We will work to recreate and redefine the British high street and town centre, making them places local communities are proud of.""

### 'Portas Plus' response - beyond the pilots

This programme of pilots is just one part of the Government's 'Portas Plus' response to Mary's review into the future of the high streets.

Grant Shapps has also announced:

  * a £1million Future High Street X-Fund, which will be awarded to areas with the most creative and effective schemes to rejuvenate their town centres;
  * a National Markets Day, launching a National Markets Fortnight, to celebrate the role markets can play and offer budding entrepreneurs the chance to test their business ideas; and
  * a £500,000 fund for Business Improvement Districts, to help town centres access loans for their set-up costs

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1696500,Fearless local scrutiny will remain,"Summary: Letter from the local government minister Grant Shapps in response to a letter in the Financial Times (August 20 2010) regarding the Audit Commission.

Sir,

It is not the case that the public's right to ensure proper scrutiny over councils is being weakened by the new Government's plans to disband the Audit Commission, as suggested in your letter's page yesterday.

In fact, it is being greatly strengthened by the greater transparency we are introducing into local government to make it accountable to the people they serve, not to Ministers in Whitehall.

We are giving local people a 'right to know' how and where their money is being spent through a new requirement to publish spending, contracts and tenders over £500 online - and my own Department is leading the way in showing how this can expose waste and inefficiency.

Nothing in what we have announced changes the fundamental principle of auditor independence. Local audits will follow a statutory framework overseen by the National Audit Office, with checks and balances that will avoid conflicts of interest and ensure robust and fearless scrutiny by auditors. Furthermore, we are planning to introduce stringent safeguards for providing assurances on the auditor appointment, while providing the public a right of challenge.

The important role of district audit will remain, and there will be a strengthened role for the Local Government Ombudsman to champion taxpayers who face individual cases of municipal maladministration.

It is already the case that private firms undertake some audit work for councils - we are looking to end the remaining public sector monopoly. Much to the disquiet of councils, the Audit Commission's audit fees have been steadily rising in recent years, and greater competition would help drive down these costs down.

Our plans are part of an agenda of reducing unnecessary inspection and Whitehall micromanagement that will save taxpayers' money directly and indirectly, not weakening the scrutiny of local councils.

The Audit Commission is the country's fifth largest audit practice, and it has a great potential as a private body to continue to provide its expert audit skills both to the public and the private sector.

Yours faithfully,

Grant Shapps MP

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1990179,FirstBuy already helping our military families,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today congratulated the first member of the Armed Forces to benefit from the Government's FirstBuy scheme and get that all-important first foothold on the property ladder.

Terry Ferguson, a military policeman, and his wife Kerry, have bought a four-bedroom house in Donnington, near Telford. It forms part of a new Barratts development in the area, and is close to Mr Ferguson's base and his children's school.

The FirstBuy scheme will offer an alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad for nearly 10,500 first-time buyers over the next two years. With the Government and developers together offering an equity loan of up to 20 per cent, this reduces the amount of deposit first-time buyers themselves have to find - making the dream of home ownership a reality.

In his letter to Mr and Mrs Ferguson, Mr Shapps congratulates them and says he is ""delighted"" that they are the first military family to benefit from the scheme.

He said:

> ""I know that it can be difficult for serving personnel to access home ownership because of the nature of your work - I didn't want you to be disadvantaged.
> 
> ""By giving members of the Armed Forces top priority for this assistance, you are the first military family to be getting that important foothold on the property ladder through FirstBuy.
> 
> ""I am delighted to hear that you are the first to benefit. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you and your family every happiness in your new home.""

Commenting further on this first sale, Mr Shapps said:

> ""I am determined that we pull out all the stops to help anyone who wants to get on the property ladder to do so - but especially our men and women in uniform who face particular difficulty because of the nature of their work.
> 
> ""That's why in May, I held a summit with leading defence officials, banks and developers, to discuss the best ways to help members of the armed forces, and I have since ensured that all Government schemes, including the FirstBuy scheme, prioritise them for assistance.
> 
> ""I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Mr and Mrs Ferguson who are able to move into their new family home thanks to FirstBuy, and I hope they are the first of many to benefit from this and the range of other help available.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2056429,First-ever fund will offer £20 million support for single homeless people,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced a further £20 million to provide single people facing homelessness the help they need to get back on their feet and ensure that they don't have to spend time on the streets.

Mr Shapps said that under homelessness legislation, single people are often not classed as ""priority need"" cases because they have no dependents. Most local authorities do not therefore offer as much support for single homeless people. This means they can often be left with fewer housing options - forced to spend nights 'sofa surfing' at friends' houses, in their car or even on the street.

The minister wants to ensure that nobody is turned away when they are most in need. This extra £20 million will help councils to provide a helping hand to single homeless people in their areas.

Possible uses include:

  * Providing a **dedicated homelessness prevention officer** for lower priority cases to give them the advice and support they need to get their lives in order and find a new home.
  * Funding more provision of **short term emergency accommodation** to prevent them sleeping rough.
  * Improving access to suitable **privately rented accommodation** through rent bond schemes, tenancy support or specialist reconnection services.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The plight of homeless people should be on our minds all year round - not just at Christmas.
> 
> ""We're fortunate to have some of the toughest laws in the world to prevent people from ending up on our streets, and while homelessness remains lower than in 28 of the last 30 years I'm always anxious to do more.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm announcing £20million of new funding which for the first time will specifically help single homeless people, who all too often slip through the safety net. This money will be used to help prevent homelessness at an earlier stage.""

Mr Shapps is asking councils to work together locally to decide how best to use this cash to meet local needs in the most effective way possible.

A new programme of support will also be introduced to help local authorities improve their homeless prevention process for single people. Local authority homeless practitioners will offer active training on innovative ways to prevent single homelessness as part of existing services. And Homeless Link, working with other voluntary organisations, are developing a best practice letter for local authorities to help provide clear and useful advice and assistance to someone not in priority need.

The £20 million funding is in addition to the existing £400 million Preventing Homelessness Grant over the next four years and will be made available in the New Year. Further details of allocations to each partnership and regional split will be confirmed in due course.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1861991,Former coalfield areas to benefit from £30 million funding package,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced £30m to help drive out inequality and deprivation from the country's coalfields areas.

The investment, which will go directly to improving the lives and well-being of some of the most deprived communities in the country, demonstrates the Coalition Government's commitment to continuing to protect the vulnerable despite the need to tackle the budget deficit.

He said that much more must be done on the ground to see the real change that these areas need, and to close the gap between them and the rest of the country.

Mr Shapps said it was unacceptable that with many hundreds of millions of pounds having been spent on coalfield regeneration over the past decade, coalfield communities remain plagued by long term unemployment and economic recovery remains fragile.

For too long he said, regeneration activity had been led from Whitehall, and that instead residents and business leaders in the area must be in the driving seat as coalfields go into the next stage of regeneration.

So he called on councils and Local Enterprise Partnerships to drive forward their own plans for economic growth and community renewal in their areas, and pointed to partnerships already forged by the Coalfields Regeneration Trust as a model for them to follow.

The Trust has been working with a number of councils to establish locally-led projects that can help make communities sustainable to the point where they can be prosperous, viable and cohesive without continued support. The funding announced today will allow the Trust to continue their innovative projects, and put more areas on a self sustaining and locally led approach.

The announcement followed the publication of the Government's response to the Review of Coalfields Regeneration led by former Barnsley West and Penistone MP Michael Clapham. The Government has accepted many of the review's findings - including the need for continued investment in former Coalfield communities but with local authorities at the forefront, to ensure it is targeted where it is needed most.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Government's commitment to provide continuing support to communities in these areas shows that despite the tough times we are in, we continue to help those who need it most - wherever they are.
> 
> ""But the Clapham Review is quite clear: as well as providing investment, we need to make regeneration locally-led - we need to drive growth by helping local leaders strengthen their economic potential and support these communities themselves.
> 
> ""We are making a significant investment in Coalfield communities, one secured against a background of hard decisions on spending priorities. And in the current economic climate it is even more important that these resources are more tightly focused on most deprived areas.
> 
> ""Central Government is removing barriers, freeing up local authorities to spend their resources to suit local needs, and funding Local Enterprise Partnerships which for the first time bring businesses into local regeneration. So I am looking to local people, councils and businesses to play more of a role in regenerating these areas.""

### Notes to editors

1. A Review of Coalfields Regeneration, led by Michael Clapham (former MP for Barnsley and former Chair of the All-Party Backbench Group of Coalfield MPs), reported to Ministers in September 2010. The Review's purpose was to help inform the direction of future government intervention in former mining communities. The main findings from the Clapham review were:

  * some coalfield communities were still in need of specific intervention and additional support - deep-seated structural and social problems remained
  * that continued provision of the three strands of coalfields funding is essential, albeit operating in a better coordinated way and in partnership with mainstream providers to bring greater intensity of action and community participation, with an integrated programme approach
  * that local authorities should have a central role to play in the next phase of coalfields regeneration, and should be given the resources they need to deliver locally, along with more freedom to spend their money to meet local requirements and conditions
  * that Government should look again at those areas currently classed as 'former coalfield' areas to ensure that whatever resources are  available are most effectively targeted
  * that, whilst the Coalfields Enterprise Fund provides a valuable venture capital vehicle for coalfield areas, a smaller grants or loans scheme is needed to help businesses struggling to access funding in the current economic climate

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1708493,Freedom for councils to manage rented housing,"New rules could cut as many as 8,500 applications from the planning system, freeing councils to focus on local priorities rather than micro managing rented housing.

New regulations laid by Housing Minister Grant Shapps means landlords will no longer have to submit a planning application to their council when wishing to rent a property to multiple unrelated tenants, unless councils know there is a high concentration of them already in the area.

Too many Houses of Multiple Occupations with short term tenants can turn a community into a seasonal 'ghost town', harming the local economy and increasing crime and anti social behaviour.

Mr Shapps argues that the current system may drive good landlords away from the rental sector, due to the current 'one size fits all' planning approach. The submission of a planning application to the council increases costs, slows the process down and limits the availability of homes and causes a drain on council resources.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Councils understand their local area best, and they don't need burdensome rules that assume housing issues in every town, village and hamlet are exactly the same. I am also committed to safeguard the supply of rented housing - shared homes are vital for people who want to live and work in towns and cities, and are important to the economy.
> 
> ""That's why I'm giving councils greater flexibility to manage shared homes in their local area. Where there are local issues with shared homes, councils will have all the tools they need to deal with the problem - but they will avoid getting bogged down in pointless applications, and landlords won't be put off renting shared homes where they are needed.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1664130,Freedom pass' for tenants trapped in unsuitable homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today put the eight million tenants in social housing in England firmly in control of where they live and their life opportunities, with a new 'freedom pass' to move home for work, to be closer to family or for any other reason.

The Minister has pledged to introduce a new National Affordable Home Swap Scheme. For the first time this will give tenants the chance to see details of every council and housing association tenant looking to exchange homes - not just in their area but across the country.

Tenants wanting to move can face an uphill battle, pitting themselves against the record numbers of families on social housing waiting lists. They see swapping homes as their only means of escaping properties that no longer meet their needs. Sometimes it can simply be in the wrong place for their job or prospective work or tenants might just need to move to support an elderly relative for example.

This has meant that in 2008, less than a quarter of new lettings were given to existing tenants - leaving others trapped in accommodation and unable to take up opportunities to improve their lives.

Current house-swap schemes are patchy in nature, but the National Home Swap Scheme will be open to all eight million tenants in social housing in England. The new comprehensive system will help to address the contradictory current situation where over a quarter-of-a-million households live in overcrowded accommodation while a further 430,000 households are unable to easily downsize from larger properties they no longer need. This means that the nation's stock of affordable homes are inefficiently used and means a loss of opportunity for tenants.

The Minister also announced that he will work with two London landlords to explore whether they can offer a new 'Right to Move' for tenants. The London Boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham will look at whether they can develop a scheme under which some of their tenants could ask their landlord to find them a home in the area they want to live.

But Mr Shapps also made clear that if he doesn't see improvements in help for tenants to move, he will take tough action to make it happen - including a 'Right to Move' for tenants in law.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today I'm launching a 'Freedom Pass' for all eight million people in affordable housing in England. Social housing should provide more than a roof over people's heads - it should lift them out of poverty, and free them to take chances to improve the quality of their own lives. Instead, many tenants are left trapped in their own homes, while councils and housing associations turn their attention to record waiting lists.
> 
> ""This cannot continue - as we work to tackle the record budget deficit we must ensure vulnerable people benefit from, but don't become trapped by, the safety net that social housing provides.
> 
> ""That's why I'm putting tenants in the driving seat, with a new opportunity to see people like them looking to exchange social homes not just in their area but across the country, through a new National Home Swap Scheme.""

This approach is backed by a new report commissioned by Mr Shapps in 2009 and published today by the National Housing Federation (NHF). Among its many recommendations on improving social housing mobility, the report concludes that many existing tenants do not apply for a transfer because they believe they will not be re-housed due to having a lack of priority in the allocation scheme.

Instead, the NHF report finds that tenants see mutual exchange as the only realistic option for those wanting to move who do not meet a priority category for social housing - and that a national home swap scheme would help tenants in this situation.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2057825,Funding boost towards national No Second Night Out pledge,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has hailed the first steps toward a national network of homelessness support as £8 million grant funding was allocated to communities across the country to help them adopt London's flagship 'No Second Night Out' initiative.  
  
Mr Shapps recently announced plans to establish a single new national phone line and website so that people across the country will know where to go and who to call to get help for rough sleepers in their area.  
  
London's No Second Night Out pilot, introduced by the Mayor, works with members of the public to quickly identify people sleeping rough in the capital and provides them with the accommodation and support they need to get themselves off the streets.  
  
The Minister said this £8 million allocation will help local communities get the services in place to support a national roll-out of the scheme, helping to ensure that nobody across the country will be forced to sleep on the streets for more than one night.  
  
Welcoming the news, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""When economic times are tough, protecting the most vulnerable in society becomes even more important.  
  
""That's why we have dedicated £8 million to extend No Second Night Out outside the capital and make sure that anyone who finds themselves on the streets quickly gets the help they need.  
  
""A safe, warm place to stay is something that everyone should be able to rely on, so I'm delighted that 19 more areas will each receive this cash boost to help make sure that no-one will need to spend more than one night sleeping rough.""

Nineteen communities across England are to get up to £250,000 each, delivered through the £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund, which was set up to help support the national rough sleeping strategy, [Vision to end rough sleeping: No Second Night Out nationwide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/visionendroughsleeping).  
  
Commenting, Sharon Allen, Chair of the Fund's Grants Panel said:

> ""In these difficult times, the funding announced today will help charities provide the vital support that many homeless people need to get back on their feet.  
  
""The quality of applications and demand for help was extremely high. However, I am pleased that these grants will help protect essential services and develop new, more effective ways to stop people living on our streets.""

Charities in the following areas are receiving funding to adopt No Second Night Out:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1894564,Government backs self-builders,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced that the Government will 'put its money where its mouth is' and help more people to realise their dream of building their own home.

Speaking at Grand Designs Live 2011, Mr Shapps said that he wanted self build to become a mainstream housing option - and that Government would play its part by making available publicly owned land for use by ordinary people to build their own homes.

As a group self-builders are already Britain's largest housebuilder, accounting for about one in five of Britain's new homes each year; but barriers and red tape have led to the UK having one of the lowest proportions of new homes built by self-builders in Europe.

Mr Shapps said he wanted to see more land being made available - both private and public - to enable more individual and community self build schemes. He called on private investors to bring forward plots, and for local authorities and Housing Associations to show their support.

The Minister said central Government would lead the way: he will shortly announce the first publicly-owned sites to be made available to housebuilders to include plots exclusively for self-builders.

This will be part of wider Government measures announced in the Budget to increase the amount of land made available for housebuilding, including to self-builders, which the Minister hopes will bring self-building into the mainstream and stop it being ""the preserve of the privileged few"".

It also forms part of Mr Shapps's drive to remove barriers and strip away bureaucracy which, he argues, have for too long thwarted the aspirations of people who want to build their own home.

In February he launched a new Industry-Government working group - led by the National Self-Build Association - to advise the Government on what action is needed to reduce barriers, including the burden of regulation and the lack of access to land and development finance.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Self builders deliver affordable, greener and more innovatively-designed homes; and make a big contribution to the number of new homes built in this country, yet there is scope to significantly increase the number of self built homes in the UK - both for individual households and for community-driven projects.
> 
> ""I want to turn around the fortunes of self-builders by cutting the red tape and bureaucracy they often face and make self build a reality for many more people. I'm encouraged by the ongoing work of our self-build working group, which is making good progress in developing an action plan to reduce the barriers that aspiring self-builders often face. These efforts will help bring self-build into the mainstream, and not simply be the preserve of the privileged few.
> 
> ""And today, I can confirm that the Government will lead the way to promote more self build housing with plots available exclusively for self-builders on public sector land.
> 
> ""This will sit alongside the efforts we are already making to reduce the burden of regulation on the house building industry and through the Localism Bill to put power in the hands of communities up and down the country. We're enabling them to give the green light to new developments through the Community Right to Build, and simplifying the overly-bureaucratic planning system.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1778632,Government cutting councils free from 'nanny state apron strings',"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps is urging councils to move away from Whitehall control and make the most of the new freedoms they have been given.

In a speech to council leaders in Marylebone, Mr Shapps argued that years of centralisation had left some authorities in a ""strait jacket"".

While many councils were embracing these reforms, the Minister warned that others had developed a ""Stockholm Syndrome"" - that, tied to the ""nanny state apron strings"", they continue to look to central Government to tell them what to do rather than deciding for themselves.

Instead, the Minister said all councils should make the most of the freedoms they are being given, and introduce bold and new ways of working to deliver not for Whitehall, but for their residents.

_A transcript will be available shortly._

To illustrate the new freedoms that councils now have, Mr Shapps cut swathes of red tape engulfing one of Westminster City Council's buildings and recycled piles of papers detailing the regulations that Westminster are looking to scrap.

The Minister's comments came as Westminster City Council revealed that they spend nearly three quarters of a million pounds reporting to Government - the equivalent of the salaries of 26 teachers, 28 social workers or 44 street cleaners.

Mr Shapps pointed to a range of measures that have been taken to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and red tape that councils face, including:

  * the abolition of Comprehensive Area Assessments and Local Area Assessments
  * a 'General Power of Competence', meaning councils can do whatever they want as long as it meets what residents want and is legal
  * the removal of all ring-fencing from local Government grants - giving councils the freedom over the funds they receive, allowing them to work with their residents to decide how best to spend it.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2140521,Government on target to smash public land ambition,"Land identified to build more than 100,000 homes

Whitehall departments are set to smash the Prime Minister's ambition to release previously-used public land for building the homes this country needs, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.  
  
New figures show that Ministers have identified enough surplus public land, such as empty offices, unused storage or empty public service buildings, to build up to 102,000 homes.  
  
This means the Government is already well on track to exceed the Prime Minister's ambition to release enough surplus land for 100,000 homes by 2015 - with more to follow.  
  
Organisations across the public services, including the NHS, Ministry of Defence and Department for Transport, will now play a critical role in helping to build the new homes that communities want and that the country needs.  
  
Examples of brownfield and previously used sites set to be released and sold for new homes include:

  * **Princess Marina Hospital, Northampton.** This NHS site has been sold and has outline planning consent for 550 homes including 12 flats for junior doctors.
  * **Foxhill, Bath.** The former Ministry of Defence base could provide over 600 homes.
  * **Hertford East coal yard.** Land in the Department for Transport estate with potential capacity for 50 homes.
  * **RAF Brampton, Huntingdonshire.** The former Ministry of Defence base could provide up to 400 homes.
  * **Leicester Frith Farm, Lady Hay Road, Leicester.** Former farm buildings sold by the Department of Health with the potential for conversion and around 10 homes.
  * **Long Benton, Newcastle.** Land formerly used for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' veterinary investigation centre, will deliver around 50 housing units with a minimum 12 affordable homes.
  * **Calvert Lane, Hull Springbank.** Part of the Department for Transport estate; could support up to 105 homes.
  * **Erskine Barracks, Wilton.** The former Ministry of Defence barracks could provide up to 450 homes. 

### More to do

With the public sector owning an estimated 40 per cent of larger sites suitable for development, Grant Shapps is determined that Whitehall can go further.  
  
He has pledged that Government departments will continue to identify and make available as many brownfield and previously used sites as possible for more much-needed homes, and work closely with the Homes and Communities Agency to make land ready for sale as soon as possible while still ensuring best value for money for the taxpayer.  
   
To help developers make the most of the sites on offer, Mr Shapps will also look to extend the use of the innovative ""Build Now, Pay Later"" deal to as many previously-used sites as possible - allowing them to start work on thousands of new homes without the initial expense of buying the land.  
  
Ministers are also committed to making information about surplus public land freely available, so that local people can see what opportunities exist to advance projects and meet local needs - be it for free schools, businesses or new homes.  
   
Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Government is one of the country's biggest landowners - it's only right that we make the best use of our assets, and I can't think of a better use than building the homes this country needs.  
   
""We're already on track to smash the Prime Minister's ambition to release previously-used public land for housing: enough land has already been identified to support more than 102,000 homes. But we're not stopping there - I'm determined to continue looking for more sites suitable for housebuilding.  
  
""And as this work continues we'll support developers getting on site quickly, through the innovative Build Now, Pay Later deal. This gives builders access to land they only pay for after the homes are built, laying the foundations for new homes and neighbourhoods right across the country.""

The Government has put a range of measures in place to boost housebuilding.

  * The Prime Minister recently announced an extra £150 million to Get Britain Building, bringing the total fund to £570 million, to get work started on stalled sites and build up to 16,000 new homes.
  * The £4.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme is set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes; and
  * The NewBuy Guarantee scheme will help get the market moving, by giving thousands the opportunity to buy their dream home with a fraction of the deposit they currently require.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1918978,Government support remains in place to help people stay in their homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has said that a wide range of support is available to support people threatened with homelessness, in particular struggling homeowners. It is imperative that people seek help and advice as early as possible. It comes as new figures out today show that 11,350 households were accepted as owed a main homelessness duty in the first three months of the year.

He said that whilst it was good news that the number remained at historically low levels and those households in temporary accommodation continued to fall, tackling homelessness remains a Government priority. That is why deliberate steps were taken at the Spending Review to protect the £400m homelessness grant to support local authorities and the voluntary sector, enabling them to support vulnerable individuals and families.

Those seeking advice can visit the Directgov website, speak to the charity - Shelter, call the National Debtline or visit their local Citizens Advice Bureau or local authority. We have continued support for the National Homelessness Advice Service that ensures front-line advice workers have the support they need to tackle homelessness effectively.

And Government has committed to removing the restrictions on local authorities to give them greater flexibility in prioritising housing stock in their area. Proposals in the Localism Bill, currently before Parliament, will allow them to better serve families with a temporary housing need by offering them a place in the private sector - which with a minimum tenure of 12 months would provide them with a secure footing on which to re-build their finances.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today's figures underline how the recession has brought difficult times for lots of people. I urge anyone who thinks they may be at risk of losing their home to take action immediately. There is help available and repossession should only ever be the very last resort. No one in financial difficulty should be embarrassed to seek help if they need it and worried homeowners should speak to their mortgage lender immediately.
> 
> ""There are challenges ahead for homeowners in 2011 - so the most important thing that Government can do is to continue our efforts to tackle the record deficit. By doing this we can avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates, and keep the pressure off homeowners facing financial hardship.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1821586,Help for older tenants wanting to move,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today offered older tenants struggling to manage and heat their large family homes a dedicated officer to find them smaller properties more suited to their needs.

The Minister argued that this will give these people the key to finding a home they can enjoy, not endure - and can give them the security and dignity they deserve.

Mr Shapps has announced a multi-million pound cash boost to landlords' efforts to better ensure their homes continue meet the needs of their residents.

Ministers are clear that they will not force people to move - but want to provide a helping hand to those wanting to do so.

There are 430,000 under-occupied social homes in England - where tenants have two or more bedrooms more than they require. In many cases, these properties are occupied by elderly tenants whose children have since grown up and moved out.

With more room than they actually need, many of these residents can become prisoners in their own homes, finding it a struggle to look after and heat the properties that are now too big for them to manage.

So Mr Shapps has today confirmed that councils from across the country managing the largest number of homes will get a share of £13million to make it easier for those tenants wanting to move from larger family homes to smaller, more manageable homes, to do so.

Councils will be able to use this funding as they see fit to better meet the needs of their tenants, with measures such as:

  * A dedicated officer to help find residents a suitable new home
  * A moving service to help tenants with every aspect of moving, from joining them on viewings to organising packing and removal services
  * Handymen to decorate and make repairs to their new home, including putting up shelves and installing white goods

Mr Shapps also outlined how he is looking to back all councils across the country with a dedicated new national action team based at the Chartered Institute of Housing, available to offer practical support and advice to those councils looking to help tenants wanting to move.

Those tenants in larger properties that are keen to downsize will also benefit from greater opportunities to swap with some of the quarter of a million households in overcrowded accommodation.

In particular the Localism Bill, currently before Parliament, includes measures to make it easier for social housing tenants to move through a new National Home Swap Scheme.

And with 1.8 million households on social housing waiting lists, many of them families, this funding will also help unlock larger homes for those in greatest need.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Older people can become the victims of their own changed circumstances, as the homes they have lived in for years become places to endure, not enjoy. As children grow up and fly the nest, these tenants can often find themselves trapped in larger family homes that no longer meet their needs.
> 
> ""That's why I'm giving these residents the chance to start a new life in a new home that better meet their changing needs. Fifty councils from across the country will get a share of £13million to boost their efforts to make it easier for those wanting to downsize to do so.
> 
> ""With a quarter of a million families in overcrowded accommodation and 1.8million households languishing on waiting lists, this will also help unlock larger family homes that are in such high demand.""

Sarah Webb, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said:

> ""There are over four million social homes across England and these are incredibly important to current and future tenants, communities and tax-payers. They provide a stable platform from which millions of families are able to find work, send children to school, and contribute to their local neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""With millions more people looking to secure a council or housing association house we need to ensure we are making the most of the homes we've got - this is just as important as building new housing.
> 
> ""That is why CIH is delighted to be working with government to deliver this practical help to support people who want to move to a new home that better suits their changing needs and aspirations.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2134775,Help to get boxed-in generation up the property ladder,"Minister pledges to help those growing out of their properties

The boxed-in generation - people unable to upsize their home but who have also outgrown their first property - will for the first time benefit from support to help them move up the housing ladder, Grant Shapps said today. In a speech to housebuilders, the Housing Minister argued that a generation of first time buyers and families with children are unable to do what their parents did and move homes as their needs grow.

A recent survey from Findaproperty.com found that almost a third of parents find their current home is too small to accommodate their family - rising to 40 per cent for younger families where the parents are aged between 18 and 34.

### Government action to help the boxed in generation

Mr Shapps said that for the first time, these overlooked owners will now get the help they need to move from their current abode to a new address - through the NewBuy Guarantee - while also freeing up properties suitable for aspiring first time buyers.

The NewBuy Guarantee is not confined to first-time buyers but is designed to help anyone looking to buy a newly-built property - and is expected to help up to 100,000 prospective and current homeowners.

Through this innovative new scheme, instead of a typical buyer requiring a £40,000 deposit to buy a £200,000 home, they will now only need £10,000. The scheme - which had its first sale this week - is available for homes of up to £500,000.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years increasing numbers of people have outgrown their homes but been unable to move, and first-time buyers have been unable to buy.
> 
> ""They know who they are. Hardworking people who bought their home when they were single, maybe met someone, fell in love and now have a couple of kids. They expected to trade up - because that's what their parents were able to do. But now they're boxed-in, home outgrown. Stuck in a flat, when really want they want is a family home.
> 
> ""The NewBuy Guarantee will give our second-time buyers a second chance, as this is the first scheme of its kind not confined to first time buyers, but available to anyone looking to buy a newly-built home.
> 
> ""We don't want Britain to be a place of housing have nots, we want people to have room to grow. The NewBuy Guarantee will do just that.""

HomeBuilders Federation Executive Chairman Stewart Baseley said:

> ""Reducing the deposit needed for a new home to an affordable level is a fantastic opportunity for many people who have been for too long frustrated. It will also open up the market, creating work for house building companies large and small and boost the economy as a whole.""

### A NewBuy Guarantee

Launched just six weeks ago, the NewBuy Guarantee is already starting to open up the market, with four lenders offering 95 per cent mortgages on new-build properties by up to nine leading housebuilders.

They are:

  * **Natwest**, who offer 95 per cent Loan-to-Value mortgages at under five per cent interest on properties built by Barratt, Bellway, Bovis, Linden Homes, Persimmon, Redrow and Taylor Wimpey;
  * **Barclays**, who offer 95 per cent Loan-to-Value mortgages on properties built by Barratt, Bellway, Bovis, Persimmon, Redrow and Taylor Wimpey;
  * **Nationwide**, who offer 95 per cent Loan-to-Value mortgages on properties built by Barratt, Bovis, Bellway, Crest Nicholson, Fairview, Linden Homes, Persimmon, Redrow and Taylor Wimpey;
  * **Halifax**, who offer 95 per cent Loan-to-Value mortgages on properties built by Barratt, Bellway, Bovis, Crest Nicholson, Cala Homes, Linden Homes, Persimmon, Redrow Homes, and Taylor Wimpey

And over the next few weeks a number of other major lenders are expected to join the NewBuy Guarantee, working with a wide range of builders.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2107181,Helping tenants take control,"Plans to make it easier for council tenants to take control of their local neighbourhood and services were announced today by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

Mr Shapps challenged tenants who feel their landlords have neglected their neighbourhood to exercise their rights and take matters into their own hands in the spirit of last year's riot clean-up crews.

The Minister today published plans to strengthen and streamline two key rights that can help tenants achieve this.

The Right to Manage gives tenants the chance to take over the day-to-day management of housing services such as cleaning, repairs, refurbishment and security to deliver a more responsive, better quality and value for money service for their community.

New proposals will streamline the piles of paperwork involved in transferring management responsibilities to a tenant organisation, speeding up the handover process.

The Right to Transfer allows tenants to request the ownership of council homes in their neighbourhood to be transferred from the council to a local housing association. This could be because tenants believe this new landlord could provide better services like cleaning and security or bring more investment into their area such as improvement to peoples homes and the environment.

At the moment tenants can put forward a case for transfer, but councils have no obligation to consider their proposals. The changes proposed today will strengthen these rights, requiring councils to work with tenants to explore transfer requests.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Last year's 'broom army' action in the aftermath of the riots demonstrated the real difference a community can make when they come together for the good of their area. The rights I'm strengthening today can put decision making power into the hands of the tenants who know their neighbourhoods best.
> 
> ""I want to make it easier than ever for council tenants to take charge of local services, from minor repairs to major regeneration. And it will no longer be acceptable for councils to dismiss tenants' proposals for improvement out of hand.
> 
> ""Nobody knows the needs of a neighbourhood better than the local community. Now I want to see tenants use these powers to prove us right.""

Communities across the country are already taking advantage of their Right to Manage their area:

  * The 1960s Bloomsbury Estate in Birmingham has been transformed by the tenants themselves, through using their Right to Manage. The tenant-led management board set a local 'Bloomsbury Standard' for improvement to homes that exceeds the Decent Homes Standard. They have also rebuilt a number of homes and a new Lottery-funded leisure complex. Since taking responsibility for the estate, the Board has boosted rent arrears recovery and saved £750,000 over five years through better productivity.

  * Tenants took up management of Childwall Valley Estate, South Liverpool, in 2000 in response to the council's 'emergency repairs only' policy. They are working to reduce anti-social behaviour with the police and Citizens Advice Bureau, and community wardens now work with work with local young people. They have also demolished the unpopular high rise blocks in the area to make way for new homes, and demand for properties on the estate now far exceeds supply.

  * In New Barracks, Salford the Tenant Management Cooperative have introduced community activities including street parties and children's playschemes, raised funds for installing play equipment, maintained the local park area, and contributed half the cost to installing CCTV on the estate.

  * And since the Pembrooke Estate Plymouth was taken over by tenants in 1994, crime rates have fallen, a Youth Service has been set up to train excluded school pupils and other vulnerable youngsters, and residents consider the estate to be well managed, clean and safe. They are now in charge of a £5 million refurbishment programme.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation runs until 23 May 2012, and comments are being invited from a wide range of consultees from across the local authority, housing and tenant sectors.

2. Today's consultation, _Giving Tenants Control: Right to Transfer and Right to Manage Regulations_, introduces new regulations on Right to Transfer and proposes streamlining the existing Right to Manage regulations. Details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/transfermanageconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/transfermanageconsult).

3. Right to Transfer Regulations would put a duty on local authorities to co-operate with tenant groups in following a process for exploring transfer options, and if, after this exploration there is evidence of support for a transfer, to consult all the affected tenants.

4. By following the procedures set out in Right to Manage Regulations, a tenant management organisation can enter into an agreement with their local housing authority to take over responsibility for managing local services.

5. _Giving Tenants Control: Right to Transfer and Right to Manage Regulations - Consultation_ proposes streamlining these regulations so that it is easier for tenant management organisations to take over responsibility for delivering local services from their local authority landlord.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1705785,HIPs failed because no one trusted them,"Home Information Packs were not trusted and it was right to scrap them, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has said.

HIPs were suspended by the new Government within days to provide certainty to the property market, and help it during the recovery by reducing the cost of selling a home.

### Lack of trust

Now independent research shows home buyers were 'very concerned' about the reliability of information they were receiving in HIPs.

The research by Ipsos Mori found that while over 90 per cent of people buying a house wanted information about its condition, fewer than one in six trusted this information when provided by the seller.

And more experienced buyers preferred to use an informal inspection by a builder, plumber or electrician who they already knew rather than use a condition survey.

Responding to the research, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It was always obvious that HIPs were deeply unpopular with people selling homes because they created needless cost and hassle. What is now clear is that people buying homes didn't rate them either.
> 
> ""People who buy and sell homes want to know more about their condition, but forcing them to swap bits of information they don't want or trust is a foolish way to try and improve the property market.""

### New voluntary system

Mr Shapps said in future it would be the housing sector that develops products that provide consumers with information about a home's condition.

This information will be exchanged between buyers and sellers on a strictly voluntary basis, and will ensure people buying homes only get the information they actually want, and that they know they can trust.

The end of HIPs has already seen a jump in the number of properties being put on the market, and will save consumers an estimated £870m over ten years.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2028421,House hunting heroes in government's sights,"Ahead of Remembrance Sunday, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today set out his plans to ensure that each of our country's service men and women get the housing help they need.

He argued that all too often, the nature of military work can become a ""blockade"" to members of the armed forces meeting their aspirations for a secure and stable home. The Minister made a key pledge to our men and women in uniform to pull out all the stops to give them the support they need - whether buying their first home or applying for social housing.

The package of housing help for heroes includes:

  * Help for first time buyers: Service men and women looking to own their first home will be at the very front of the queue for Government-funded home ownership schemes, including the new FirstBuy scheme - which will prioritise military personnel and their families for up to a year after active service ends.
  * Tailored support: To make sure they know exactly what's on offer, housing experts are visiting military bases across the country to explain to our nation's best how they can apply for one of the thousands of new homes that will be built in the next few years.
  * Moving up the waiting list: Ministers believe that years of loyal service to this country should not become an obstacle to finding a home, yet moving from base-to-base can often leave our troops without strong local connections - something many councils look for when allocating social homes. That's why Mr Shapps has pledged to give councils a duty to put heroes who want a home in their area at the top of the local waiting list.

Finding a home is not the only challenge our heroes can face when returning from active duty.

  * Support for the wounded: Government has increased funding for home adaptations, so that those brave heroes who return from active service with serious injuries can live independently with the dignity and respect that their selfless sacrifice deserves.
  * Access to credit: Government is also working hard to bring relief to those hard-working men and women in uniform whose years serving abroad or living on military bases have left them with no permanent address - which can often make applying for credit or a mortgage almost impossible. Ministers are working closely with credit companies and the Royal Mail to ensure the unique circumstances of military life will no longer be an obstacle.
  * Homelessness support: And for ex-service personnel who find the transition back to civilian life difficult, Ministers across Government are working with Homelessness and veteran experts to find out how we can prevent our brave veterans from facing a life on the streets.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Our brave men and women in uniform aren't looking for sympathy and handouts, but all too often their selfless sacrifice for this country can become a major blockade on the road to a home of their own.
> 
> ""That's why house-hunting heroes on the look-out for their first home will be at the very front of the queue for new Government-funded schemes like Firstbuy. And we're working hard to make sure that our troops know exactly what options are open to them.
> 
> ""Equally, years of loyal military service should not be rewarded with years of languishing on local waiting lists. Just as our brave troops answered their call of duty, councils will need to do the same, to ensure that heroes who want a home in their area will be at the top of local waiting lists.
> 
> ""All these actions mean we're marching double-time toward making sure that those who serve our country get the homes and support they deserve.""

Mr Shapps said it is right that the brave men and women who give their all to protect our country get more assistance to find a decent home to live in - whether they are still serving or returning to life on civvy street.

Invitations were sent to key house builders, councils, lenders, defence officials and services' charities to attend the summit, for a candid and open discussion about all the issues, including:

  * a new commitment to offer priority for service personnel under the Government's FirstBuy scheme
  * tackling the barriers which can disadvantage Service or ex-Service personnel in securing a mortgage, such as difficulty with credit scoring because of service overseas or living on army bases without standard postcodes
  * working with councils to encourage fairer treatment for military personnel applying to live in social housing
  * ensuring national planning rules are flexible enough to allow disabled ex-servicemen to have homes that suit their needs
  * working better across Government and with charities to tackle homelessness amongst ex-service personnel
  * looking at how service personnel could benefit from other initiatives to help first time buyers, including privately funded shared equity schemes that cushion the cost of buying a home
  * exploring what specific actions might be needed to enable more ex-service personnel to bring forward self-build housing projects; and
  * working with the Ministry of Defence to ensure surplus land they release for development can be used for housing that benefits ex-service personnel.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The brave men and women who serve in our military are heroes, who everyday make a commitment that is well beyond just coming to work and doing a job. And yet often they are the very people who struggle to get a roof over their head or fulfil their aspiration of buying their own home.
> 
> ""This is wrong, and we will not stand idly by and deny decent homes to the people who deserve them the most. That's why I'm calling together key figures from across industry and the military to discuss how we can tackle this problem.

> ""This is not about charity - it's about duty, our duty as a nation to serve those who have put their lives on the line for the benefit of the entire country. Members of our armed forces don't want our sympathy or a hand out, just a chance. They have answered the call of duty, and now we must hear their call.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2074845,Housing partnership will give new insight into how the market ticks,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today hailed a new partnership between the Government and the National House Building Council (NHBC) to gain a greater insight into how efforts to get Britain building again are making a difference in communities across the country.

In an innovative new deal between the Government and NHBC, Ministers will have access to a wealth of information on the ins and outs of housebuilding - from details of the materials used to build a home, to insights on the journey from the start of the construction process through to the final sale.

NHBC provides warranties for over 80 per cent of the UK's new-build homes. Mr Shapps said that by extending the scope of information they provide, the Government will be able to drill down into the fine detail of the house-building process and understand how government can help to enable the delivery of the homes the country needs.

The Government has already taken strong action to help unblock the property pipeline. The £400 million Get Britain Building Fund will restart stalled developments while the Mortgage Indemnity Scheme helps first time buyers find the funds they need to buy newly built homes.

But by sharing the insights of these housing market experts, Mr Shapps believes many more stumbling blocks could be overcome.

Information that could be shared by NHBC includes:

  * house-building activity levels
  * information on where projects have stalled and why
  * building quality and design
  * sustainability of new housing
  * speed of build
  * insights into the possible effects of proposed policies
  * historical data comparisons.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""As we look to get Britain building again, we've taken decisive action to bring down the barriers to building with help to get stalled projects back on track, incentives for councils to build and extra support for first-time buyers.
> 
> ""But there's always more to be done and that's why I'm asking the experts to help us know exactly how the market ticks. NHBC have long worked closely with Government to ensure our numbers are as accurate as possible. I know that today's new partnership will broaden and deepen both our understandings of cause and effect in the housing market and bring new ideas and insights to the fore.""

Imtiaz Farookhi, Chief Executive of NHBC said:

> ""NHBC works closely with the Government to support the delivery of high quality sustainable new homes for homeowners across the country.
> 
> ""We are delighted to agree this new partnership to provide a vast range of detailed information.
> 
> ""High quality data plays such an important role helping the Government to assess the progress of its housing programme. Our partnership will support this and help deliver more quality new homes that the country desperately needs.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2032826,Housing rules should not be a barrier to a stable home life,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on councils to give the dreams and aspirations of prospective adoptive parents and foster carers a helping hand, and cut through red tape hindering adoptions and fostering.

Forthcoming guidance will make clear that councils will be expected to consider how their actions could help people in their area who are looking to adopt or foster a child in need of a stable, loving family.

Currently there is a Catch-22 situation that is blighting prospective parents' and carers' efforts to adopt or foster: legislation rightly requires adopted and fostered children to have their own bedroom but currently it is often difficult for prospective adoptive parents and foster carers to obtain a larger council house before their application to adopt or foster can be approved.

Mr Shapps said this new forthcoming guidance on allocating council homes would break down the barriers between different council departments and ensure that the needs of children waiting for adoption will be considered and the needs of those wanting to adopt or foster can be met.

Whilst councils will continue to allocate on the basis of need, these new recommendations call for the needs of those people looking to adopt or foster to be considered.

The Minister argued that the need for good foster homes and the wider social benefits of bringing children out of care and into a stable and loving home are too important for them to be frustrated by council departments working in isolation. These measures will call for children's services and housing departments to work closer together to do their utmost to help.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It is a tragedy that we live in a society where bureaucracy and red tape can prevent children from being adopted or fostered into a stable home. I want the dreams of prospective foster carers and adoptive parents and the dreams of children in care to be realised.
> 
> ""I want councils to be creative with the powers and flexibilities we have given them: if a family is willing to take the brave step of adopting or fostering a child, we should aim for a housing system that supports them rather than getting in the way. The wider social benefits of bringing children out of care and into a stable and loving home are too great for them to be stymied by council departments working in silos.
> 
> ""I will also be looking at any way, we, in Whitehall can make the process smoother for prospective foster carers and adoptive parents. Over the next few months we will be undertaking a wider trawl of housing and local government red tape and looking to amend anything that might be preventing people from coming forward to foster or adopt a child.""

Children's Minister Tim Loughton added:

> ""We urgently need more people to come forward to adopt and foster children. We must make sure that when people do come forward, local authorities are doing everything they can to make the process easier. Issues around the number of bedrooms in a home should not be preventing children from finding safe, loving placements with families.
> 
> ""We want to see more local authorities using their common sense on these issues. New housing guidance is a welcome step forward, and will give local authorities more flexibility in how they handle housing applications for prospective adopters and foster carers.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2079093,Housing takes centre stage in economic recovery plans,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today highlighted how the Government's action to get Britain building again will play a vital and central role in getting the country's economy on the road to recovery.

Six weeks before the budget - and less than three months since the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister launched the Government's flagship Housing Strategy - Mr Shapps unveiled a range of measures to help first time buyers onto the housing ladder, provide support for millions who have been left languishing on social housing waiting lists and get construction on the move.

In a speech to councils and the housing sector, the Minister argued that in contrast to the experiences of the past, where a plethora of housing policies, papers and initiatives ""gathered dust on Whitehall shelves"", the determination of the Prime Minister and the Government to put housing centre stage has meant that tangible progress is already being made - with plenty more moves on the way.

Among the range of measures to get the homes the country needs built, the Minister today announced:

  * That he has already identified enough Government land to build 80,000 homes, and is now working with organisations including the BBC and Royal Mail to find even more unused sites for housebuilding - meaning Ministers are on course to release enough land for 100,000 homes by 2015
  * Details of the NewBuy Guarantee scheme to help those aspiring to buy newly-built properties to do so with just a fraction of the deposit that's normally required; and
  * That he is devolving power from Whitehall to Town Halls, ending a long-standing ""tax on tenants"" in a £19 billion deal enabling councils to keep the rents they collect and invest the money in their homes.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The pattern of the past has been to produce endless policies and initiatives that simply gather dust on Whitehall shelves and lead to inaction and inertia. But with the Prime Minister putting housing centre stage on the road to economic recovery, I am determined that we shall not repeat these mistakes of the past.
> 
> ""That's why I'm pulling out all the stops for those who want to get on the property ladder, so from March the NewBuy Guarantee scheme will be on hand to help people buying newly built properties with just a fraction of the deposit they would normally need.
> 
> ""It's also why I am working across Whitehall to ensure we release enough public land for 100,000 new homes by 2015. But I'm looking beyond Westminster and want to see organisations like the BBC, Royal Mail and Network Rail also follow our lead.
> 
> ""And for those languishing on council waiting lists, my message is clear: we are doing all we can to bring your wait to an end. That's why today I'm laying the final foundations for a £19 billion deal that will end the 'tenants tax' and give councils the freedom they need to build more homes in their area.""

#### Help onto the Housing Ladder

The Minister made clear his commitment to ""go the extra mile"" for those aspiring to get on the housing ladder. In March 2012, he plans to launch the NewBuy Guarantee scheme, which brings lenders, builders and Government together to offer mortgages on new-build properties with a fraction of the deposit currently required - so while buyers may typically require £40,000 towards a new home, under this new scheme a £10,000 deposit will get them into a new-build property of their own.

And today, Grant Shapps confirmed that the scheme would be open to UK citizens buying on new build houses and flats up to £500,000 as their main home - whether they are first time buyers or moving up the ladder.

#### Getting Britain Building

Mr Shapps also confirmed that he is working with nine Government departments and organisations including the BBC, Network Rail and the Royal Mail to identify unused land and buildings that could be released for house-building - supporting his key priority to build the homes this country needs.

He hailed the rapid progress that has already been made, with enough Government land already identified to release for over 80,000 new homes - putting plans easily on course to release enough land for 100,000 homes by 2015.

To help with this, the Ministry of Justice, HM Treasury, the Home Office, the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will also look at their land holdings.

To unlock sites for housebuilding blighted by poor infrastructure, Mr Shapps announced the allocation of the £500 million Growing Places Fund - launched just three months ago - to 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships across the country, helping to create thousands of jobs in construction and related industries.

This is on top of the £432 million in cash bonuses that the Minister today confirmed for 353 councils that have built new homes or have brought back into use empty properties - including a £21 million premium for new affordable homes.

Today's cash boost is the second instalment of the New Homes Bonus, in recognition of communities delivering 159,000 much-needed homes in their local area.

The Minister also confirmed that he will allocate £45 million funding to help unlock 18 of the most difficult stalled sites in the country to get workers back on site and 1,301 homes built whilst delivering positive regeneration benefits to those locations.

The funding forms part of the £420 million Get Britain Building fund. Launched less than two months ago, this multi-million pound cash injection is expected to unlock up to 16,000 homes on sites that are currently stalled, and help create up to 30,000 jobs in construction and related industries.

#### Ending the tax on tenants

Mr Shapps also announced details for ""ending the tax on tenants"", finalising a groundbreaking £19 billion deal that will release councils from a centralised social rent system.

The Minister said that for years, councils have been captives of a centralised system, surrendering their social rents to the Government to decide how best to redistribute it. This meant that the majority of councils lost millions in social rent - in some cases over half of what they collected.

Mr Shapps today confirmed that councils will finally be allowed to keep the rents they collect, giving them an average 15 per cent more to spend on managing and maintaining their homes.

#### Strengthening protection for leaseholders

The Minister also confirmed proposals to bring ""outdated"" protections for leaseholders back in line with changing property prices.

Mr Shapps proposes to raise the £25,000 ""value limit"" - or notional annual rental value - outpaced by house price inflation since it was set in 1990 - to £100,000, enabling many leaseholders to stay in their home when their lease comes to an end.

These are rights to remain in their properties at the end of their lease terms as an ""assured  tenant"" (in Schedule 10 to the Local Government and Housing Act 1989) and to extend the lease or purchase the freehold of their leasehold house on particular terms (in the Leasehold Reform Act 1967). Legislative change would be subject to Parliamentary approval. The Summary of Responses, including proposed next steps, is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/housing/homeownership/leasehold/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/homeownership/leasehold/).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2110102,Invest to save' and offer support to vulnerable people,"Councils must 'invest to save' and protect their most disadvantaged residents, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The Minister urged town halls to follow Whitehall's example and protect Supporting People funding to help the most vulnerable in their communities.

In a letter to council leaders, he reminded councils as they set their budgets they should consider evidence showing that every pound spent through this housing support services saves £3 - in reduced costs in homelessness, tenancy failure, crime, health and residential care packages.

So the £1.6 billion invested annually in Supporting People can save as much as £3.41 billion in the costs of alternative help for vulnerable people in our communities.

#### Funding protected

The Government protected £6.5 billion funding for Supporting People over the course of the Spending Review - representing a less than one per cent cash reduction in funding each year.

The funding helps people across the country to live independently in their own homes.

These can include:

  * older and disabled people
  * single homeless people
  * people with mental health problems; and
  * women at risk of domestic violence.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Local taxpayers will rightly expect their councils to do their utmost to protect the services that help the most vulnerable residents in their communities - and so do I.
> 
> ""That's why, despite the need to cut the record deficit we inherited, we've protected the £6.5 billion Supporting People funding which each year helps approximately a million people to live independent lives.
> 
> ""As councils look to set their budgets, I would urge them to consider the evidence that with each pound spent through Supporting People saving £3 by avoiding more costly alternatives, and invest to save to ensure help continues for those most in need.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1705813,Lack of trust condemned HIPs to failure,"Independent research proves that Home Information Packs were ignored by the very people they were meant to help, backing the decision to scrap them, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The new Government scrapped HIPs within days to provide certainty to the property market, and help it during the recovery by reducing the cost of selling a home. The end of HIPs has already seen a jump in the number of properties being put on the market, and will save consumers an estimated £870m over ten years.

The research, published today, by Ipsos Mori found that while over 90 per cent of people buying a house want information about its condition, fewer than one in six trust this information when it is provided by the seller.

Home buyers were 'very concerned' about the reliability of information they received from sellers, and over 75 per cent claimed they would only trust information from an independent surveyor that they had appointed. More experienced buyers preferred to use an informal inspection by a builder, plumber or electrician who they already knew rather than use a condition survey.

Mr Shapps said the research, which was commissioned by Communities and Local Government last year, showed that adding extra layers of regulation to improve the property market does not work.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It was always obvious that HIPs were deeply unpopular with people selling homes because they created needless cost and hassle. What is now clear is that people buying homes didn't rate them either.
> 
> ""People who buy and sell homes want to know more about their condition, but forcing them to swap bits of information they don't want or trust is a foolish way to try and improve the property market.
> 
> ""That's why in future this information will be provided on a strictly voluntary basis. We will allow the housing sector to develop products that include the information consumers actually want, and that they can rely on when buying a home.""

### Notes to editors

1. In 2008 the Government established the Working Group, involving industry professionals (RICS, SAVA, Which?, CML, BSA and the Law Society) to look at the issues around consumer demand for condition information.

2. To assist in developing an evidence base for the Working Group, Ipsos MORI was commissioned to conduct a research exercise, which looked at the role of condition information in the home buying and selling process. The field work included views from consumers and property professionals using in depth interviews, focus groups and online surveys, and was carried out in June 2009. A copy of the research and a separate report by the Working Group can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/finalconditionreport](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/finalconditionreport).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2045589,Landlords must catch up and open their books to public scrutiny,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today criticised those housing associations that have failed to publish more widely details of how they are spending public money for their tenants to see.

In a letter to the National Housing Federation, Mr Shapps has argued that since coming to office he has repeatedly called on them to follow the Government's lead and come up with their own plans for opening up the Housing Association sector to more public scrutiny - yet in all that time little progress has been made.

The Minister called on landlords to ""throw open their books to the public"" and let taxpayers and tenants see how much is being spent to manage their homes.

He said housing associations should follow in the footsteps of The Home Group, who have voluntarily published details of all their spending over £500.

He warned that ""time is running out"" on those who keep their books firmly closed because the Government has indicated that it will shortly consult on whether housing associations should be covered by the Freedom of Information Act.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""After 18 months of asking, housing associations have still failed to follow our lead and open themselves up to wider public scrutiny. Taxpayers and tenants have a right to know how much they spend, from repairs, to rents and expenses.
> 
> ""Greater transparency is not an added extra but a vital means of cutting costs and ensuring efficiency by helping every pound work harder. So today I'm sending out a clear message. Housing associations are running out of time to come up with plans that will dramatically transform transparency throwing open their books and publishing details of what they spend.
> 
> ""With Whitehall taking the lead, and Town Halls following suit, these landlords are increasingly looking outdated and out of touch. And with our plans to consult on the potential extension of the Freedom of Information Act to housing associations, the clock is ticking for those landlords who keep their books stubbornly closed.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1722694,Landlords should throw open their books to improve social homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has called on the country's housing associations to follow the Government's lead, throw open their books and expose how they spend money to public scrutiny.

Mr Shapps said it is not enough for the Government to put its house in order - everyone who receives public money must do the same.

With public subsidies being reduced, housing associations will need to change so they can do more for less, and continue to meet the needs of the communities they serve. The Minister said all organisations that manage and build social housing should open their books and publish their expenditure, so tenants can see how their money is being spent, and the wider public can see they are getting value for money.

The Department for Communities and Local Government was the first to publish details of all spending over £500 - and Mr Shapps encouraged housing associations to do the same as the start of a new 'spirit of openness'.

The Minister added that social housing tenants will demand to know if the people who provide the homes they live in are earning more than the Prime Minister. Anyone who relies on taxpayers' money to provide a public service will need to prove that they are providing the best possible service with the money available.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Housing associations have proved themselves to be experts at steering massive private investment towards social homes - without them the housing shortage in this country would be even more acute. But over recent years large amounts of public money has been invested and I want to know we can get the most out of this past, present and future public investment.
> 
> ""We're now in a new era of public spending - there will no return to the old way of doing things, and no one can afford to rest on their laurels. So I'm calling on organisations that deliver and manage social housing to throw open their books and show the people they serve where the money is going.
> 
> ""This isn't a gesture; we need to squeeze the most out of every pound spent. Where there are opportunities for greater efficiency the public will see these - and they will demand they are taken.""

He added:

> ""They want to know how many people think that their job is tougher than being Prime Minister.
> 
> ""And I want to know how it can be justified to pay enormous salaries which are ultimately being paid for either through the hard work and toil of taxpayers - or worse, from the rents of tenants who maybe the people in society least able to afford your salary.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1743510,Localism will drive up standards in social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today set out how a new era of regulating social housing at the local level will deliver better homes for tenants, whilst at the same time ensuring lenders continue to invest in the sector.

Following the announcement last week that the Tenant Services Authority (TSA) would be abolished, a comprehensive report published today explains how stronger powers for tenants will drive up the quality of their homes. Tenants can now expect local solutions to local problems - they will be able to set up local panels and call on their councillors and MPs to hold landlords to account to help resolve disputes.

The report, which follows a wide-ranging review of the TSA commissioned by Mr Shapps in June, also sets out how a new independent committee within the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) will continue the economic regulation of social housing. The committee will make sure public spending on social housing is delivering value for money and lender confidence is maintained, ensuring that housing providers continue to secure significant private investment for affordable housing.

Mr Shapps said that following the abolition of the TSA, consumer protection and economic regulation of the sector would need different levels and styles of regulation, not a cumbersome bureaucratic approach directed from central Government.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Social tenants know when things are going wrong with homes in their area. And when this happens, they want to be able to fix the problems quickly and easily, not sit around waiting for a remote inspection regime run from Whitehall.
> 
> ""That's why we're changing how this is done. Consumer protection is going local - tenants will now be able to hold landlords to account with the help of their local representatives, and though panels that they set up and control themselves.
> 
> ""At the same time the vital economic regulation of the sector as a whole will continue. The new regulator will be able to focus its energies on ensuring that taxpayers' money spent on social housing goes further, and give lenders the confidence they need to invest funds in building more social homes.""

In future locally elected representatives will have a much stronger role in regulation. Where tenants are unhappy with the way a complaint has been handled by their landlord, MPs, councillors and tenant panels will be able to scrutinise the performance of landlords, and help tenants secure better services.

Landlords will need to make a wide variety of information that tenants can use to assess their performance readily available. They will also be expected to work with tenants to set up systems, such as tenant panels, where their performance can be scrutinised and disputes resolved. If these local systems don't resolve the issue there will be the option to refer the complaint to an ombudsman.

The current economic regulation of the sector will be transferred to the HCA, but to ensure there is sufficient separation between the regulation of social housing and investment decisions, an independent Regulation Committee will be set up within the HCA with its membership appointed by the Secretary of State.

The committee will have a greater focus on ensuring value for money and driving efficiency in the sector - vital activities in the current economic climate to squeeze as much value as possible out of every taxpayer's pound. The role of the committee on consumer regulation will be limited to setting overarching standards of service for landlords and addressing serious failures where local measures have not a provided a solution.

### Notes for editors

1. The Tenant Services Authority (TSA) was created by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 and is the regulator for nearly 1,800 social housing landlords, including housing associations, councils and co-operatives in England. On 1 April 2010, the TSA commenced regulation with its new powers and based on a common set of standards applicable to social housing landlords.

2. The TSA cost £40m in its first year of operations, and its budget for 2010-11 is approximately £33 million.

3. In June 2010 Grant Shapps MP announced a review of the role and purpose of the Tenant Services Authority (TSA) and the framework for social housing regulation. A report of the review can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulation).

4. The review was set in the context of the following published Government objectives:

  * reducing the number and cost of quangos

  * reducing administration costs and ensuring value for money of public investment

  * cutting unnecessary regulation and inspection

  * ensuring there is a robust, transparent and independent framework of economic regulation for social housing

  * ensuring there is a regulatory environment that ensures housing associations continue to command the confidence of lenders and can continue to attract investment at competitive rates

  * supporting a supply of affordable housing

  * ensuring social housing tenants are adequately protected and empowered.

5. Summary of review findings:

  * The Tenant Services Authority (TSA) should be abolished and its economic regulation and backstop consumer regulation functions transferred to the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), generating efficiency savings in back-office functions and exploiting synergies across investment and regulation.
  * In order to ensure the continued independence of regulation, these functions should be vested in a statutory committee within the HCA, legally separated from HCA's investment functions and with its membership appointed by the Secretary of State.
  * The role of consumer regulation should be refocused on setting clear service standards for social landlords and addressing serious failures against those standards, with a higher legal threshold for regulatory intervention.
  * Greater onus should be placed on local mechanisms to address routine problems and to enable tenants to hold their landlord to account and press for better services. There should be a clearer role in the complaints process for locally elected representatives and tenant panels in advocating for tenants.
  * In order to maintain lender confidence and protect taxpayers, proactive economic regulation of housing associations should continue as now but with more focus on value for money for the taxpayer. 

6. To facilitate setting up local tenant panels, the Government will discuss with the four National Tenant Organisations (NTOs) ideas for:

  * developing a framework, which is owned by the tenant sector, and sets out what an effective tenant panel might look like. This would provide assurance about the credibility of the Panel and would be key to landlords recognising local panels;
  * training and support to help tenants fulfil their role on the tenant panel.

This will be underpinned with a Direction to the regulator to ensure that, as part of a revised Tenant Involvement and Empowerment Standard, landlords will be expected to provide a range of opportunities to influence and participate in the scrutiny of landlord performance. This will include the formation of tenant panels.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1859713,Manchester to kickstart green homes revolution,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today unveiled the pioneer project that will pave the way for the green transformation of Britain's social homes - making them warmer and more comfortable to live in, and at the same time cheaper to run.

In the largest scheme of this kind to date, improvements such as solid wall insulation and better heating systems will be made to 9,000 social homes in Manchester to make them more energy efficient.

The cost of the work will be paid upfront by the housing association - tenants will then meet this cost through the money they save on energy bills, which could be up to £500 per year. The project could create more than 1,800 jobs and bring a £100 million boost to local businesses carrying out the home improvements.

The project will test key features of the Green Deal - the Government's new and radical way of making energy efficiency available to all, whether people that own or rent their property. Under the Green Deal, which will begin next year, the expected cash savings for homeowners and tenants will be greater than the costs to upgrade the property over the lifetime of the improvements.

Upgrades will initially be made to 2,500 properties within the Greater Manchester Housing Retrofit Programme, and will prepare the way for Greater Manchester's 260,000 social homes to take up the Green Deal.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""With homes counting for a quarter of all UK emissions, we must and can do more to make our homes greener. That's why we're nailing down a zero carbon approach so tough new green standards can come into effect from 2016.
> 
> ""But we also want to upgrade existing housing stock so everyone can enjoy the benefits of warmer homes and lower energy bills. That's why I'm delighted to announce for the first time, a large scale project to upgrade thousands of social homes.
> 
> ""The scheme in Manchester will save tenants hundreds of pounds on energy bills, and create hundreds of jobs for local people. It shows that going green is not just an environmental necessity; it's also a huge economic opportunity for UK companies to expand their businesses, and become world leaders in the shift to a low carbon economy.""

Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne said:

> ""Tenants in Manchester are getting an advance preview of key elements of the Green Deal: they're going to feel the real benefit of warmer and comfier homes at the same time as cutting their energy bills.
> 
> ""I want the Green Deal to work for everyone - whether people own or rent their home. In twenty first century Britain, no one should have to put up with draughty and cold homes.""

Cllr Dave Goddard Chair of the Greater Manchester Environment Commission said:

> ""This is a great opportunity to use the expertise and scale of the social housing sector in Greater Manchester to test implementation of the Government's Green Deal. This will strengthen our work with businesses to develop the skills and jobs to deliver home energy improvements to all our homes, particularly those which are very expensive to heat.
> 
> ""We have strong partnerships in place across Greater Manchester and we are determined to drive the low carbon economy, to constantly build up the social, environmental and economic benefits for all our communities""

Manchester's pioneering scheme will provide a valuable model for upgrading the country's 3.8 million households in the social rented sector, which account for nearly 20 per cent of all households in England. Social landlords will bear the upfront costs - tenants will then pay a contribution to the costs through their rents, but will save money overall through lower fuel bills.

The retrofit project will act as a beacon for both investors and other social housing providers in demonstrating the vast potential for Green Deal investment in that sector.

By 2015 up to 100,000 Green Deal workers could be employed nationally in the effort to upgrade Britain's homes. Currently around 27,000 work in the insulation industry. Legislation to start the process of establishing the Green Deal is currently before Parliament. Improving the energy efficiency of homes will also make a large contribution to reducing carbon emissions - homes count for around a quarter of all UK emissions and the majority of people waste money through energy bills.

### Notes to editors

1. Ministers have announced a pioneering retrofit project with the Greater Manchester Housing Retrofit Programme, which will provide a model for investors and other social housing providers in demonstrating the vast potential for Green Deal investment in that sector.

2. Initially Salix Homes, as part of the Greater Manchester Housing Retrofit Programme, will develop the initiative as part of its current investment programme. The scheme will then be rolled out to up to 9,000 under the retrofit programme, which will prepare the way for Greater Manchester's 260,000 social homes to take up the Green Deal.

3. The scheme will provide valuable lessons for:

  * supporting local government and social housing providers in considering the potential of Green Deal as significant investment opportunity

  * increasing understanding of the development time and preparation needed to attract investment

  * developing the supply chain to deliver harder measures such as solid wall insulation, and prime the market to provide the coordinated installation services which will be necessary under Green Deal.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1845062,More help on the way for first time buyers,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on key players in the housing industry to work more closely together to help aspiring first time buyers get a foot on the property ladder.

Leading industry figures representing house builders, lenders, insurers, councils and consumer groups attended a summit today held by Mr Shapps, to discuss how they could step up their efforts to help young people who aspire to own their own home.

Ministers called the meeting so there could be a frank and open discussion about all the issues. Practical work that will now be taken forward includes:

  * working with homebuilders and lenders to understand the current barriers to the availability of mortgages, and encouraging them to devise new mortgage products that address the challenges faced by first time buyers - such as innovative schemes for parents to support their children into home ownership - for example, the Lloyds Lend a Hand scheme or the Hitachi loan deal, or the new mortgage guarantee scheme launched today by Taylor Wimpey
  * increasing new and creative local approaches to shared ownership or equity loans - there are a number of providers looking to expand or facilitate the expansion of the shared ownership or equity loan provision; and
  * exploring the barriers to the take-up of mortgage insurance, and looking at the role of mortgage indemnity guarantees for increasing lending to first time buyers.

A key issue to emerge from the meeting is that there is a communication problem between different sectors of the housing industry. Mr Shapps said better communication within the housing industry, including building on the work of the Home Finance Forum, would be vital to helping first time buyers.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I called on key figures from across industry to come together today, because we must do more to help aspiring first time buyers - the average age of the first time buyer with no support from their family is now 37, and there are 1.4 million households who aspire to own a home but are simply unable to do so because of house prices and mortgage availability.
> 
> ""I wanted to hear a first hand account of the problems the sector faces, but I also wanted to knock heads together so the needs of young people who want to buy a home are put first. The Government is working with industry to improve the availability of mortgages - but there also needs to be a much more unified effort from across the board to work together, so we can ensure that young people are not locked out of the housing market.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2016097,Nationwide home swaps become 'just a click away',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today launched a new national scheme that, for the first time, will allow social housing tenants wanting to swap their home to see every available property in the country.

'_HomeSwap_ Direct' will give tenants who want to move house - to be closer to a new job, their family, or to a property better suited to their needs - greater choice over potential swaps by allowing them to see a much wider selection of properties than ever before.

Until now tenants have been restricted to swapping properties with other tenants in the scheme chosen by their landlord - effectively meaning only a partial swap scheme existed. '_HomeSwap_ Direct' will instead give tenants access to properties nationwide and boost their prospects of moving.

And as the scheme will be online, it will make advertised swaps much more accessible for tenants and the possibility of moving house 'just a click away'.

Ministers believe that the current system has left tenants facing an uphill battle when they want to swap to a new home further than just down the road, and have often reverted to applying for a transfer to a new or empty property - where they end up pitting themselves against the record numbers of families on social housing waiting lists.

Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the home swap system is expected to not only bring economic benefit for tenants and their families by putting them in a position to take up more opportunities, but could also help provide overcrowded families with new opportunities to move into a larger home, swapping with other tenants whose children have moved on and now need a smaller property easier to heat and maintain.

So from next April, new requirements will mean that all social housing landlords will have to ensure that they make properties from across the UK available to their tenants looking to swap their home, giving them the opportunity to move anywhere in the UK - including Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

The reforms are part of the measures included in the Localism Bill to give social tenants far greater freedoms and flexibilities and make better use of social housing.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's crazy that some people don't want council tenants to have the same life opportunities as everyone else. At the moment tenants who live in social homes might be able to move nearby, but there's almost no chance of a longer-distance move to take up a new job offer or move closer to their family.
> 
> ""I'm not content to restrict opportunities for the eight million social tenants in this country - that's why we are determined to shake up the lazy consensus that traps people in this system. _HomeSwap_ Direct will give tenants access to a wider range of properties than ever before, and the chance to move anywhere in the country.
> 
> ""Instead of confining people wanting to move to the back of the queue, it will put their future in their hands, giving them the power to arrange their own home swaps and make the most of every opportunity.""

Scotland's Housing and Transport Minister Keith Brown, said:

> ""I welcome the launch of the _HomeSwap_ Direct.  
   
""The scheme will give tenants in Scotland more choice and options by making it easier for them to see details of mutual exchange matches with information on all potential swap partners, throughout the UK.
> 
> ""Two of the providers presently operate in Scotland and have confirmed that any Scottish tenants using their sites will be able to benefit from the national scheme immediately and will have the same experience as tenants in all parts of the UK.""

Michelle Reid, CEO of the Tenant Participation Advisory Service (TPAS), and Michael Gelling, Chairperson of the Tenants' and Residents' Organisation of England (TAROE) said:

> ""We know many of our tenant members welcome the launch of _HomeSwap_ Direct, as it will make it much easier for them to move to a social home that better suits their needs. For a long time, our tenant members have been asking for it to be made easier for them to move around the country and this scheme will now allow them to do that.""

Martha Lane Fox, the UK's Digital Champion, said:

> ""_HomeSwap_ Direct is a great example of how digital services can benefit tenants and landlords. Inspiring and supporting tenants to go online and access digital services will increase not only the choice and control they can exercise over where they live, but also their opportunities for education, employment and wellbeing.""

Wales Housing, Regeneration and Heritage Minister Huw Lewis said:

> ""_HomeSwap_ Direct will offer tenants more choice on where they live, improving their chances of finding homes to meet their needs.
> 
> ""I would encourage all landlords who are not already subscribing to a mutual exchange service that participates in this service to consider doing so to ensure that all Welsh tenants can share in its benefits.""

### Notes to editors

  * _HomeSwap_ Direct brings together four internet-based providers of mutual exchange services (HomeSwapper, House Exchange, Abritas and LHS (Locata)) to offer tenants more choice over where they live.
  * A membership agreement which has been developed by Government and joined by these providers is at the annex and will be published on their websites. This sets out the framework under which information will be shared by providers, the technical requirements of the scheme and the processes by which new members can apply to join.
  * Proposed new regulations on mutual exchange were included in the consultation _Implementing social housing reform: directions to the social housing regulator_ which closed on 29 September.The proposed direction would require social landlords to ensure their tenants have free access to web-based home-swap services and to subscribe to providers who are part of the national scheme. Final directions to the Regulator will be published later in the autumn.
  * In addition, up to £1 million will be provided to 12 local authority led Mobility demonstration projects who will be testing innovative and cost-effective ways of supporting mobility. Projects include exploring the savings to landlords of tenants moving through mutual exchange rather than a transfer; exploring whether greater mobility can reduce health and social care costs; and investigating the types of support - such as helplines, or dedicated staff - which can best help tenants through the process of moving. 
  * The participating landlords are:

> Bracknell Forest
> 
> Devon
> 
> Doncaster
> 
> Herts Choice Homes
> 
> Kent Homechoice
> 
> Kettering
> 
> Leeds
> 
> Northampton
> 
> Northumberland
> 
> Salford
> 
> West London Housing Partnership
> 
> Worcestershire and Stratford

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1814083,Neighbours from hell face swifter eviction,"Neighbours from hell who cause misery and fear for their fellow tenants could face swifter eviction, under radical plans outlined today by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

He announced a package of measures and Government cash towards tackling anti-social behaviour, giving greater support to tenants and landlords.

Currently it can take over a year to remove neighbours from hell, who during that time can cause absolute misery for local residents and bring down the wider neighbourhood.

But Mr Shapps today announced that he plans to strengthen the hand of residents, councils and housing associations to act. So he will introduce a new additional mandatory ground for possession, so those tenants with a track record of anti-social behaviour can be evicted from their council or housing association property much more quickly.

Ministers believe this will lead to a faster and fairer courts process - being found guilty of housing related anti-social behaviour in one court will provide automatic grounds for eviction in the county court, removing the need to prove the incidents of anti-social behaviour for a second time.

To further speed up the courts process, Mr Shapps announced that he would be exploring jointly with the Justice Department whether there were any unnecessary obstacles to the swift resolution of ASB possession cases where serious harm is being caused to individuals and communities.

Mr Shapps has also announced that he will dedicate £300,000 of Government funding to a new central team to help tenants and landlords tackle the blight of neighbours from hell in their communities.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For too long, too many social tenants have lived in fear of neighbours from hell, whose nasty and vicious behaviour blights their neighbourhoods. Victims and witnesses often have to continue living side by side with the perpetrators while action to evict them drags on for many months and sometimes years.
> 
> ""That's why I want to give hope to these victims that this can and will be stopped. So I will introduce a new mandatory ground for possession, so any tenant convicted of serious anti-social behaviour can be evicted much more quickly. And I'm giving landlords and residents the support they need to reclaim their streets and make their houses feel like homes again.
> 
> ""I want any tenant who comes forward to report anti-social behaviour in their area to get the support they need and deserve. And I want landlords to use the full range of powers at their disposal to tackle this menace head-on, so that the disruptive minority of social tenants don't make everyone else's lives a misery.""

Crime Prevention Minister James Brokenshire said:

> ""Anti-social behaviour ruins lives and damages our communities. It is essential those who raise the alarm and ask for help are listened to and their complaints acted upon promptly.
> 
> ""These measures announced today will give greater powers to social landlords and residents to take a firm stand against the bullies and the troublemakers who commit persistent anti-social behaviour and help protect some of the most vulnerable victims from sometimes daily abuse.""

Mr Shapps will also clarify the rules around the use of 'probationary tenancies', which are normally offered to new tenants for up to a year. The Minister will look to reassure housing associations that they have the same freedoms as council landlords to provide longer 'probationary' tenancies. That will mean all social landlords can be confident that they can extend these less secure tenancies for new tenants by up to six months, giving them the extra time they may need to be certain that these new residents treat their home, and their neighbours, with respect.

The Government is also reviewing the anti-social behaviour tool and powers available to the police, councils and social landlords and will publish a consultation on proposed changes shortly.

Action already taken includes launching a new trial in eight police force areas for handling complaints of anti-social behaviour, which will help to quickly identify and protect the most vulnerable victims. The Government has also appointed Baroness Newlove as Champion for Active, Safer Communities to help drive up confidence in our communities.

### Notes to editors

1. Examples of residents who've stood up to their neighbours from hell include:

  * Tina Tomlinson from Sheffield, who faced months of anti-social behaviour from her neighbour. Almost immediately after moving in August 2009, the neighbour regularly made threats to kill Tina, and attempted to force her way into Tina's flat. Sheffield Homes obtained an ex-parte injunction, but this did not stop the abuse - noise monitoring equipment installed in Tina's flat recorded over 37 hours of threats. In January this year, police and environmental protection officers visited the flats, where they were sworn at and the neighbour threatened to ""knife"" Tina. Sheffield Homes resorted to adding additional security and providing wardens to escort Tina into her home safely. The neighbour was sentenced to 90 days in prison, during which Sheffield Homes obtained a possession order, and she was finally evicted in May this year.
  * Dorothy Stenhouse is in her early eighties, and from Derby. Her next-door neighbour regularly had noisy arguments and fights with his carer, causing Mrs Stenhouse sleepless nights and distress. The neighbour and his carer were also responsible for defacing many garden plants and displays, upsetting other residents. But Mrs Stenhouse also suffered at the hands of her downstairs neighbour, who after being asked to turn down his music, reacted violently and repeatedly smashed her hand between his door and door frame. Mrs Stenhouse's landlord, Derby Homes, has taken legal action against all three perpetrators, and their efforts to reclaim the properties has been strengthened by Mrs Stenhouse spending a whole day giving evidence in court against her neighbours.

2. We are also announcing today that ownership of the Respect Standard setting out best practice on preventing and tackling ASB is being transferred from DCLG to the housing sector. The Chartered Institute of Housing, working closely with the Social Landlords Crime and Nuisance Group and other key partners will lead on an early review of the Standard's content, name and any 'sign-up' arrangements.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2100940,New £5 million 'payment by results' deal to get rough sleepers off London's streets,"An innovative new 'payment by results' scheme to help London's persistent rough sleepers off the streets and into secure homes was launched today by Housing Minister Grant Shapps and London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Building on the progress made by the Mayor's London Delivery Board and the capital's charities in tackling homelessness over the last three years - including a three-quarters reduction in the number of entrenched rough sleepers in the capital - this new funding will be used to deal specifically with persistent rough sleepers half of whom come from overseas and who are often facing multiple challenges including drug, alcohol or mental health problems.

In a 'payment by results' deal known as a Social Impact Bond, each charity will receive a share of this funding - but how much will depend on the success of their new projects.

The criteria they will be measured against include:

  * reducing the proportion of regular rough sleepers returning to London's streets
  * reducing admissions to hospital Accident and Emergency Units; and
  * increasing the number of rough sleepers moved into settled accommodation and employment.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We have made great progress but if we are to have any hope of ending rough sleeping for good we must take a new approach. That involves stopping those without a bed from coming to London in the first place.
> 
> ""But it also means using innovative schemes such as Social Impact Bonds to make sure the best charities are rewarded for success in securing stable homes and jobs. That's why I'm backing those organisations with new ideas for helping persistent rough sleepers with a new £5million payment by results scheme, to ensure that these charities who pull out all the stops are rewarded for their efforts.
> 
> ""I am determined to back those who work tirelessly to get people off the streets and into stable homes and jobs, and whose efforts will bring us ever closer to ending rough sleeping for good.""

London Mayor Boris Johnson said:

> ""In just three years we have made some real strides towards ending rough sleeping in London. We have already helped three-quarters of the capital's most entrenched rough sleepers off the streets and seen a massive reduction in the number of people spending a second night outside. 
> 
> ""However much remains to be done if we want to reach our goal of ending rough sleeping in London this year and we must get out there and help those persistent rough sleepers, often battling with hugely complex addiction and mental health problems, to find a new life off the streets.""

### Notes to editors

1. This new incentive fund, known as a Social Impact Bond, will be administered by the Greater London Authority.  
   
2. The Government has provided a £400million grant for preventing homelessness.  
  
3. The Government is also providing £18.5million for councils to help tackle and prevent rough sleeping among single people, ensuring that nobody is turned away without clear and useful advice when they are most in need.  
  
4. The Government and the Greater London Authority are also working closely with foreign embassies to minimise the problem of foreign nationals sleeping rough, with embassies making it easier for rough sleepers to get the documents they need and providing advice and assistance to their citizens in both the UK and in their home countries.  
  
5. A breakdown of rough sleeping in London by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network, showing that over half of London's homeless are from overseas, can be found at: [www.broadwaylondon.org/CHAIN/Reports/StreettoHomeReports.html](http://www.broadwaylondon.org/CHAIN/Reports/StreettoHomeReports.html) (external link).

6. Social Finance completed a feasibility study for the Greater London Authority and the Department for Communities and Local Government to assess the use of a Social Impact Bond to improve outcomes for a cohort of people who are frequent returners to rough sleeping in London. The study was supported by the Young Foundation who mapped existing rough sleeping services and identified core principles for a new model of individualised support services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1766293,New common sense code to build greener homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today published an improved green rating for new homes that will help deliver the next generation of green properties, which are built to the highest standards of sustainable design, and could reduce future utility bills by up to £2,250 a year in the most energy efficient homes.

The Code for Sustainable Homes was introduced in April 2007 as a standard to improve the overall sustainability of new homes. The Code scores against a star rating system, using one to six stars depending on how the property performs against categories such as energy use, waste, materials and water.

Mr Shapps said the Code has been updated to take into account the tougher new rules for energy efficiency in buildings, and help developers make new homes greener without getting bogged down in unnecessary 'gold plated' design features.

The Code, which has been updated after an extensive consultation with housebuilders and industry experts, will also make it easier for consumers and homeowners who want to grade the standard of their properties.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Over a quarter of the country's carbon emissions come from our homes, and if we're serious about tackling climate change we need to reduce this. So I welcome these changes to the Code that bring it in line with the tough new rules for energy efficiency in the Building Regulations.
> 
> ""We need greener homes, but I also want to make it easier to build the homes this country needs. Good building standards can only be effective if they are easy to understand, and only applied where they are appropriate. That's why the Code has been updated to iron out problems that have arisen over time, and streamlined so building standards can be used in a sensible way that suits the local situation.
> 
> ""It's important house builders meet the standards local communities demand, but I'm determined to simplify the complicated processes they have to go through to achieve this. That's why I've pledged to tackle the 'alphabet soup' of standards and red tape that blight efforts to start new developments, and I will be working with industry to get this done.""

The Code is rated from one to six, one being the entry level - above the level of the standard, mandatory Building Regulations - and six as highest, reflecting outstanding sustainable development.

In the first three years, nearly 8,000 homes have been completed to Code level standards. Ministers believe this figure is too low, partly because the current Code is too complicated and bureaucratic. The updated version will be a first step towards making it is easier for developers to deliver more green homes. The new Code's green rating system has been improved by:

  * **Aligning the Code with the latest developments in building regulations** - it will now take into account, and in some cases go beyond, the tougher new Building Regulations to reduce carbon emissions from buildings. For example, a Code level 4 home will now be 25 per cent above this minimum standard. The new Code will also strongly incentivise the introduction of 'fabric energy efficiency standards', so developers can use building materials and techniques that improve the energy efficiency of new homes.

  * **Streamlining the Code and associated processes** - to ensure that the Code is focused on the issues of greatest significance, instead of including unnecessary standards that duplicate existing regulations or create difficulties for developers. For example, there is now an exemption from the 'lifetime homes' standards for sites where it is too steep to apply, and the mandatory requirement for site waste management plans has been removed since it is required by other regulations.

  * **Resolving problems that have arisen in use of the Code** - for example, clarifying parts of the Code that set standards for reducing the risk of flooding. Clear surface water management standards have now been set, enabling developers to understand exactly what is required.

The new Code will have key role in helping people cut their carbon emissions and lead more sustainable lifestyles. The standards reflect the future goals for zero carbon homes and include measures for reducing energy consumption, minimising and recycling waste, reducing potable water demand, reducing the risk and impact of flooding, reducing carbon intensive travel by providing cycle storage as well as promoting facilities for working at home. It encourages a reduction in energy through the choice of building materials as well as the energy used during the construction.

### Notes to editors

1. The Code is a voluntary standard with flexibility for developers to determine the most cost-effective mix of issues to cover to achieve any particular level, subject to a limited number of mandatory requirements to secure particular Code levels. However, it is also used as a condition by local authorities when they want to set sustainability-based planning conditions on housing developments in their area. However, before setting such a condition, planning guidance (PPS1 Supplementary Guide) currently requires authorities to undertake a full viability assessment setting out the costs to industry, and the benefits. The new Code and technical guide can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeguidesummary2010.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeguidesummary2010)

2. Compared to the current version of the Code, the changes being introduced today could result in an overall net present value benefit to the UK economy of nearly £110m. Full details are available in the Impact Assessment which is also being published today at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeimpactassessment2010.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeimpactassessment2010)

3. A major potential saving for developers has been made by making requirements over rainwater management more sensitive, which was proposed by many developers. This, in conjunction with other measures, could reduce the cost of constructing Code homes by up to £50m, depending on the location.

4. Average savings for householders on utility bills are set out below. In 2010, taking into account feed in tariffs, households built to Code level 6 could save between £1250 for a flat and up to £2250 for a detached house in energy and water bills.

Annual Fuel bill and feed-in tariff revenue relative to a Part L compliant home in 2010  
  
  
  


5. Practical experience of working with the Code is also informing the development of other aspects of sustainability policy. For example the development of surface water management proposals in the current Floods and Water Management Bill.

6. The Government is committed to reduce the burden of regulation, and to reducing duplication. Future plans to review the future role of the Code are currently being considered, alongside a wider rationalisation of housing standards.

7. The rating standards in the Code are assessed against nine categories:

  * Pollution
  * Heath and Wellbeing
  * Management
  * Ecology
  * Energy and CO2 Emissions
  * Water
  * Materials
  * Surface Water Run-off
  * Waste

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2060027,New deal will help older people live at home for longer,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today launched a new deal to help older people to continue living comfortably in their own homes - with particular support for those leaving hospital.

With nearly one in five of the whole population expected to be aged 65 or over by 2020, Ministers are determined to ensure elderly, vulnerable people get the help they need to live independent lives, and can be safe in the knowledge that they won't get ripped off by dodgy dealers and fraudsters.

So Mr Shapps has given £51 million towards Home Improvement Agencies, who will provide help and advice including:

  * housing advice, including help to move to more suitable accommodation if needed
  * handyperson services, including small home repairs, home safety and security adaptations
  * energy efficiency advice; and
  * arranging for adaptations and home repairs to be made, including grab rails, stair-lifts and major work such as ground floor extensions.

These agencies also offer hospital discharge services - ensuring older people leaving hospital care are given the support they need to be able to recuperate in the comfort of their own homes.

For those needing adaptations to their homes, Grant Shapps has also confirmed an additional £20 million for Disabled Facilities Grants - bringing the total to £200 million this year alone.

He has also announced £1.5 million funding for FirstStop, which provides independent advice to older people looking to plan their future housing needs - whether in their own homes, or in care homes. This is in addition to work already underway to look at new and innovative ways in which elderly people can fund their future care needs without having to resort to selling their property.

And to plan for the needs of older households in the future, Mr Shapps has announced plans for councils to consider the needs of their ageing residents in their local housing plans, by planning the numbers of new homes built  to ensure they include features that meet the needs of older people, such as wider doors for wheelchairs and walk-in showers.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""As we get older the last thing we want is for our properties to become our prisons. We want to be able to enjoy the comfort of our own homes in our later years. But with nearly a fifth of our population expected to be over 65 by 2020, radical and urgent change is needed to ensure the nation's housing meets the growing and changing demands that this is bringing, and will bring in the future.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm offering a new deal for older people, backed with millions of pounds of Government cash, to ensure elderly residents get the support they need to live independently and comfortably in their own homes for as long as they can, with particular support for those leaving hospital. Older people will be able to get the adaptations, repairs and improvements to their home that they need, safe in the knowledge that the help they are getting is from trusted tradesmen and advisers - not dodgy dealers and fraudsters out to exploit their situation.
> 
> ""As Britain's population gets older, our homes must adapt to meet our changing needs. Today's multi-million pound new deal for older people will help achieve this.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1665613,New era of open government will drive innovation in public services,"A landmark agreement that gives councils and public bodies free access to government mapping data will unleash a wave of fresh thinking and innovation in public services, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The Public Sector Mapping Agreement (PSMA) will allow all parts of the public sector in England and Wales to access national mapping data for free, which when combined with digital technology will pave the way for an increase in new apps and websites that can improve public services.

This data will support a diverse range of services from the digital television switch over to reducing ambulance response times and improving school bus routes.

The new agreement will allow councils to work more collaboratively with private sector contractors and charities to deliver better, more innovative and more efficient local services.

The move forms part of the new Government's pledge to open up officially held information, so councils and public bodies can easily and efficiently improve local services and local people can see at the touch of a button how their local services are doing.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""We're opening the door to a world of government information that will allow the good ideas of ordinary people to become innovative digital solutions that improve public services.
> 
> ""Easy access to high quality mapping data will trigger an eruption of new public sector mobile apps and digital mash ups that can quickly and cheaply improve local services, from refuse collections to protecting local birds and animals.
> 
> ""And this is just the start. We want ordinary people to come up with their own solutions to local problems that suit their needs. Across government information is being made accessible and useful to as many people as possible in order to increase transparency and accountability. Individuals and communities will be able to get directly involved in issues that matter to them, and demand Government works harder to meet their needs.""

Chris Holcroft, Director and Chief Executive of the Association of Geographical Information said:

> ""The Public Sector Mapping Agreement (PSMA) offers enormous opportunity to help maximise the use of geographic information for the benefit of the nation.
> 
> ""Breaking down barriers and better enabling data sharing, the PSMA should help the public sector make better and more transparent decisions and allocate its resources more efficiently, saving time and money. In addition it should stimulate and diversify private sector opportunities to develop related geographic information products and services.
> 
> ""All these are important factors for real social and economic benefits and for wealth generation and innovation in these challenging economic times.""

The PSMA will provide free access for public sector bodies to all the national mapping agency's core datasets from April 2011. The new agreement will replace costly and inefficient contracts that many parts of the public sector have with Ordnance Survey, and triple the number of bodies that have access to the mapping data.

Economic analysis shows increased productivity associated with free mapping information increased the real output of local government by over £230m in 2008/09, and the PSMA is expected to multiply these effects further.

### Notes to editors

1. The PSMA includes a broad range of Geographical Information (GI) from Ordnance Survey. It includes OS MasterMap Topography and Integrated Transport Network Layers as well as smaller scales of mapping.

2. All public sector organisations will continue to have unrestricted access to OS OpenData where they can download and order a range of raster and vector mapping datasets. These include the detailed 1:10 000 scale OS Street View, Boundary-Line, which provides the electoral and administrative geography of the country, and Meridian 2 and Strategi which offer customisable views of Britain's topography.

3. Improvements in Ordnance Survey's licensing framework will allow the public sector to use the data, and data derived from it, to deliver or support any public sector activity, including where these are delivered in collaboration with contractors, third sector bodies or the public. Members may need additional licences to perform certain, limited activities (commercial or competing activities).

4. Communities and Local Government has entered into a commercial agreement with Ordnance Survey to pay for the PSMA centrally. This means that public sector bodies will not have to pay separate fees to use Ordnance Survey data provided through the PSMA. A 'Transition Plan' for the move to a PSMA from April 2011 has been published today and can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/transitionplanaug2010](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/transitionplanaug2010)

5. Research commissioned by the Local Government Association Group (Coote, A; Smart, A,2010) has found that the local government output for England and Wales has increased by over £230 million per annum in 2008/09 as a result of the productivity benefits using geospatial information - [www.lga.gov.uk/GIresearch](http://www.lga.gov.uk/GIresearch) (external link).

6. Examples of councils using mapping information to improve local services:

#### South Tyneside Council

South Tyneside Council has created the 'My South Tyneside' web facility. It is quick and easy to use and includes a ""My Nearest' search facility for finding schools, libraries and other local facilities as well as a property search facility based on the Local Land and Property Gazetteer (LLPG). An email alert service enables citizens to receive regular alerts which let them know about local news and changes such as planning applications and road works.

In 2009 the website had 38,295 unique visits and saved the council an estimated £146,669.

#### Cardiff City Council

Cardiff City Council used mapping information to map school catchment areas and plan routes for the free school bus service and school courier services.

Using OS data has meant children eligible for the free school bus service have been identified quickly and accurately. This has allowed the council to organise transport provision in a more proactive way, optimising the number of buses needed and tailoring bus routes to suit where the city's children live.

#### Daventry District Council

Daventry District Council has used mapping information to improve refuse collection routes.

This led to a reduction in the mileage travelled by refuse lorries by 12-13 per cent, increased capacity for vehicle washing, and virtually eliminated employee overtime.

Using the mapping information led to combined savings of £95,000. A further £153,000 of savings have also been identified through implementing a 4-day working week for refuse and recycling collections, which will mean the council will no longer need to purchase additional vehicles.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1648582,New estimates offer truer picture of street sleeping,"New additional estimates published today show that the number of people sleeping rough on the streets could be more than treble the official national Rough Sleeping Count - a truer reflection of the problem according to Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

The official count published last week showed there were 440 rough sleepers in England, but additional official experimental estimates published today showed the figure could be as high as 1,247. This is because for the first time, all councils have been asked to submit estimates of the number of people sleeping rough on the streets in their area.

Previously, only councils which deemed themselves to have a problem had to do an official rough sleeping count, which was then submitted. This meant that only 70 councils conducted street counts leading to a total figure of 440 rough sleepers counted in England.

However, a further 256 councils have now provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, many of them for the first time. This has added a further 807 rough sleepers - leading to a national total of 1,247 rough sleepers.

The new estimates follow calls from Mr Shapps for a review of how rough sleepers are counted and for a more comprehensive method of assessing the scale of the problem.

This is just one part of the Government's drive to ensure homelessness is given the attention it deserves. Mr Shapps is also bringing together Ministers in 8 different Government departments to work closely together to look at ways their respective policies and frontline services can help rough sleepers and those at risk stay off the streets.

Mr Shapps said:

> ""At first glance today's figures might seem like the number of people sleeping on the streets has trebled overnight - but the reality is that the situation on the ground has been much worse than the official rough sleeping count suggested for many years.
> 
> ""I've consistently called for an honest street count and today's new official figure is a much more comprehensive measure than in previous years. For the first time, all councils have been required to at least estimate the scale of the problem in their area, where previously they would not have contributed at all. So in some of our biggest cities, while local people would have seen people sleeping on the streets, official statistics in the past showed there was no problem at all.
> 
> ""This Government is serious about helping those sleeping on our streets and won't shy away from the true scale of the problem. Today's figures are a step towards getting a truer picture of the situation on the ground - but I want to go further.
> 
> ""That's why I've announced plans for an overhaul of the way we assess rough sleeping and why I am asking councils and charities to help us come up with a more credible method of counting. We need a measure we can all rely on if we are to bring people in off the streets and give them a long-term future.
> 
> ""The Coalition believes that good Government is transparent and open, even when it is difficult. By instigating a more accurate rough sleeping count Ministers believe they can shine a light on helping those most at need.""

Proposed changes to the way rough sleepers are counted include encouraging neighbouring authorities to hold counts on the same night, adjusting the timing of counts to capture rough sleepers who bed down later, and a greater role for voluntary organisations like Homeless Link to attend and verify counts. Charities and councils are being asked for their views on proposed improvements in a consultation also published today.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1851612,New homes bonus could offer lifeline to local youth projects,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps said new cash payments for communities who go for growth could offer a lifeline to local areas campaigning for more facilities for young people, and give teenagers across the country something to do during the holidays.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1851588)The New homes bonus could mean more money for youth projects.

### Cash for campaigners

Mr Shapps said that thanks to a new Government scheme where communities receive cash payments to spend as they see fit in return for giving the green light to housing development, local youth projects may also get the go ahead or existing facilities improved. In a boost for local campaigners he said this could be spent on new playgrounds, refurbished swimming pools or five a side football pitches if that is what the local community wants.

The Minister said that from Wanstead to Watton communities are calling out for new facilities for young people - but despite tight public finances a new five a side pitch doesn't need to be a football fantasy thanks to the New Homes Bonus. Mr Shapps called on youth campaigners across the country to contact their Town Hall to see what plans their council has to use this new Government cash.

### Reducing anti social behaviour

Mr Shapps believes this extra cash can also play an important part in reducing anti-social behaviour caused by teenagers having nothing to do or nowhere to go during school holidays, and urged councils to consult local residents on how this money could be used to tackle this problem.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Up and down the country teenagers are calling out for more fun things to do and places to go to meet their friends. But with public finances so tight many communities have given up hope on the prospect of new facilities.
> 
> ""But thanks to a new Government scheme where communities receive cash payments in return for building new homes many of these projects have a much needed lifeline. Communities themselves get to decide how this money is spent so if a lack of facilities for teenagers is a major problem then a playground or five a side football pitch could get the green light. Thanks to the New Homes Bonus a new five a side pitch doesn't need to be a football fantasy if it's what the community needs and wants.
> 
> ""So I urge all local campaigners to get in touch with their council to explore what plans they have to use the proceeds of growth to meet local needs and whether it can be used to get some of these projects off the ground.""

### Campaigns

There are hundreds of campaigns around the country for new or improved facilities for young people. As communities get to decide how to spend cash from the New Homes Bonus this scheme could help some of them get off the ground. Examples of campaigns include;

  * **Exeter, Devon**: Amateur football players faced losing five pitches at local playing fields run by Exeter City Council. Parents, clubs, coaches, Devon FA and Exeter City Football Club joined a campaign run by the local newspaper to keep the pitches open and more than 1,500 people signed a petition in support of the facilities. Local clubs have now been giving permission to take over responsibility for running the pitches - in future, they will be able ask the council that cash from the New Homes Bonus is used to keep the pitches open and make improvements, for the benefit of the local community.
  * **Darlington, Durham County Council**: A campaign is underway to get community support to raise up to £40,000 to install an all-weather pitch at Firthmoor Community Centre. It would replace the original tarmac surface which was put in when the multi-use games area was opened in 2007. Martin Landers, Development Manager at the centre. ""This pitch is now out of date and interest has dwindled with a football league recently folding. A new surface is urgently needed to get us up and running again as a much needed facility for the area. It would have huge health benefits, help reduce anti -social behaviour and raise money for the young people of Firthmoor""
  * **Jarvis Brook, East Sussex**: plans are currently being drawn up of what a new park could look like with residents then able to decide which plan they prefer. The ideas include:  
- An enclosed playground for young children  
- Seating and picnic benches, and  
- Fresh landscaping and community notice boards  
- A skate ramp, youth shelter and games area for football and basketball for young people  
Deirdre Harris, chairman of Jarvis Brook Residents Association, explained why the revamp was needed. ""It is very run down. The play equipment is about 25 years old and a lot of it is broken and unsuitable. So we want to encourage everyone to go there, right from the babies in the enclosed playground to the teenagers with a youth shelter, skate ramp and games area. It will have two ends - one where the houses back on to it for the little kids and the youth area by the car park.""

Through the New Homes Bonus Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years. Empty properties brought back into use will also receive a cash bonus and an extra £350 per house premium will be paid for affordable homes. This works out at £9,000 paid on average to each Band D home or almost £11,000 for an equivalent affordable home.

So if an area increased the number of homes by 1,000 units this could earn the community £10 million to spend as they see fit - whether on skate parks or other facilities for young people, council tax discounts or boosting frontline services such as rubbish collection.

This will mean that for the first time rather than having development forced on them from Whitehall through centrally imposed targets there is a reason for communities to support growth. Through, for example a new skate park giving teenagers something to do and cutting down on anti-social behaviour, communities will be able to see the benefits of development in their area for themselves.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1732290,New housing deal will mean new powers for councils and communities,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has outlined plans to devolve greater powers to councils to meet the housing needs of their local communities.

Currently, councils are required to pay the council house rents and the majority of receipts from the sale of land and homes to Whitehall, where it is then decided how best to redistribute the funds back to local authorities - known as the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system.

But today, Mr Shapps committed to changing the rules so councils will be able to keep all the rents and sales receipts that they collect. In return for these greater freedoms, some councils would be required to take on additional housing debt - but no council will take on a level of debt that is not sustainable for the long term.

Details of the new system will be announced as part of the forthcoming Spending Review, and will be introduced in the Localism Bill later this Autumn to enable the new system to start in 2012. Therefore the Minister has ruled out a voluntary deal with councils ahead of securing the new powers in the bill.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long councils have been left hamstrung in their efforts to meet the housing needs of their residents by a council house finance system that is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. The Housing Revenue Account subsidy is in urgent need of reform.
> 
> ""That's why I can confirm that we intend to scrap the current system, and instead replace it with something more transparent that will serve the needs of local communities without interference from Whitehall.
> 
> ""Subject to the Comprehensive Spending Review we will offer councils the opportunity to keep the rents they collect and the receipts from any house or land sales. This is a key step to transfer powers to councils and communities, so they are free to improve their local services in a way that best meets the needs of local people.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1795403,New legislation will extend the Right to Build across the country,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has announced that the new Localism Bill will extend a new Community Right to Build across England.

Previously, this new right was to be restricted only to rural areas - but today, Mr Shapps confirmed that communities across the country will also be able to use these powers.

In July, Ministers kicked off a national debate about plans for a new Community Right to Build, which will shift power from Government to local neighbourhoods, enabling them to deliver the new homes, shops and facilities they really want.

Any community organisation bringing forward new developments under this power will not need to make a normal application for planning permission, if it meets minimum criteria and has local support through a referendum.

The new Community Right to Build will be introduced as part of wider Neighbourhood Planning reforms - details of which are included in the Localism Bill.

Last year housebuilding fell to its lowest for any peacetime year since 1924. To turn this around, the Government is bringing forward a raft of measures.

As well as a Community Right to Build, £1bn has been allocated towards a New Homes Bonus, offering cash for councils who allow new homes to be built in their area. And £4.5bn will be invested over the Spending Review to deliver up to 150,000 affordable homes.

Not only will this give local people a much greater say over new building in their area, but it will also introduce the checks and balances needed to ensure these community-led plans fit into the local council's wider vision for the development of their area.

Because of these extra safeguards the Minister has decided that projects with the support of more than 50 per cent of voters in a referendum will get the go-ahead - rather than the 75 per cent previously proposed.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Whether in a village, town or city, it is local people who best know the housing challenges their community faces. I want every community to have the tools they need to work together and find appropriate local solutions.
> 
> ""That's why the Localism Bill will mean that the new Community Right to Build won't just be available for countryside communities - it will be open to anyone with the drive and vision to build homes wherever they live in the country.
> 
> ""These community-led developments won't need normal planning permission, but will instead need to pass the test of public opinion, and gain the support of more than half of voters in a local referendum. I hope this will prompt neighbourhoods up and down the country to consider the housing needs of their communities, and take up their right to build.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1916241,New powers for communities to cleanse their streets of clutter,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today called on residents to unite and decide how they will use new powers to do a spring clean of their streets, and get rid of the unwanted clutter that blights their neighbourhoods.

Communities will be given new powers to decide how they want their streets to look in future, and how they want existing streets to be changed to suit their needs.

A common complaint from communities across the country, both to Ministers and experts such as Living Streets, is that for too long their areas have been blighted by a unsightly mess of shop signs, billboards and railings that are unwanted and unneeded.

Previously local residents have felt powerless to act, but now new rules in the Localism Bill will mean communities can produce a neighbourhood development plan, which includes policies to improve the public spaces in their area.

This could include reducing street clutter and improving the quality of shop signs and other street furniture. Contributions from developers, which are connected to planning applications for new building projects, would then enable this work to go ahead.

Mr Shapps also argued that people wanting to see a change can get involved in other ways to make clear the clutter from their streets. He urged councils and communities to follow the example of Sutton where, with the help of local people, the council is working to tackle street clutter. Residents have been urged to come forward with their worst examples, which the council can then focus on and tackle.

Sutton is a Big Society vanguard area, and Mr Shapps said that other councils who want to follow their lead but are struggling in the face of bureaucratic burdens should get in touch through the Department's Barrier Busting website - saying that any council coming forward with suggestions for cutting red tape would be listened to.

It follows the launch of a nationwide campaign against street clutter, where people across the country were encouraged to contact their council with their concerns.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years too many streets across the country have been ruined by a tasteless jumble of shop signs, railings and billboards, and the people who live there have been left powerless to clear away this clutter.
> 
> ""Well enough's enough. We want to give power back to local people so they can decide what their neighbourhoods look like. So residents will soon have new powers to protect and improve the appearance of their neighbourhood.
> 
> ""But people don't need to wait; they can start taking action straightaway. Just like in Sutton, communities can go to their councils with local examples of street clutter and demand something be done. This is the Big Society in action - communities taking action to improve the lives of local people.
> 
> ""And if councils are facing an uphill battle they can follow in the footsteps of Sutton and get in touch with me - as Sutton has found, they will be pushing at an open door.""

Cllr Colin Hall, Sutton Council's Executive Member for Environment and Climate Change, said:

> ""We've made some enormous strides by working with local people to get rid of some of the clutter that blights our streets. The important thing is make sure it's our residents who design our streets not Whitehall bureaucrats.
> 
> ""We've held a street audit where we've gone along a street with traders and residents, looking at things like signposts, railings and lighting columns and asking the question: 'Are these really needed?' In one area, we've managed to do away with around 100m of guard railings and 17 separate traffic light poles on a single junction - without compromising road safety.
> 
> ""It's a relatively easy thing to do. Although it does cost some money to remove the street clutter, it can work out cheaper in the long run as we see lower maintenance bills.
> 
> ""We've still got work to do though. However, we're pleased to be working with Government to cut through regulation that stops our residents having the neighbourhoods they want.""

Tony Armstrong, Chief Executive of Living Streets said:

> ""Pedestrians have to struggle with unnecessary bollards, guard-railing and pointless signs on a daily basis so Living Streets welcomes initiatives to make it easier for local people to rid their communities of the clutter that blights our streets.
> 
> ""Community powers, stronger guidance from central government and a coordinated approach from local councils are all vital to rid our streets of unnecessary obstacles for pedestrians. Councils in particular should use this opportunity to ensure that de-cluttering is prioritised and championed across all departments to help both cost saving and responding to community needs.
> 
> ""Through our own audits with local communities and councils, we have found that stripping back street clutter transforms our streets from trip hazards to enjoyable open spaces where people want to walk. We welcome steps towards cutting the clutter.""

Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea's Cabinet Member for Transportation and Highways, said:

> ""We've been carrying out ward-by-ward streetscape reviews since 2003 so it's not surprising we are fully behind the Government's efforts to encourage councils and their communities to tackle street clutter. Over this time we've worked closely with local businesses and residents' representatives to identify ways to declutter their neighbourhoods, resulting in the removal of almost 1,000 unnecessary posts and signs. We've moved another 200 useful signs to lamp columns, walls or railings.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Localism Bill will give communities powers to plan for their areas and deliver the development they want through neighbourhood planning. Communities will be able to create a vision of what their area should look like. This will include shop signs, billboards and railings on buildings, as well as influence in deciding where new shops, offices or homes should go and what green spaces should be protected.

2. Many people have great ideas about how they could make their neighbourhood a better place to live. But sometimes barriers get in the way. Red tape, rules and regulations stop people putting good ideas into action. Ministers have set up a team of 'barrier busters' dedicated to helping local people put their ideas into action. To find out more about the barrier busting team, and how to submit your request for help, visit the special barrier busting pages at [barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link).

3. Other examples of councils tackling street clutter include the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council. Their most recent projects include:

  * King's Road - Unnecessary street furniture was removed. Street furniture that continued to serve a useful purpose or, where residents asked, such as heritage bollards, were kept. Where possible, the Royal Borough integrated street lighting columns with traffic signals, signage and litter bins; and

  * Improvement work to the area outside the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Fulham Road. These improvements  were designed to create an attractive space and to make it easier for the large number of people who use the area to move about more freely. Unnecessary barriers and clutter were removed to create a high quality public space for the hospital frontage: [www.rbkc.gov.uk/environmentandtransport/roadsandhighways/chelseaandwestminster.aspx](http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/environmentandtransport/roadsandhighways/chelseaandwestminster.aspx) (external link).

  * Exhibition Road - It runs from South Kensington in the south to Hyde Park in the north, is home to some of the most important visitor attractions in the country. By 2012 the crowded, narrow pavements and heavy traffic will go. In their place they will make a kerb-free surface across the length and width of the road. Pedestrians will have more space and vehicles will be limited to 20mph: [www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/exhibitionroad.aspx](http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/exhibitionroad.aspx) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2033457,New rules will help end prejudices about social housing,"New flexible tenancies will help end long-held prejudices about social housing and ensure it once again becomes a springboard for success, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

Mr Shapps said the flexible tenancies will end the lazy and patronising perception that social housing is a dead-end option for life.

Instructions published this week by the Minister will ensure that councils and housing associations will, for the first time, have genuine freedom to ensure that more people benefit from social housing.

Starting next year, new tenants will now get the helping hand they need for as long as they need it, rather than a single option of a home for life, ensuring more social homes are available to people who need them. Mr Shapps said for too long social housing has been seen by many as a second-class option, and these changes would restore its original purpose - to provide a flexible alternative to help tenants achieve their aspirations.

Ministers believe the current system has failed, and are introducing the most radical and fundamental reforms to social housing for a generation. The new instructions published this week are a key step in delivering that reform, and will make social housing fairer by striking a sensible balance between the needs of new and existing tenants, whose tenancies will not be affected.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For too long social housing has been seen by many people as a byword for failure, a home for life in a dead-end street. I want to restore pride to social housing, so a social tenancy is once again seen as a launch pad to fulfil aspirations.
> 
> ""That's why I have published new instructions for councils and housing associations so, for the first time, they have genuine freedom to ensure more people benefit from living in a social home.
> 
> ""These changes will not affect existing tenants, but allow landlords to make more housing available for those most in need and give people the helping hand they need, for as long as they need it, including lifetime security where it is appropriate.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Directions to the Regulator can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulatorresponse](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulatorresponse).

2. The new standards include:

  * Tenure reform: to allow social landlords to issue flexible tenancies, subject to conditions, to make better use of existing and future stock. In implementing these reforms, we will respect the rights of existing secure and assured tenants.

  * Mutual exchange: to enable access to internet-based mutual exchange schemes to give tenants who want to move the best possible opportunity of finding a match.

  * Tenant involvement: to strengthen landlord accountability to tenants and support the Tenant Cashback model, providing new opportunities for social housing tenants to get involved in commissioning repair and maintenance service for their homes.

  * Rent: to make changes to reflect the introduction of the Affordable Rent model.

  * Quality of Accommodation: to clarify that providers are expected to maintain their stock at a decent level.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1926863,New scheme to offer first-time buyers an alternative to the bank of mum and dad,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today encouraged aspiring first-time buyers across the country, to come forward for new Government help to get a foot on the property ladder.

The Minister launched the new FirstBuy scheme, specifically designed to help those struggling to buy their first home due to the need for large deposits.

He confirmed that over 100 housebuilders will take part by offering their new-build homes to first-time buyers.

Through FirstBuy, the Government and housebuilders together will offer a 20 per cent equity loan, which alongside a five per cent deposit from the buyer will enable them to take out a 75 per cent mortgage on the rest of the property.

Loans will be repaid on resale of the property, with the Government's share available for reinvestment in more affordable housing. The first homes are expected to come on stream in September this year.

FirstBuy will help over 10,000 first time buyers in England over the next two years, with up to £500 million being available across the UK.

And because the scheme is only available on new-build properties, it will offer a much-needed shot in the arm to the housing market and the construction industry - supporting thousands of jobs.

Subject to contracts signed over the summer, housebuilders that will be able to offer homes for sale through FirstBuy will include:

  * Persimmon Homes
  * Barratt Homes
  * Bovis Homes Limited
  * CM Yuill Limited
  * Galliford Try Homes
  * Morris Homes Limited
  * Radian
  * The Miller Group Limited; and
  * Taylor Wimpey

Key lenders are also backing FirstBuy by preparing to offer 75 per cent mortgages to those first-time buyers making the most of the scheme.

They include:

  * Halifax
  * Nationwide
  * Barclays; and
  * The Melton Mowbray Building Society.

And today, Mr Shapps called on those looking to buy their first home to contact their local HomeBuy Agent to register their interest in the scheme. To find your local agent, visit: [www.homebuy.co.uk](http://www.homebuy.co.uk/).

Grant Shapps said:

> ""With 80 per cent of young first-time buyers depending on parental help, I am determined that we pull out all the stops to help those who want to take their first steps onto the property ladder.
> 
> ""FirstBuy will do just that - a Government-backed scheme making £500 million available to offer a valuable alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad. Over the next two years, this will help as many as 10,000 people in England to get that much-needed deposit together and realise their dreams of owning their own home.
> 
> ""And because this help will be available on newly-built properties, it will also offer a much-needed boost to our housebuilding industry, supporting thousands of jobs across the country.""

Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Housebuilders Federation, said:

> ""Firstbuy will help first time buyers, boost economic growth and provide a vital shot in the arm for the house-building industry. Our members have reacted decisively to support FirstBuy and recognise the scheme is an important first step.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1842912,New scheme will offer hope to millions on housing waiting lists,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today launched a major new scheme to deliver affordable homes for those in need, providing a potential lifeline to some 4.5 million people on social housing waiting lists.

He outlined the next steps in the most radical shake-up of social housing for a generation, with a new Affordable Rent programme giving landlords greater flexibility to meet the individual needs of tenants in their area.

And today, he published the framework for this scheme and encouraged not only traditional housebuilders and housing associations to consider building homes through the new scheme, but also smaller developers looking to expand into housebuilding.

Under the new scheme landlords will be able to offer homes to tenants on fixed tenancies charging a rent of up to 80 per cent of local market rate - one of a number of efforts being made to move away from the 'one size fits all' system of social housing to one where a range of options are available to meet local housing needs. The extra revenue raised from rents would then be invested in building new homes.

Alongside this greater private investment, the Government will also invest £4.5 billion to deliver up to 150,000 new affordable homes over the next four years.

The flexible tenancies will be for new tenants only - the lifetime tenancies and succession rights of existing council and housing association tenants will not be affected.

Mr Shapps today argued that with waiting lists having doubled over the past 13 years, social housing is ripe for reform, and landlords must have greater flexibility to find creative and innovative ways of meeting local housing need.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""With some 4.5 million people on social housing waiting lists, it's clear that not only do we need more homes, but we also need a complete overhaul of the system, to one that offers much more flexibility than the current 'one size fits all' approach.
> 
> ""The new Affordable Rent scheme launched today ticks both boxes. It offers landlords the freedom they need to offer a range of solutions to people's housing needs, while being able to raise extra rents to invest in house-building.
> 
> ""This new scheme will provide new affordable homes which could help some of the millions of families currently on housing waiting lists, let down by a rigid, outdated system that is failing to meet their needs. But this scheme is also part of the most radical reforms to social housing for a generation, vital to ensuring that as many people as possible benefit from this valuable resource.""

Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) which is responsible on behalf of Government for funding the new Affordable Rent model, said:

> ""This new way of operating will allow us to do more with less resources, but it will rely heavily on effective working partnerships between local authorities and Providers. The HCA will play a key role in supporting these.
> 
> ""Housing is only one element of the HCA's overall offer to help communities thrive. We will continue to work with our local authority partners in our capacity as enabler, to help them deliver the best outcomes for their communities, and housing is a key part of that.""

David Montague, chief executive at London and Quadrant (L+Q), said:

> ""We welcome the new opportunities to extend the range of affordable housing - the new flexibilities offered under the Framework will help to stretch grant when resources are extremely tight.
> 
> ""We want to create innovative new partnerships with local authorities and deliver homes where they need them. We look forward to working in partnership with both Government and local authorities to deliver quality new homes which people can afford.""

David Cook, chief executive at Kettering Borough Council, said:

> ""The current housing and mortgage market are particularly difficult. Against that backcloth, we need a clear signal that those areas which deliver growth will be well rewarded.
> 
> ""This scheme provides that signal as well as the means to bring developers, local authorities and, most importantly, communities together to meet housing need.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2060735,Next phase of local public audit,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today published the next steps on the road to a more efficient and accountable local audit system that will replace the Audit Commission's centralised inspection regime.

The Government is today publishing its proposals for the new arrangements for audit of local public bodies.

Following the decision to abolish the Audit Commission, the Government sought views last year on a new, more transparent and accountable local public audit framework that would both reduce the cost of public audit and maintain high standards of scrutiny over public money.

The Government will now begin a period of intense discussion with councils and audit firms so they can shape the practical details of the new, localised audit system. A series of workshops with council finance experts will begin this month.

The Government intends to bring forward legislation to formally close down the Audit Commission and introduce the new framework as soon as Parliamentary time allows. A draft Bill will be published for pre-legislative scrutiny in the Spring.

The new framework will free local bodies to appoint their own independent auditors from an open and competitive market. It will be based on the private sector audit model with transparent regulation overseen by the Financial Reporting Council and the National Audit Office. Separate arrangements will be developed for smaller bodies like parish councils.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today we are taking another step down to road to replacing expensive centralised local public audit with a more streamlined and competitive local audit structure. Councils are already showing they can be open and accountable - publishing details on their day to day business from spending to structure and taking control of their own auditing affairs.
> 
> ""The plans set out today will see Whitehall take another step back so that councils can begin to take ownership of their new audit system. Robust and independent external audit will continue. We want councils to be part of how we create a better, more efficient and transparent audit service that offers best value for money and properly serves taxpayers.""

In addition, as the Audit Commission is wound down the Government will put in place suitable transitional arrangements.

The Audit Commission is currently in the process of outsourcing its in-house audit practice. The contracts will start from 2012-13 and are expected to run for three to five years to ensure best value for money and give local bodies the time to plan for appointing their own auditors.

Once these outsourced contracts have been awarded the Commission will further downsize in readiness for final closure. This smaller body will be responsible for overseeing the contract period after which the new arrangements will come into effect.

Vernon Soare, Executive Director of Professional Standards at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), said:

> ""The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales understands the importance of the proper stewardship of tax payers' money by local public bodies and the need to provide good value and effective public services to citizens. We welcome the publication of the proposals and the clarity over the next steps. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales will continue to assist the Department for Communities and Local Government with its work on the new public audit regime.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Government Response to the Consultation on the Future of Local Audit is available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localauditgovresponse](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localauditgovresponse). The consultation ran from March to June 2011. Over 450 responses were received, mostly from local bodies and their representative bodies.

2. While the new arrangements are being finalised, the Audit Commission is in parallel outsourcing the audit work currently done in-house. This means all audits will be done by private firms from 2012-13, with regulation and guidance still overseen by the Commission until the new regime takes effect. This will allow the Audit Commission to become smaller and more streamlined, minimising costs to local bodies in this transitional period. The Department will be seeking views from local bodies on whether the outsourcing contracts should last for three or five years. The new arrangements will come into effect at the end of those contracts.

3. The Deaprtment for Communities and Local Government is working closely with smaller bodies, particularly their representative groups such as the National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks, to identify the most proportionate and effective framework for the sector. Peter Lacey, of the National Association of Local Councils, and Steve Parkinson of the Society of Local Council Clerks said: ""We look forward to working with the Department for Communities and Local Government over the coming months to achieve proportionate and cost-effective arrangements for the 9,900 smaller bodies in England.""

4. Ministers will ask Parliament to approve a new role for the National Audit Office, producing the Code of Practice and supporting guidance to set out the framework for the audit of local public bodies. The National Audit Office will consult key partners in developing a risk-based and proportionate approach to the value for money element of local public audit.

5. The Financial Reporting Council will be the overall regulator, mirroring its role under the Companies Act 2006. The Financial Reporting Council will be responsible for recognition and supervision of Recognised Supervisory Bodies (professional accountancy bodies responsible for supervising the work of auditors, and for putting rules and arrangements in place which their members must fulfil before they can be registered auditors, monitoring the quality of audits, and investigating complaints, disciplinary cases etc.)

6. The Accountancy and Actuarial Disciplinary Board (part of the Financial Reporting council) investigates significant public interest disciplinary cases and can impose sanctions on those auditors found guilty of misconduct in both the companies and public sectors. It will continue to exercise these powers in regard to local public audit.

7. Local public bodies will have a duty to appoint an auditor from the register of local public auditors, on the advice of an Independent Auditor Appointment Panel. The appointment process will be transparent. Local public bodies will be required to publish details of the auditor appointment on their website within 28 days of making the appointment, together with the Independent Audit Appointment Panel's advice and, if they did not follow that advice, a statement explaining why. We intend to work with the sector to produce guidance which would set out how the responsibilities of the Independent Audit Appointment Panel could be exercised.

8. The Government Response sets out how the proposed new arrangements might need to be flexed for different local public bodies such as Police and Crime Commissioners or Passenger Transport Executives. Audit arrangements for local health bodies (such as the Clinical Commissioning Groups proposed in the Health and Social Care Bill before Parliament) are not included. The detailed arrangements will be specified in due course.

9. Local public bodies will be required to appoint an auditor by 31 December in the year preceding the financial year to be audited, and notify the Secretary of State if they have not done so. The Secretary of State will be able to direct the local public body to appoint an auditor or make the auditor appointment directly. In addition to meeting the cost of the appointment the local public body could be subject to a sanction for failing to make the appointment.

10. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is likely to play a key role in the new framework as a Recognised Supervisory Body, building on the similar role it already plays in relation to audit in the private sector (alongside several other organisations who are also designated as Recognised Supervisory Bodies).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1795391,Next steps in delivering a better deal for council house tenants,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced the steps Government will take to overhaul the complex system of council house finance and return financial control to councils themselves - enabling them to offer a better deal to England's four million council tenants.

Today's route map to deliver a more transparent and accountable system of council house financing that places councils firmly in the driving seat is part of the Government's wider programme of devolving more financial freedom to councils.

As part of this Mr Shapps announced an extra £116million funding allocated each year for councils to pay for disabled adaptations to homes and an extra half a billion per year for councils to spend on their stock. He said that these reforms will ensure councils can plan effectively for the long term - enabling them to unlock over £6 billion estimated efficiency savings over 30 years which they will be able to plough into new investment.

Following the review announced in the Coalition Agreement, Ministers announced in October that they would replace the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system where councils are required to pay council house rents to Whitehall which decided how best to redistribute it. This meant that councils had no certainty about future income, no ability to plan long term and little incentive to be more efficient.

This opaque, centralised system will be replaced with one that provides a direct link between the rents councils charge, the money they spend, and the services they deliver. This means tenants and local taxpayers will be able to hold their landlord to account for the cost and quality of their housing. This will be achieved via a reallocation of housing debt after which councils will retain all the rental income they collect.

The Localism Bill, to be published today, will include measures to repeal the existing subsidy system and replace it with powers for the Secretary of State to introduce self-financing. Subject to Parliamentary approval these changes will begin in April 2012. The current system will continue to run during 2011/12.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long, councils have been frustrated in their efforts to meet the housing needs of their tenants by a discredited system for financing council housing. Our new approach will devolve power and sufficient resources to councils to enable them to offer a better service to tenants. And tenants and local taxpayers will be able to hold their landlord to account for the cost and quality of their housing.
> 
> ""Today I am setting out the steps we will take to deliver this more transparent and accountable system fairly and openly based on accurate valuations. These reforms are part of our wide-ranging programme of pushing power away from Whitehall to town halls and local areas. We estimate that by putting councils firmly in control of council house finance they can unlock over £6 billion of efficiency savings which they will be able to plough into new investment.
> 
> ""We are committed to helping the most vulnerable people in our communities so as part of this deal I am pleased to announce an extra £116 million a year to help councils prioritise adaptations for disabled residents. This will make a huge difference to thousands of people across the country - in many cases ensuring they can continue to live independent lives. We are also correcting decades of under-funding in the sector by providing around half a £ billion of extra funding for councils to spend on their stock each year.""

### Notes for editors

1. The precise details of the self-financing settlement will continue to be finalised over the next year to ensure they take account of any relevant changes in economic circumstances - for example up to date valuations of each councils housing stock. Government will then confirm that the settlement is fair and sustainable and should be implemented in 2012 (subject to Parliamentary approval).

2. The method for calculating the debt reallocation will be based on a 30 year notional business plan of income and expenditure for each landlord. A payment to or from each council will then be made to reflect the difference between the value of the business and the housing debt currently supported under the HRA. Income assumptions built into the valuation will be based on the existing social rent policy for councils that that their rents should converge with standard housing association rents in 2015/16.

3. How these reforms will work in practice, together with the underpinning model including updated indicative numbers per council will be set out in a policy document in the New Year. This will also set out the updated methodology in more detail and will incorporate the following parameters:

  * a discount rate of 6.5 per cent for calculating the net present value of each council's housing business;
  * providing for realistic expenditure for management, maintenance and major repairs as identified in independent research published last year, increasing the costs used in the valuation by an average of 11.7 per cent;
  * £116 million of extra funding each year for councils to pay for disabled adaptations to their stock;
  * funding for Treasury Management costs and to reflect planned demolitions;
  * Government continuing to pay subsidy to local authorities for the PFI schemes currently funded through the HRA;
  * 75 per cent of net receipts from any Right-to-Buy sales continuing to be returned to the Exchequer. Estimates of the loss of income from RTB sales will be built into the valuation of each council's housing business. Receipts from other disposals will continue to be held locally to spend on affordable housing or regeneration; and
  * Council landlords being subject to a cap on overall housing borrowing for each local authority. This cap will be linked to the opening debt level under self-financing.

4. Using today's figures, economic assumptions and these parameters, the net receipt to the Exchequer from these transactions is projected at approximately £6.5 billion. These will be updated in the model issued alongside the policy document expected in the New Year and before the implementation of self-financing using the latest data and economic assumptions.

5. This projected receipt includes £1.2 billion attributable to the decision to continue funding PFI separately. Local authorities with PFI schemes will share this extra amount but will continue to receive subsidy. This was the option preferred by all local authorities with PFI schemes.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1804082,Next steps on the road to zero carbon,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced the Government is on track to turn its commitment for greener homes into a reality, and set out the next steps to new homes being zero carbon from 2016.

With over a quarter of all the UK's emissions coming from homes, there is widespread consensus that quick and effective action needs to be taken to set a clear environmental standard for future homes to ensure that they do not add to the UK's carbon footprint. 

To speed up progress towards finalising a zero carbon approach, Grant Shapps asked the Zero Carbon Hub to gather the evidence about where to set a national benchmark for measures that can be taken on-site to reduce carbon emissions. The Hub's work brought together academia, industry experts and green groups such as the World Wildlife Fund, the Energy Saving Trust, and the UK Green Building Council.

Their findings, presented to the Government today, set out the evidence for what works, and what will deliver real-world carbon savings. The recommendations include reductions that can be achieved beyond the bricks and mortar - building homes with renewable energy technologies on site, such as solar power and heat pumps.

Mr Shapps also confirmed the Government is exploring how housebuilders can reduce the carbon footprint of new homes by supporting renewable energy schemes in their local area. Many groups have argued for a Community Energy Fund, which would enable zero carbon to be met partly through contributions to a fund used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Mr Shapps said the Community Infrastructure Levy, which was recently finalised, will give councils the option for new housing development in their area to contribute funds towards local renewable energy generation.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""We are committed to ensuring that new homes do not add to our carbon footprint. But whilst making sure these tough environmental standards are met, we will not dictate how every home should be built. So I welcome the findings of the Zero Carbon Hub, and will consider them with real interest.
> 
> ""We're serious about building greener homes, but also committed to finding the most practical way of doing this. And for good reasons - if we're going to be successful in reducing our carbon emissions, we need to ensure the councils and developers who are actually going to deliver these changes are on board.
> 
> ""That's why we're also giving the people at the sharp end of delivering zero carbon further options to invest in local renewable energy schemes, which will provide councils and developers the flexibility they need to meet these standards.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1792370,Next steps towards fairer social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced further details about the new scheme that will allow housing associations to offer flexible tenancies and deliver more affordable homes.

From 2011, housing associations will have an additional Affordable Rent option to offer households who need support. Affordable Rent properties will give housing associations the flexibility to offer fixed term tenancies to some new tenants at a rent level higher than social rent - with landlords able to set rents at up to 80 per cent of local market rents.

Landlords will be able to offer the new tenancies in return for investment agreements, which will enable them to raise funds to build more affordable housing. The flexible tenancies will be for new tenants only - the lifetime tenancies and succession rights of existing council and housing association tenants will not be affected.

The Affordable Rent model is the first step towards delivering these wider reforms announced last month and to be included as part of the forthcoming Localism Bill.

The Government is investing £4.5 billion to deliver up to 150,000 new affordable homes over the next four years, with around £2bn of this funding to support the delivery of new Affordable Rent homes. Ministers intend to make the payment of grant funding conditional on transparency.

Ministers believe the current centrally-determined system for social housing has led to the number of people on waiting lists over the past 13 years to almost double to five million. Affordable Rent is part of a package of measures that will affect all areas of social housing policy, giving councils and housing associations more flexibility to use their social housing stock to the maximum effect and drive down waiting lists.

In a statement published in Parliament today, Mr Shapps set out how the Affordable Rent scheme will work. Early next year, the Homes and Communities Agency will publish a full framework document that will form the basis for bids from housing associations who are interested in offering Affordable Rent.

Housing associations will have the flexibility to convert vacant social rent properties to the new flexible tenancies at a rent level of up to 80 per cent of market rent - but only after they have reached an investment agreement with the Homes and Communities Agency about how additional rental income will be reinvested in delivering new affordable housing.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""With five million people languishing on waiting lists, it's clear we need to act quickly to completely overhaul the system for social housing. That's why today I am setting out the next steps towards a smarter system - one that ensures housing associations have the flexibility they need to target help at the people who really need it, for as long as they need it.
> 
> ""While we will not change the arrangements for existing tenants, it's senseless to pretend, especially in times of economic hardship, that everyone accessing social housing is in the same boat, and needs a lifetime tenancy. Being able to offer a fixed-term Affordable Rent option will mean housing associations become even more effective in helping people get back on their feet, and ensure more affordable homes are built for every pound of taxpayers' money that is spent.""

The Government has embarked on a radical programme to shift power from Westminster to councils and communities, including a fundamental reform of social housing. The proposals include giving greater flexibility to both council and housing association landlords over the types of tenure they can offer to new social housing tenants. Many of the changes will require legislation and will be includes in the Localism Bill that will be published shortly.

The Affordable Rent model is the first step towards delivering these wider reforms. Housing associations will be able to offer Affordable Rent on fixed term tenancies, but they will also retain the option to offer lifetime tenancies should they wish to do so.

Under the plans, Affordable Rent properties will be allocated in the same way that social rent properties are now. Existing lettings arrangements operated by councils and housing associations will continue to apply and properties for Affordable Rent will be made available through choice-based lettings where appropriate.

Where a landlord decides not to reissue an Affordable Rent tenancy at the end of the fixed term, the landlord will need to provide advice and assistance to help the tenant find suitable alternative accommodation. Landlords and tenants will be able to consider a range of end of tenancy options, including selling the property to the tenant via conversion to shared ownership.

### Notes to editors

1. The parliamentary statement with further details of the new Affordable Rent model to be offered by housing associations from April 2011 will shortly be available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website.

2. The Government has embarked on a radical programme to shift power from Westminster to councils and communities, including a fundamental reform of social housing. Details of the proposals, some of which will be subject to consultation, are published in Local decisions: a fairer future for social housing. A copy of the paper can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingreform](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingreform).

3. Housing associations will be able to let an Affordable Rent property at up to 80 per cent of market rent for an equivalent property for that size and location. The association's calculation of the market rent would need to be based on a residential lettings estimate for a property of the appropriate size, condition and area.

4. The statutory and regulatory framework for allocations provides scope for local flexibility. Councils and housing associations may wish to exercise this discretion in relation to Affordable Rent in order to meet local needs and priorities in the most effective way possible (for example, through the adoption of appropriate local lettings policies).

5. The maximum annual rent increase on an Affordable Rent property will be RPI + 0.5 per cent. However associations will be required to rebase the rent on each occasion that a new tenancy agreement is issued (or renewed) for an Affordable Rent property. This requirement overrides the RPI + 0.5 per cent limit and will ensure that the rent set at the beginning of each new tenancy is no higher than 80 per cent of the market rent.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1906804,No complacency in the drive to build more homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today welcomed new figures that show the country is starting to build more homes again, following the devastating collapse in construction during the economic downturn and the era of top down targets.

Increasing the rate of housebuilding is a top priority for the Government. Powerful incentives have been introduced through the New Homes Bonus, so communities have a reason to say yes to new development.

The latest figures published today show that there were just over 29,000 housebuilding starts in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of 26 per cent compared with the previous quarter, and the highest quarterly figure for almost three years. Annual housing starts have also increased, with a rise of 22 per cent compared with the 12 months to March 2010.

Mr Shapps said the results show reasons for optimism in the construction sector, but was crystal clear there would be no room for complacency in the drive to build more homes after the previous system of top down control left the country with the lowest rate of peacetime housebuilding since 1923-4.

Government plans are well under way for a wholescale return of powers to councils and communities, so they can make their own decisions on housing and development issues and boost economic growth.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""When this Government came to power last year we surveyed the smoking wreckage of the construction sector and made a promise - that we would take swift and bold action to get Britain building again.
> 
> ""Today's figures are welcome, but they are only the start of the story. I'm determined that there should be no slowing down on the road to recovery, so we will continue dismantling the failed Regional Strategies and their legacy of animosity between developers and communities, and return powers to the local level so communities can drive economic growth and create new jobs in their area.
> 
> ""The construction industry that builds the homes this country desperately needs can also expect more help. We will work closely with housebuilders and listen to their suggestions about how we can improve, and continue to strip away the bureaucracy and red tape that for so long has piled unfair costs on this vital sector of our economy.
> 
> ""The first cash payments under the New Homes Bonus have been made, so communities can experience the benefits that growth brings. Totalling almost £200 million, these payments are a significant amount of funding at a time when public finances are tight, and it's now crucial that councils talk to their communities about how they would like to spend this money, and what growth they would like to see in future.""

Ministers are committed to put in place a package of reforms that address all issues across the housing sector. These include:

  * assisting first time buyers who are struggling to purchase a home in the market due to large deposit constraints

  * supporting private sector growth by reducing regulation and other burdens on house-builders

  * transferring power from central government to councils and local people, so that they can shape development in their areas

  * replacing top down targets with powerful cash incentives so, instead of simply feeling the strain that new building projects place on existing services, communities will now have a reason to support new development; and

  * accelerating the release of public sector land for new development.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1939203,No Second Night Out' shows tough action to tackle rough sleeping,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced the Government's ambition to put an end to rough sleeping by pledging to work with councils and the voluntary sector to ensure that nobody spends a second night sleeping rough on Britain's streets.

Mr Shapps said that the national roll out of 'No Second Night Out' to tackle rough sleeping showed that the Government would not let tough challenges get in the way of taking action to protect the most vulnerable in society. And he announced a new £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund for the voluntary sector to help deliver the pledge.

'No Second Night Out' identifies new rough sleepers and helps them off the streets immediately so that they do not fall into a dangerous rough sleeping lifestyle. By identifying where they are coming from, it also helps to improve prevention and recovery services for those prone to ending up spending the night in a shop doorway or on a park bench.

Currently operating as a pilot in London, 'No Second Night Out' has helped prevent 135 people from spending a second night on the streets since it was launched earlier this year with the Mayor as part of his wider strategy to end rough sleeping in the capital by 2012.

During a visit to St Mungo's Endell Street rough sleeping hostel in central London, Mr Shapps confirmed that the Government would work with local councils and charities to extend the principles of 'No Second Night Out' to towns and cities across the country. And he said he has asked Homeless Link, the national organisation representing homelessness charities in England, to administer a new fund to ensure that the voluntary sector continue to play a central role in tackling rough sleeping.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I am shocked and saddened that I still see people living on our streets. I am more shocked that some people still, in the 21st century, see the problem of homelessness as something that cannot be solved. It can. None of us want to live in a society where people are forced to sleep in shop doorways, on park benches or on our pavements.
> 
> ""That's why today I am making a pledge to work with councils and charities to ensure no one spends a second night out on the streets, and making a £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund available, to build on the excellent work in the capital as part of the Mayor's 'No Second Night Out' pledge.
> 
> ""'No Second Night Out' is a bold statement that shows that we are serious about putting an end to rough sleeping - which is at the centre of the Government's commitment to protect the most vulnerable in our society.
> 
> ""This comes from the first report from my ministerial group on tackling homelessness, which sets the bar on the best possible ways to help some of the most vulnerable in our society into stable accommodation. I want to see all communities making it their priority to protect the most vulnerable - and that includes helping bring rough sleepers off the streets.""

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:

> ""Since we created 'No Second Night Out' we've made amazing progress in stopping first nighters becoming long term rough sleepers. There is no reason why this critical safety net shouldn't help people across the UK so I am incredibly encouraged that the government is grasping the mantle and rolling it out nationwide.""

Jenny Edwards CBE, Chief Executive of the homelessness umbrella group Homeless Link, said:

> ""We welcome the Government's commitment to work with homeless charities to make sure that no one spends a second night out and the funding to help achieve this ambition.
> 
> ""In recent years, homeless charities have made real progress in helping those who end up on the streets back into homes, employment and a better future. More has also been done to prevent homelessness happening in the first place.
> 
> ""With homelessness rising and services facing funding cuts, it is crucial that we don't just maintain essential front-line help but that we make this help as effective as possible.
> 
> ""The Homeless Transition Fund cannot be a substitute for local authority money. However it will provide key front-line services with breathing space to secure their futures and to innovate - especially in communities that face an increase in rough sleeping.
> 
> ""In modern Britain, no one should end-up or be left out on the streets. Everyone needs to play their part in ensuring this does not happen - Government, charities and the public. This cross government strategy and the funding brings us one step closer to achieving this ambition.
> 
> ""We are committed to getting funding out to services as quickly as possible. Details of how services can apply will be announced shortly.""

The roll-out is one of six commitments made in a report published today by a cross-Whitehall Ministerial group tasked with preventing and tackling homelessness. The group was set up by Mr Shapps in one of his first actions as Housing Minister to looking to address the underlying and often complex issues that cause people to sleep on the streets.

Rather than dictate how 'No Second Night Out' should work in each area, in their report Ministers urge local authorities, who know their local circumstances best, to build on their ongoing work with local charities and hostels to adopt a gold standard approach to rough sleeping services that meet four key principles of the programme. They are:

  * Members of the public should be able to play an active role by reporting and referring people sleeping rough;

  * Rough sleepers should be helped to access a place of safety where their needs can be quickly assessed and they can receive advice on their options;

  * Rough sleepers should be able to access emergency accommodation and other services, such as healthcare, if needed; and

  * If anyone must come from another area or country and find themselves sleeping rough, to reconnect them back to their local community unless there is a good reason why they cannot return. Here they will be able to access housing and recovery services, and have support from family and friends.

### Notes to editors

1. The report published today can be found at [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/visionendroughsleeping](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/visionendroughsleeping).

2. 'No Second Night Out' was launched in London by The Mayor of London in 2011 and is a 24-hour helpline and website that members of the public, the emergency services and homeless people themselves can use to report and refer rough sleepers, with an outreach worker dispatched to contact the person as quickly as possible. The national scheme will be a multi-agency and cross-Government response to address the wider issues that cause people to sleep rough.

3. A new £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund will be made available over three years for the voluntary sector to help deliver 'No Second Night Out'. The fund will be administered by Homeless Link who will ensure that the funding goes to front line services.

4. The other commitments made in the report are:

  * **Helping people to access healthcare** by bringing partners together to identify what more must be done to include the needs of homeless people in the commissioning of health services;
  * **Helping people into work** by prioritising access to further education and skills services for the most disadvantaged, including homeless people, and promote informal adult learning as a pathway towards wider learning opportunities;
  * **Reducing bureaucratic burdens** by reducing the amount of guidance from central government and no longer require local authorities and providers of services to submit ongoing data returns;
  * **Increasing local control over investment in services** by analysing the costs of homelessness and the public services to which they fall and developing a proposal for the use of community based budgets to tackle the multiple needs of rough sleepers; and
  * **Devolving responsibility for tackling homelessness** in the capital to build on work already being led by the London Delivery Board to establish a pan-London approach to tackling rough sleeping.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2093814,Over half of London's rough sleepers now non-UK nationals,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today warned aspiring Dick Whittingtons from across the continent not to come to London before making firm plans, with figures showing that more than half the capital's rough sleepers come from overseas.

Grant Shapps issued his warning alongside a pledge of £18.5 million to provide advice and information for those at risk of homelessness.

It comes as the latest statistics for England published today show the number of people sleeping rough increased by 23 per cent since last year.

Separate data from across the capital shows that of all the rough sleepers in London, more than half now come from overseas. Mr Shapps said that the rising number of rough sleepers from Central and Eastern Europe in particular are putting extra pressure on homelessness services and acknowledged the excellent work being led by the Mayor's London Delivery Board on rough sleeping to tackle the problem through the No Second Night Out initiative.

To address this growing problem, Mr Shapps is backing a new campaign by London's Passage Day Centre to help make Eastern European citizens aware of the realities of moving to England to look for work before they pack their bags.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Non UK residents now account for over half the rough sleepers in our capital, so anyone heading here with tales of Dick Whittington in their head needs to realise that the streets of London and our other cities aren't paved with gold. Those arriving from beyond our shores to try and carve out a future in England should come with a thought-through plan to avoid the risk of sleeping on the streets.""

The Government and the Greater London Authority are also working closely with foreign embassies to minimise the problem, with embassies making it easier for rough sleepers to get the documents they need and providing advice and assistance to their citizens in both the UK and in their home countries.

Mr Shapps made clear however that this country provides some of the best support for rough sleepers in the world. Every country has different methods for counting rough sleepers, but with fewer than 450 rough sleepers in London compared to reports of up to 2,500 in New York and 5,000 in Paris, he said that the capital was dealing with the issue more effectively than many other cities internationally.

Today's rough sleeping figures are the second annual release since the Government overhauled the way councils conduct counts in their area. All councils are now required to provide a robust estimate or count of those sleeping rough in their area - in order to give a clearer picture of the scale of the problem across the country, and bringing the total national figures much higher than under the previous, voluntary system.

The Minister also confirmed £18.5 million for councils to help tackle and prevent rough sleeping among single people, ensuring that nobody is turned away without clear and useful advice when they are most in need. This comes on top of the existing £400 million grant this Government has protected for preventing homelessness.

The Minister also challenged local authorities across the country to follow the example of Merseyside, whose new commitment to ensure no-one spends a second night on the street is helping many people in the local area improving the chance they won't return.

Mr Shapps added:

> ""This country has some of the best homelessness services for those who become destitute in the world, but rough sleeping is still on the rise, and I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to prevent anyone spending a second night on the street.
> 
> ""Today I'm investing over £18 million to ensure that everyone has the advice and information they need to avoid homelessness. And with Liverpool now signed up to adopt the potentially life-saving 'No Second Night Out' commitment pioneered in London and other major cities making plans, in future no-one should ever spend more than one night on the streets.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2022983,Parish power can save struggling village shops and pubs,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today issued a new rallying cry to parish councils, to safeguard struggling village shops and pubs for the benefit of local people.

If a community shop, pub or village post office is threatened with closure, parish councils can use their powers to keep it running, including through the provision of financial support.

Parish councils can also start new community shops or services; by giving small grants or, where appropriate, borrowing to make an investment, such as purchasing a freehold on a property.

Ministers believe many parishes are not using these powers when they could, so Mr Shapps is making a new call on councils to sit down with their local community and make sure every effort is made keep rural services alive.

The Government is shifting more powers from Whitehall to neighbourhoods, so councils have new freedoms and flexibilities to protect local services and drive growth.

From next year new powers in the Localism Bill will enable parish councils, after negotiation with district councils, to offer discretionary business rates discounts for local businesses, and they will be able to better protect local shops through policies in their neighbourhood plan.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The village shop, pub or post office is often the beating heart of a community. So when one is threatened with closure, often for a reason as simple as the shop owner or pub landlord retiring, I would expect the local parish council to pull out all the stops to keep it going.
> 
> ""Some have done this brilliantly, but many have watched local amenities close when the power to save them was within their grasp. This is not about propping up failing businesses; it is often about providing temporary financial assistance or putting new community-run facilities in place, so vital services that people rely on are maintained.
> 
> ""So if an important local business is struggling, I would urge the parish council to sit down with their community and explore every option to keep it running for the benefit of local people.""

Mr Shapps said that he had seen many examples of where parish power had been successful, such as:

  * keeping a local Post Office in Worcestershire open by purchasing its freehold and keeping its rent low

  * borrowing to invest in a new community shop in West Sussex, which will offer a range of services and be a hub for the local community; and

  * using parish property in Devon to host a local Saturday market, and helping it expand by purchasing adjoining land.

Mr Shapps also called on parish councils to use National Pubs Week to start a conversation with the community about any local pubs that are under threat, and how they can be saved for the community.

### Notes to editors

1. Examples of where Parish Councils have been successful in helping local shops and services include:

#### Bishampton and Throckmorton Parish Council, Worcestershire

Bishampton had a village Post Office and shop for over 40 years until 2009, when the shop owner decided to close and the property owners sold the premises.

Seeing the vital role that the shop and Post Office had played in village life, the Parish Council decided to step in and keep it running for the benefit of the community, and after consulting with local people bought the building for the people of the parish.

The project was made viable by charging a subsidised rent for the shop and a market rate for the residential flat above. A shop keeper and postmaster were recruited, and the shop and Post Office re-opened to the public in February 2011.

The Parish continues to manage the project, which is funded predominately from the income of the flat above, and supplemented from the precept.

#### Milland Parish Council, West Sussex

For many years Milland Parish Council wanted a Community shop in the village that could provide much needed retail and postal facilities, as well as a cafe, internet access for those less confident using the web, and emergency deliveries of groceries for the elderly and infirm during bad weather.

The shop was included in the Parish Plan, and to start the project off the Council took out a £40,000 Public Works Loan, which encouraged other funding bodies to provide grants totalling £110,000.

Working with the local community, the Council team raised further funds that took the total raised to £168,000, and an extra £30,000 was provided through village fund raising and events.

The building is now nearing completion, and is expected to become a true community hub that complements the social activity of the Village Hall and local churches.

#### Ermington Parish Council, Devon

Ermington has a popular and thriving local market entitled 'Sustainable Saturdays', where local people can sell their home-grown produce. The Parish Council had supported the project by allowing it to use the Parish owned building and the Reading Rooms initially for free, and then continue by only paying a small rent.

The project has been so popular it needed to expand. In recognition of its importance to the local community, Ermington Parish Council talked to local people about expanding the venue, and received an overwhelmingly positive response from most residents.

The Council is now in the process of applying to the Public Works Loan Board for a loan, obtaining planning permission and seeking further funding towards the purchase of the land at the side of the Reading Rooms, so it can be extended and upgraded for the market.

The aim is to completely renovate the Reading Rooms, which can then be used for a whole range of purposes including the Sustainable Saturdays and, by the whole community.

2. Parish Councils can apply to the Public Works Loan Board if they wish to make an appropriate investment. The Board is a statutory body operating within the United Kingdom Debt Management Office, and whose function is to lend money from the National Loans Fund to local authorities and other prescribed bodies, and to collect the repayments.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1897428,People power in Liverpool beating neighbours from hell,"Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps and Baroness Helen Newlove, on her first visit as an adviser for the Department, have today visited Liverpool to see what the Government can learn from a local community that has come together to defeat the bullies and troublemakers in their area.

The Government has already announced plans to tackle anti-social behaviour by social housing tenants. A package of measures will strengthen the hand of residents, councils and housing associations to take on the neighbours from hell who inflict misery and fear on their fellow tenants.

But Ministers want to go further and faster, that's why Mr Shapps and Baroness Newlove wanted to see for themselves how an estate's recent tenant-led approach to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour has transformed the area, improving housing and the environment, and engaging the wider community.

Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years, there has been an abject failure to recognise that stronger local powers for the people who manage and live in social housing are crucial for tackling anti social behaviour.
> 
> ""I'm determined to change this - we've made a good start, announcing plans to introduce a new mandatory ground for possession, so any tenant convicted of serious anti-social behaviour can be evicted much more quickly.
> 
> ""But much more still needs to be done. That's why we're here today to learn from the people on the ground how local people power can smash the scourge of anti-social behaviour in social housing. The work on the Westminster Estate shows that, rather than being the helpless victims of abuse by a disruptive minority, tenants working together and supporting each other can tackle this menace head-on and reclaim their streets.""

Baroness Helen Newlove said:

> ""I'm delighted that my first visit as adviser to the department is to see how housing tenants can work with their landlords and with each other to beat anti-social behaviour. If we don't tackle anti-social behaviour around our housing, we'll never be able to take back our streets and make our houses feel like homes again.
> 
> ""What we can see in Liverpool is that when we place decision making powers and resources in the hands of those directly affected, they can deliver real improvements on the ground.
> 
> ""I look forward to using what we learn today, working with ministers, to give communities and social landlords across the entire country more powers and support so they can take a firm stand against the bullies and troublemakers who blight our neighbourhoods.""

Mr Shapps has already announced new local powers that will include an additional mandatory ground for possession, so those tenants with a track record of anti-social behaviour can be evicted from their council or housing association property much more quickly.

Ministers believe this will lead to a faster and fairer courts process - being found guilty of housing related anti-social behaviour in one court will provide automatic grounds for eviction in the county court, removing the need to prove the incidents of anti-social behaviour for a second time.

Mr Shapps has also announced that he will dedicate £300,000 of Government funding to a new central team to help tenants and landlords tackle the blight of neighbours from hell in their communities.

Under the recent initiative in Liverpool the landlord, Liverpool Mutual Homes, joined forces with Liverpool City Council, Merseyside Police, the Westminster Estate Tenants and Residents Association (WETRA), and the local Rathbone Youth Outreach group. Working together, the tenant-led project has helped improve services, reduce anti-social behaviour and make the area a cleaner, safer place to live.

Chief Executive at Liverpool Mutual Homes, Steve Coffey, said:

> ""The success of Liverpool Mutual Homes's partnership with Westminster Estate Tenants and Residents Association shows exactly what can be achieved by working closely with tenants and listening to their needs and opinions.
> 
> ""The estate was in poor condition and anti-social behaviour and crime levels were high but our investment programme has improved the physical appearance of homes and given people a sense of pride in their neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""The involvement of tenants in schemes such as the Intensive Community Payback has empowered them to take an active role in influencing the areas they live in.
> 
> ""We are now using this model at other our other estates across the city and I would encourage all our tenants to get involved to help us shape their communities and improve their lives.""

### Background

  * The Minister was joined by Baroness Helen Newlove, on her first visit as an adviser for the Department, where she will continue her work as the Government's champion for grassroots activists across the country who are working hard to make their communities safer.

  * The Government's champion for Active Safer Communities, Baroness Newlove, joined the Department for Communities and Local Government in April to continue her campaign for a 'people power' revolution.

  * The Baroness is a community campaigner based in the north west and was made a peer in July 2010. Since the death of her husband Garry in 2007 in Warrington, she has worked to make communities safer and championed the cause of victims of crime.

  * Her report 'Our vision for safe and active communities' makes recommendations based on her own experiences, and those of other activists to build happier and safer neighbourhoods.

  * Under the Westminster Estate scheme, Westminster Estate Tenants and Residents Association members act as the first point of contact for other residents, and help resolve issues in their neighbourhood. Residents are expected to outline their priorities at monthly 'have your say' meetings, take responsibility for the behaviour of their family members and visitors, keep diaries of any incidents, and report issues to the relevant agency.

  * They also help keep communal areas tidy, controlling pets, organising activities that represent the interests of the whole community, and keeping other residents informed of their work through a quarterly newsletter.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2065704,Powers over regeneration will remain with communities,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has today insisted that communities will be kept firmly in the driving seat and able to determine the future of their local areas.

In his response to a report from the Department for Communities and Local Government select committee, Mr Shapps rejected the committee's call for a top-down national strategy for regeneration, insisting that decisions on regeneration activities and schemes should rest with local people.

He today published a refreshed regeneration toolkit, highlighting the range of powers and tools devolved from Whitehall to Town Halls, businesses and residents themselves to drive the regeneration they want and need in their areas.

New tools introduced over the past year include:

  * greater freedoms for cities - bespoke ""City Deals"" to help England's eight core cities to create new jobs and generate economic growth
  * boost for housing development - including a £420 million Get Britain Building scheme which will help get stalled developments back on track; and over £150 million to help bring empty homes back into use
  * measures to support growth, including an additional £1 billion investment through the Regional Growth Fund; the £500 million Growing Places Fund; and Enterprise Zones
  * The Localism Act, including new community rights, neighbourhood planning, the general power of competence, and discretionary business rate discounts
  * £165 million support to help rural communities realise their full economic potential - including by increasing access to broadband.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We can't go back to the top-down, centralised system of the past which attempted to impose a one-size-fits-all approach to regeneration with little regard for the needs, circumstances and wishes of local people.
> 
> ""That's why I'm determined that communities, not Whitehall, can take the lead in shaping the future of their areas. Backed by a range of new freedoms and flexibilities introduced in a mere 18 months, residents, businesses, councils and social enterprises can take charge of how their neighbourhood develops and flourishes.
> 
> ""This is a radically different approach to the past decade, where regeneration was dictated nationally, and hugely dependent on taxpayers' investment. Now it is for communities themselves to set their own local priorities to drive their areas forward.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972525,Reducing red tape so councils can invest more in affordable housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced Government plans to give councils more financial freedoms to improve, buy and build new housing for their local community.

New proposals, published today for consultation, will allow councils more flexibility to trade their assets, and use the receipts to enable further investment in new homes and regenerating the local area.

Rather than seeking permission from Ministers in every case, local authorities will have greater discretion to use and improve their council housing assets in a way that best suits their community.

Mr Shapps said today's move was in direct response to requests from councils across the country to streamline the complex regulations governing these sales and use of the receipts.

The new rules will protect existing tenants and ensure the money is spent for the benefit of the local community. The new rules will not affect occupied homes unless the sale is to the tenants themselves. Where assets are sold, councils will be able to keep the majority of receipts, as long as the money is spent on housing or the regeneration of the local area.

The extra flexibility will complement the most radical reforms to social housing in a generation, which are currently being introduced, and which are designed to bring a fundamental shift of power from Whitehall to councils and local housing associations.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years councils have been hamstrung in their attempts to use social housing to its maximum effect, with a lazy consensus amongst politicians trapping one of our most valuable resources in a system that helps far fewer people than it should.
> 
> ""If councils want to use their assets to improve the availability of housing for their local community, it is ridiculous that they are forced to ask a senior Government Minister for permission in every case. That's why I am today proposing greater freedom for councils to enable the judicious sale of assets.
> 
> ""I also want to end the complex regulations that make it difficult for councils to boost local investment in new housing. Our proposals will streamline the rules so councils can recycle more receipts from these sales into improving the local availability of affordable homes. These changes will make the system fairer - councils will now be able to make decisions that genuinely meet the needs of local people, and the changes will not any affect any existing tenants.""

### Notes to editors

1. The 'Streamlining council housing asset management: Disposals and use of receipts - Consultation' is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/streamliningcouncilhousing](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/streamliningcouncilhousing).

2. Local authorities have powers under Part II of the Housing Act 1985 to dispose of council housing assets, but can use these powers only with the consent of the Secretary of State. Section 34 of the Act permits the Secretary of State to grant consent generally. This means where certain pre-conditions are met, a specific consent is not required.

3. Restrictions will apply to ensure this new power is used properly by councils. The disposal of housing assets at market value will not be allowed if:

> i. the disposal results in a tenant of the council becoming the tenant of a private landlord; or  
ii. the disposal is of a dwelling to a wholly owned subsidiary of the local authority (such disposals provide a means of avoiding the borrowing cap imposed under self-financing).

4. The Government is taking the opportunity of streamlining the regulations (the Local Authorities (Capital Finance and Accounting) (England) Regulations 2003 (as amended)) that govern use of the receipt arising from the disposal of council housing assets.

5. In addition to simplifying the regulations, the Government is clarifying in what circumstances the local authority must surrender 75 per cent of the receipt from a disposal to central Government. The proposal is for this to be the case when the sale is made to existing (or recent) council tenants. Receipts from sales to other individuals for owner-occupation may be retained provided they are used for specified purposes.

6. To facilitate the introduction of self-financing for social housing, these specified purposes will include spending on affordable housing and regeneration, and repaying housing debt connected to the particular asset being sold. Under the self-financing settlement, each local housing authority will take on a level of debt associated with each individual house or flat in its possession. It is therefore essential that when a local authority disposes of houses and flats it must have the option of clearing the debt associated with it. This will enable councils to maintain healthy balance sheets for their social housing, which is vital for continued investment in new housing.

7. The new powers will not affect current arrangements for Right to Buy.

8. Today's consultation is all about simplifying current processes. It means that where councils do want to sell certain stock (eg, selling to a former member of the armed forces to help them onto the housing ladder), they will be able to do so without first seeking permission from central Government. So this will lead to a speeding up of the process of selling a property - but not to any significant increase in the numbers of homes sold. The local authority must spend the receipt it gets on housing or regeneration.

The Minister argued that measures the Government is taking - including delivering 150,000 new affordable homes over the Spending Review, and greater flexibility for councils to manage their own waiting lists - will reduce the numbers of people waiting for years for a council home.

The Minister said that he wants to return to the central principle of social homes being available to help those who need it most, for as long as they need it - to tackle what he deems the ""the deepening sense of unfairness"" about how the country's social housing stock is used.

The Minister said that social housing in England has for too long helped too few, and has needlessly applied the brakes on tenant's aspirations and halted their ambitions. He argued that the social housing of the future must become more flexible and go beyond just putting a roof over people's heads.

Recent cases that have been brought to the Minister's attention include:

  * Two parents sharing their three-bedroom housing association home with their five children and two-year-old grandchild, who has learning difficulties. The oldest daughter has been on the council waiting list for years, and while she continues to live in the home her parents sleep in their small living room and have no privacy;
  * A family of four struggling to live together in a one-bedroomed flat. The family, which includes a two-year-old son and a young baby took the flat as the only council accommodation available at the time; and
  * A single parent struggling to pay her rent - when she split up with her partner, this mother took reduced hours at work to care for her young son. This has left her struggling to pay her rent and save for a deposit to buy a home.

The proposed changes - to be published in more detail today - are a key step in delivering reform and making social housing fairer by striking a sensible balance between the needs of new and existing tenants, and ensuring the support that social housing provides is focussed on the most vulnerable.

Mr Shapps also said he wants to see a return to the premise of social housing being a springboard to success. So he will say that whilst good, affordable housing should be available for those who genuinely need it - and for as long as they do - tenants have a responsibility to use it to achieve their aspirations.

Therefore, tenants will be supported in forming tenant panels and will have new opportunities to have a say over how their services are provided and to take over some of the responsibilities currently held by landlords - such as carrying out small repairs to their property - to allow them to build up their skills.

And by giving landlords the option of offering flexible tenancies as well as continuing to offer lifetime security where it is needed, better use can be made of the country's social housing to ensure more people benefit.

He said that successive Governments had promised to make social housing a top priority for decades, but that only now was the most radical shake up of social housing for 50 years being introduced to truly turn it into a springboard to help people make a better life for themselves and for their communities.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's time to pull social housing out of the sidings and onto the right track. I'm confident that the changes we're making will lead to the first substantial reduction in waiting lists for 22 years. For too long, social housing simply hasn't helped as many people as it could, leading to the deepening sense of unfairness that continues today. It has needlessly applied the brakes on tenants' aspirations and halted their ambitions - when social housing has always been intended to provide more than just a roof over their heads.
> 
> ""Up and down the country, families are speaking to their council in the hope of securing a social home as a hand up in life, but all too often they never get a call back. We need reform - real reform that radically overhauls a system that has five million people stuck on its waiting list. So we are introducing a new system of social housing in the most radical reforms for a generation, ensuring those in greatest housing need are given priority.
> 
> ""This new system will be more flexible, with councils and housing associations able to offer fixed term tenancies that give people the helping hand they need, when they need it. But above all it will be fairer - social landlords will now be able to make decisions that genuinely meet the needs of local people, and the changes will not affect the rights of existing tenants.""

1. Today's consultation documents can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulator](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulator).

2. This consultation outlines the areas on which the Government proposes to direct the social housing regulator to set standards. These are:

  * **Tenure reform**: to allow social landlords to issue flexible tenancies, subject to conditions, to make better use of existing and future stock. In implementing these reforms, we will respect the rights of existing secure and assured tenants
  * **Mutual exchange**: to enable access to internet-based mutual exchange schemes to give tenants who want to move the best possible opportunity of finding a match
  * **Tenant involvement**: to strengthen landlord accountability to tenants and support the Tenant Cashback model, providing new opportunities for social housing tenants to get involved in commissioning repair and maintenance service for their homes
  * **Rent**: to make changes to reflect the introduction of the Affordable Rent model
  * **Quality of accommodation**: to clarify that providers are expected to maintain their stock at a decent level

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2145337,Revamped Right to Buy to deliver thousands of new homes,"Details of how thousands of new affordable homes will be built using the cash proceeds from the Government's reinvigorated Right to Buy scheme were today unveiled by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

The Minister said he was responding to appeals by local authorities for more time to take advantage of the new scheme by allowing them three years to reinvest the funds they gain from additional sales into hew housing. He said councils now have a ""prime opportunity"" to refresh their housing stock and help meet the housing needs of hard-working families currently languishing on the waiting list.

The revamped Right to Buy, which will give 2.5 million social tenants the opportunity to buy their home with discounts of up to £75,000 was launched last month.

Mr Shapps has said his ambition is that, for the first time, every extra Right to Buy home sold will be replaced by a new affordable home to rent nationally. He said he had listened to views raised by councils on how they would deliver this ambition, and has agreed to extend their timeframe for spending the receipts from two years to three.

Under the new, light touch agreement between Whitehall and Town Halls published today, councils will have the opportunity to keep receipts from additional Right to Buy sales and the freedom to spend the cash as they see fit to meet local housing demand.

Councils will have the freedom to:

  * decide on the type, size and location of the new homes they build according to local needs
  * work with other organisations such as housing associations to finance and deliver affordable homes for their area; or
  * pass the cash to Whitehall to help deliver one-for-one replacement at a national level.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""By upping the Right to Buy discount to a maximum of £75,000 we've given hope back to thousands of council tenants who want to own their home, and for the first time in years, social housing is on the move.
> 
> ""For every extra property sold under Right to Buy we're giving councils the flexibility to build the homes they need, where they need them - or to work with us to ensure every penny raised through the scheme goes towards housebuilding. I've listened to their views, and they now have three years to make the most of the extra funds the scheme will bring.
> 
> ""This is a prime opportunity for councils across the country to refresh their housing stock, handing the keys to thousands of tenants who want to cross the threshold to home ownership and building new affordable properties to rent for local families who for too long have been left languishing on the waiting lists.""

To ensure best value for taxpayers' money, Mr Shapps said Right to Buy funds should account for no more than 30 per cent of total investment in new homes - in place of Government funding. This is in line with the highly successful Affordable Homes Programme, which has exceeded expectations and is expected to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015.

However, the Minister was clear that the new homes must be delivered as quickly as possible, which is why councils must spend the cash on new affordable homes for rent within three years of first receiving it. This has been extended from the original proposal of two years in response to feedback from councils.

And if additional Right to Buy receipts remain unspent after three years they will be returned to Whitehall to be reinvested in housebuilding nationally.

### Notes to editors

1. Additional Right to Buy receipts for councils that have not signed the Right to Buy agreement will immediately be passed on to the Homes and Communities Agency or the Greater London Authority for investment. Councils will then be able to bid for funding for investment in affordable housing from this pot.

2. Councils that wish to retain additional Right to Buy receipts for the first quarter of 2012/13, must sign up to the Right to Buy agreement by Wednesday 27 June 2012. Agreements can be signed after this date but will not cover receipts for Q1.

3. The agreement being issued today follows a short technical consultation in April 2012.

4. If Right to Buy receipts remain unspent at the end of three years they must be returned to central Government for investment by the Homes and Communities Agency or Greater London Authority. Similarly, if receipts constitute more than 30 per cent of total investment, then a sum equivalent to the overspend should be returned to central Government.

5. The remaining 70 per cent invested in new affordable homes must come from authorities' or housing associations' own resources, which could include borrowing supported by the additional rental income. (For local authorities this will be possible only if they have sufficient headroom to borrow under the recent Self-Financing settlement.)

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2057532,Revitalised Right to Buy will unleash a new generation of home ownership,"A revitalised Right to Buy will unleash a new generation of home ownership and ensure every home sold is replaced, Housing Minister Grant Shapps announced today.

The Minister published new proposals that will significantly increase the discounts available under the scheme, making it easier for some of the two million social tenants in England to buy the home they live in.

Mr Shapps said the restrictions on discounts over the past few years have made Right to Buy meaningless in many parts of the country, with fewer than 3,700 sales last year compared to a peak of 84,000 less than 10 years ago.

So the Government is proposing to increase the cap to £50,000, effectively trebling the discount in some parts of the country so more tenants can get a foot on the property ladder.

Thirty years after the original launch of Right to Buy, Ministers believe it can once again promote opportunity and boost social mobility for the nation's social tenants, and at the same time transform housing estates.

Ministers are committed to ensuring that there is no reduction in the number of affordable homes - so for the first time any additional home bought under the scheme will lead directly to the provision of a new affordable home for rent on a one-to-one basis.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:  

> ""When this Government came to power our inheritance was a paralysed housing market and a devastating collapse in construction. The builders had stopped building, and millions of hard-working, aspiring home owners were blocked from taking their first step on the property ladder.
> 
> ""This is especially true for people living in social housing. The previous miserly restrictions on discounts meant Right to Buy became, for many tenants, nothing more than an empty promise - a social mobility scheme run by Ebenezer Scrooge.  
> 
> ""That's why I am today publishing proposals that will dramatically increase the discounts under Right to Buy, ensuring it once again becomes a meaningful tool to support social tenants who want to buy the home they live in.
> 
> ""But we are also determined to maintain the number of affordable homes for rent - so for the first time, every additional home that is sold will be replaced by a new affordable home on a one-for-one basis. The new homes for affordable rent will help get the nation building again, and help councils meet housing need.""    

Proposals published for consultation today will see the cash caps under Right to Buy increased to a meaningful level of £50,000 across England.

This will mean, for example, that someone in the West Midlands who had been a tenant for eight years on an household income of £20,000 could buy their £90,000 flat with a discount of £50,000 compared to £26,000 previously - effectively doubling their discount.

In London, a tenant for five years buying a flat worth £160,000 would also receive a discount of £50,000 - more than three times the previous cap of £16,000.

Housing association tenants with a Preserved Right to Buy - because their home was part of a housing stock transfer from a local authority - will also benefit from the enhanced offer.

Proposals will now be discussed with key partners including landlords, lenders and tenant organisations. This will include ways to ensure tenants are fully informed about the new opportunities, and landlords are fully geared up to respond and support tenants' ambition for home ownership.

The consultation will also consider the different ways the receipts from additional Right to Buy sales could be used to deliver new affordable rent homes on a one-to one basis. This will include options where councils keep the receipts and deliver the homes, and options where the Government collects the receipts and allocates funds to councils who offer the best value for money.

The revived Right to Buy will support radical reforms being introduced by the Government that will untie the hands of councils so they can manage their social housing more effectively.

The consultation follows the announcement of the expanded Right to Buy in the Government's new housing strategy, which includes a comprehensive package of support for the housing sector. Steps will be taken to tackle a range of issues facing the housing market, from boosting supply and making it easier to secure mortgages on new homes, to ensuring homes that have been left empty for years are lived in once again.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1768252,Rewards for homes with the New Homes Bonus,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today pledged cash for communities who allow new homes to be built in their area. Almost £1bn Government funding has been set aside for councils that welcome new housing development, which they will be able to spend to benefit their local community.

In proposals published for consultation, the Minister has announced that the Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years through the New Homes Bonus. Councils and communities will work together to decide how to spend the extra funding - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres.

Mr Shapps said councils who have already set out their stall for growth are building up rewards for their local area, and all homes that are built now will benefit from the new funding. Councils will also receive a higher level of funding for building new affordable homes.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We are ending the system where the Government can tell communities what and where to build - that top-down approach slowed housebuilding to a trickle, so we need to take action now to get the country building again. That's why we've set aside almost £1bn so councils who build more homes start benefiting immediately from the extra cash, which they can spend on improving the local area.
> 
> ""For too long communities have fought against development because they can't see how it does anything to improve their lives. I'm determined to change this. The New Homes Bonus will ensure that those communities that go for growth reap the benefits of development, not just the costs.
> 
> ""Councillors will now be able to lead a mature debate about the benefits of development. And rather than being punished for not meeting targets, local communities will now have a reason to say yes to new homes, because they will benefit from better local services, or perhaps the redevelopment of their town centre in return for backing new housing.""

Executive Chairman of the Home Builders Federation, Stewart Baseley said:

> ""The country is facing an acute housing crisis and it is imperative we have a planning system that delivers sufficient land for the homes we need. The New Homes Bonus is an essential part of the new incentive based structure and we welcome the commitment to a simple, easy to understand system.""

Councils will benefit from a higher level of funding for encouraging new affordable homes to be built in the local area, with council tax matched and then supplemented by £350 per home each year for six years. Today's announcement follows the Government's commitment to invest £4.5bn in affordable housing over the next four years, which will deliver up to 155,000 new affordable homes.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation on the New Homes Bonus seeks views on the implementation of a powerful, simple and transparent system for incentivising local authorities to increase their housing supply. This follows the Coalition Agreement to provide incentives for local authorities to deliver sustainable development, including for new homes and businesses. A copy of the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/newhomesbonusconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/newhomesbonusconsult).

2. The long-term demand for housing is strong. Despite this, housing development has consistently fallen over the last decade. On average 26,000 fewer homes were built each year from 1997 to 2009, and in 2009 there were just 118,000 completions, the lowest level of house building in peacetime since 1924.

3. The previous Government tried to remedy falling levels of housebuilding by using centrally determined housing targets that local authorities and communities had to meet. These failed to deliver the housing this country needs. The Housing and Planning Delivery Grant (HPDG) that was introduced to support targets and improve housing delivery was ineffective and complicated, and local authorities could not rely on it as a sufficient and stable incentive.

4. A series of recent independent reviews by Sir Michael Lyons, Kate Barker and Professor Michael Ball highlighted the powerful role that local incentives could play in driving housing delivery. The current local government finance system does not provide the right incentive or rewards for councils to build new homes or bring long term empty properties back into use. If a local authority promotes the building of homes in the area it governs, little of the economic gain is captured by the local community. As a result existing residents see only further strain on public services and reduced amenity when new homes are built.

5. The proposed scheme will provide this incentive and return power back to local communities. £900m has been set aside to get the scheme up and running. Decisions on where and how housing development occurs will rest locally and ensure that the benefits of growth are returned to communities.

6. £946m has been set aside over the Spending Review period. In 2011-12 this is almost £200m and £250m in each of the remaining years. Funding beyond these levels will come from Formula Grant.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2102168,Safety net of support working to protect thousands at risk,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today said new figures, showing a 14 per cent increase in the number of households accepted for homelessness help in England last year, underlined that many people were still suffering from the legacy of a debt-laden economy. He urged people to seek early help if they faced the prospect of losing their home.

However, the number of households being owed a statutory homelessness duty was still lower than for 28 of the last 30 years - and half the average level seen during the previous administration.

A strong safety net - bolstered by extra Government help and new freedoms for local councils - is ensuring thousands of vulnerable families have a secure roof over their heads, Mr Shapps said.

The Minister said the Government had made an extra £70 million available to councils in the past year to assist households facing the prospect of homelessness. In addition to the £400 million homelessness prevention funding allocated for the current Spending Review period, local authorities are benefiting from funding including:

  * £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund to help protect vital front line services
  * £20 million Preventing Repossessions Fund to enable local authorities intervene earlier and help people stay in their homes
  * £20 million Single Homelessness Prevention Fund to help ensure single homeless people get access to good housing advice
  * £5 million boost to the Homelessness Change Programme to deliver improved hostel provision and provide over 1,500 new and improved bed spaces.

Mr Shapps said those at risk of homelessness should therefore be confident that their local authorities would be able to provide the help they needed.

Councils have a duty to provide help for households facing homelessness through no fault of their own and in priority need, and can provide free advice and information to prevent homelessness in the first place.

Councils will have greater freedoms to support those in need of a stable home - under the Localism Act 2011, they will soon be able to fulfil their legal duty to vulnerable residents who fall homeless by finding them suitable accommodation in the private rented sector. Until now, those deemed eligible for help have been able to turn down such an offer and hold out for social housing - leaving councils to foot the bill for expensive temporary accommodation and other residents languishing on the waiting list.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today's figures underline how the debt laden economy we inherited is leaving a legacy of hard-up households across the country. But despite this, homelessness remains lower than for 28 of the last 30 years - and is half the average rate seen under the previous Government.
> 
> ""Our strong safety net of support is keeping thousands of vulnerable people off the street, and I'm determined to take every opportunity to build on this. That's why on top of the extra funding, we will shortly be giving councils new powers to use suitable, quality homes in the private as well as social rented sector for those in the greatest need.
> 
> ""I would urge anyone in difficulty to seek early support. The clear message is, the earlier you act the more options are available to help you avoid homelessness.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1766348,Seek early help to avoid repossession,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today welcomed new figures from lenders showing that fewer homeowners are facing the threat of repossession.

New figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders released today show that repossessions in the third quarter of 2010 were down five per cent on the previous quarter, and 27 per cent less than the same time in 2009.

In August, the Council of Mortgage Lenders revised down their original forecast for the number of households being repossessed in 2010, from 53,000 to 39,000.

However, the Minister urged anyone facing the real prospect of losing their home to seek early advice and support to have the best chance of avoiding repossession.

Anyone with mortgage worries can visit the Directgov Mortgage Help website (see link top right) for free information and support, including the option to develop a tailored personal action plan to suit individual circumstances, while advice is also available from organisations including Shelter and Citizens Advice.

Mr Shapps also encouraged homeowners to speak to their mortgage lenders, who may be able to offer revised repayment options to help them avoid repossession.

But he also argued that the most important thing the Government is doing to help homeowners is to tackle the record deficit, to avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""While I am encouraged that fewer families are facing the frightening possibility of losing their homes, we cannot rest on our laurels. I would advise anyone with money worries that the best thing they can do to avoid repossession is to seek help and support as early as possible.
> 
> ""That's why we're keeping open our mortgage help website, so concerned homeowners can go online and develop personal action plans to get their finances back on track. This is in addition to the expert support available from a range of organisations including Shelter and Citizens Advice.
> 
> ""But the most important thing that Government can do to help keep repossessions low is to continue our efforts to tackle the record deficit. By doing this we can avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates, and keep the pressure off homeowners feeling the pinch.""

Latest figures also published today show that a Government scheme aimed at helping vulnerable households most at risk of losing their home, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme, has helped 1,598 households avoid the immediate threat of repossession with 475 homeowners having completed the full process between July and September and 1,456 since the scheme's launch in January 2009.

### Notes to editors

1. Anyone struggling with their mortgage can go to the Directgov Mortgage Help website (see link top right) for advice on getting their finances back on track.

2. Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that claims leading to a court order have fallen over the past three months by 28 per cent compared to the same period in 2009, and claims for mortgage possession by lenders between July and September this year were 19 per cent lower than during the same period last year. Of the mortgage possession claims that led to orders, 47 per cent were suspended. These figures can be found at: [http://www.justice.gov.uk/mortgatelandlordpossession.htm](http://www.justice.gov.uk/mortgatelandlordpossession.htm).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1708229,Sensible approach to manage shared homes,"Landlords and councils will no longer be faced with bureaucracy aimed at micro-managing rented housing, Housing Minister Grant Shapps confirmed today.

The Minister laid new regulations that could cut as many as 8,500 planning applications from the system, freeing up councils to focus on local priorities. Currently landlords have to submit a planning application to rent their properties to unrelated tenants - known as Houses in Multiple Occupation. Regulations published today will ensure councils only have to use this power where they know high concentrations of shared homes are a problem.

Too many shared homes in one area can cause problems. A high number of short term tenants with little stake in the community can leave an area with an unloved look and feel, which can sometimes create seasonal ghost towns that harm local economies, anti-social behaviour and an increase in crime.

But the Minister said that a blanket requirement to manage these through the planning system is a drain on council resources, and threatens to drive good landlords away from the rental sector because of increased costs and red tape, therefore restricting availability of affordable homes for rent.

Currently up to 8,500 planning applications may be added to the system each year if every landlord looking to turn their property into a shared home is forced to submit an application, regardless of local circumstances.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Councils understand their local area best, and they don't need burdensome rules that assume housing issues in every town, village and hamlet are exactly the same. I am also committed to safeguard the supply of rented housing - shared homes are vital for people who want to live and work in towns and cities, and are important to the economy.
> 
> ""That's why I'm giving councils greater flexibility to manage shared homes in their local area. Where there are local issues with shared homes, councils will have all the tools they need to deal with the problem - but they will avoid getting bogged down in pointless applications, and landlords won't be put off renting shared homes where they are needed.""

### Notes to editors

1. Councils are to be given more flexibility to manage shared homes in their area. The problems that arise from concentrations of shared homes are not widespread and the current requirement imposes an unnecessary burden on landlords and local planning authorities in those areas where shared homes are not a problem. It also runs the risk of reducing supply if landlords choose to move out of the sector rather than face the costs and delays of applying for planning permission.

2. The definition of a small HMO (the C4 use class) will remain and permitted development rights will be extended to allow all changes between the C4 and C3 classes without the need for planning applications. In areas where there is a need to control HMO development, local authorities will be able to use an Article 4 direction to remove these permitted development rights and require planning applications for such changes of use.

3. These proposals will mean that any change of use between dwelling houses and small HMOs will be able to happen without planning permission unless the local council believes there is problem with such development in a particular area. In these areas they will be able to use article 4 powers to require planning permission.

4. Consultation with interested partners on this issue will ensure that the new rules work effectively for local people without placing an unnecessary burden on landlords and local planning authorities.

5. The proposals are part of wider reform to the planning system so that it moves away from the current top-down approach and create a system which encourages local people to take responsibility for shaping their communities, and gives power to councils to make this happen.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2088812,Setting the benchmark for transparency in social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today (14 February 2012) praised the latest social landlord to open its books and become more transparent to tenants.

The Minister said Viridian's plans to publish all expenditure over £500 from April this year would not only make them more accountable to their tenants, but would also help them increase efficiency.

Mr Shapps used the announcement to call on other housing associations to follow the example of Viridian and Home Group.

Since becoming Housing Minister, Mr Shapps has consistently challenged all social landlords to match his Department's commitment on transparency.

The Coalition believes that all organisations in receipt of public money can achieve better value for money when they ensure that transactions are open to real scrutiny. 

Mr Shapps said social landlords would be left behind if they failed to acknowledge the growing demands of tenants to see how their rent is being spent and that it was time to meet those expectations.  
  
Over the next few months officials from the Department for Communities and Local Government will hold a series of discussions with individual housing associations to discuss how they can become more transparent in the way they run their business.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said: 

> ""Housing associations have a long and distinguished track record of providing the affordable homes that millions of tenants rely on. But with more pressure on the public purse than ever, all organisations that receive money from the taxpayer should expect to come under greater scrutiny. It should feel entirely natural to be willing to explain their financial decisions.  
   
""So I'm delighted that Viridian, like Home Group before them, has taken this key decision to become more transparent for their tenants. Nowadays transparency is not just a nice-to-have add-on, it's vital for driving down costs and ensuring more is achieved with every taxpayers' pound. Large amounts of public money have been invested in social housing - so tenants and the public now deserve to know if their money is being well spent.""

Ministers have been alarmed that the sector has been too slow to respond to the public demand for openness and believe bringing housing associations under the Freedom of Information Act could make it easier for tenants and the public to find out more about how their landlords work.

The Government has committed to consult with social landlords on whether to extend the scope of the Act to include housing associations.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2109379,Stalled building sites to get funding boost,"Over 200 stalled building projects will receive a share of a multi-million pound pot to get Britain building again, Housing Minister Grant Shapps announced today.

The news came as the Prime Minister announced an extra £150 million for the Get Britain Building fund - taking the total to £570 million, paving the way for up to 16,000 new homes and supporting over 30,000 construction jobs and more in supply chains.

The Get Britain Building investment fund will get development finance directly to building firms. Funding will be provided through recoverable investments, with the majority being commercial loans, ensuring that money will be returned to be re-invested in other priorities.

The fund was three times over-subscribed and the Homes and Communities Agency today has shortlisted the strongest bids from nearly 400, based on value for money, how quickly they will be delivered and the level of local support. The list includes:

  * Marine Wharf, Lewisham - includes plans for 189 new homes
  * Marmaville, Kirklees - includes plans for 65 homes
  * Bromford Lane, Birmingham - includes plans for 42 homes
  * Royal Mills Phase 2, Ancoats, Manchester - includes plans for 128 homes
  * Finzels Reach, Bristol - includes plans for 204 homes

#### Big and small developers to benefit

The successful bids, which include a high proportion of developments by smaller and medium sized builders, will now be thoroughly assessed through due diligence before funding is allocated and formal contracts can be signed.

The £570 million fund is being targeted at commercially viable, shovel-ready sites with planning permission already in place to get them building again as soon as possible.

Ministers have already announced a shortlist of 18 difficult stalled sites for a share of the first £45 million of this funding to get them back on track and build 1,300 homes, which will help breathe life back into communities across the country. Some of these key projects are already on track to start building from April 2012.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Housebuilding is absolutely vital for delivering more growth in the economy, yet hundreds of shovel-ready housing developments have been put on ice, because builders lack funds to get work going on site.
> 
> ""The £570 million Get Britain Building Fund will help end the deadlock by getting construction back on track for up to 16,000 homes across the country. Already some of our key sites are on track to get started next month, and many more of the 224 projects shortlisted today will be up and running from June, helping to cement our economic recovery.""

The announcement today is just one of the range of measures from the Housing Strategy that include:

  * A £4.5 billion Affordable Housing programme, set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 new homes over the next four years.

  * The NewBuy Guarantee - announced last week - which has the potential to enable up to 100,000 prospective and existing homeowners to buy their dream home.

  * Government plans to release by 2015 formerly used public land with the capacity for 100,000 new homes.

### Notes to editors

1. The Get Britain Building investment fund was launched in the Government's Housing Strategy on 21 November 2011 and a prospectus was launched in 22 December 2011, with the window for bids closing on 30 January 2012.

2. Details of the funding being announced today can be found at: [www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/get-britain-building](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/get-britain-building) (external link). The full list of short-listed projects will be published on the Homes and Communities Agency's website today.

3. Many housing projects across the country had been put on hold until they have better access to development finance. Under the Get Britain Building Fund, the Government will invest in developments to revive building and get the market moving. This will take the form of loans or equity investments.

4. The scheme will be run by the Homes and Communities Agency, England's national housing and regeneration agency. In London, the Homes and Communities Agency will be operating under delegation from the Greater London Authority.

5. The Homes and Communities Agency estimates that the short-listed projects could unlock up to 16,000 homes.

6. Projects short-listed through the competition will complete due diligence during the course of next month to maximise value for money for the taxpayer. If not all the short-listed projects successfully complete this process, Ministers will look to award funding to other stalled projects.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1964353,Struggling homeowners have more options the quicker they act,"With figures out today showing some households are continuing to struggle to pay their mortgage, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has urged anyone who thinks that they may be at risk of losing their home to take action immediately.

New figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders released today show that the level of repossessions is unchanged. The number of properties taken into possession in the second quarter of 2011 was 9,000 across the UK, slightly fewer than the 9,100 in the previous quarter.

Mr Shapps called on struggling homeowners not to bury their heads in the sand but to see their mortgage as a priority and seek early help if they are at risk of repossession. He said that help was available, and so losing your home should only ever be the very last resort.

As the Council of Mortgage Lenders left their forecast on the numbers of repossessions this year unchanged at 40,000, Mr Shapps said that the single biggest impact that Government could have was through the ongoing efforts to tackle the record deficit and promote economic growth. He said this would help to prevent rapid increases in interest rates and protect more borrowers from the threat of repossession.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""With today's figures underlining how the worst recession for a generation has brought difficult times for Britain's homeowners, my message to those homeowners is clear: the quicker you act, the more options you have to stay in your home. The Government is meanwhile getting on with the task of tackling the record deficit we inherited - to avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates and keep the pressure off already stretched family budgets. I would also urge struggling households themselves to take immediate action to stay in their homes.
> 
> ""The worst thing anyone struggling to pay their mortgage can do is bury their heads in the sand hoping the problem will go away. No one in financial difficulty should be embarrassed to seek help if they need it. Anyone with money worries should seek early advice by speaking to their lender, Citizens Advice, Shelter, the National Debtline or by visiting the Directgov Mortgage Help website [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external website) and get free support, including a personal action plan to get out of debt.
> 
> ""Or of course, by speaking to their local council, who are able to offer support and advice to those worried about losing their home.""

The Government has also invested over £200 million for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme over the next two years to help the most vulnerable families facing repossession. The scheme is available through local authorities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2046826,Struggling households should seek support,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today called on any households faced with the threat of homelessness this Christmas to seek help and advice as soon as they can.

The Minister said that this country has one of the strongest safety nets in the world for families with children and vulnerable people as local councils are required to keep a roof over their heads, and highlighted the wide range of support available to those struggling to stay in their homes.

New figures today showed that 12,510 people were accepted as owed a main homelessness duty in the third quarter of the year - a rise of 6 per cent since the same period in 2010.

The Government is committed to tackling homelessness and protecting the most vulnerable. The £6.5 billion Supporting People budget has been protected to ensure support is there for those who need it most, and more than £400 million has been invested in homelessness prevention over the next four years. More than £42 million has also been invested to improve rough sleeper accommodation, and £20 million to help ensure that no-one spends a second night out on the street across the country.

Mr Shapps said anyone needing advice should speak to their councils who can provide help such as:

  * providing budget and rent advice for households having problems paying the rent and at risk of losing their home
  * helping find out if households are eligible for benefits to help with housing costs; and
  * speaking to the landlord on behalf of those at risk of eviction, or offering a rent bond to help them find alternative private rented accommodation.

Help is also available through independent charities such as Shelter, the National Debtline or Citizens Advice Bureau, who could provide advice and help with managing finances, or mortgage lenders, who may be able to make repayments more affordable.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's easy to feel alone in the face of financial difficulty but there is help available. Every council has a legal duty to ensure that eligible homeless households are not 'roofless', and can provide reams of free advice and information to prevent homelessness in the first place.
> 
> ""That's why I would urge anyone facing the threat of being homeless this Christmas to seek help. My message is clear - the quicker you act, the quicker we can help.
> 
> ""Statutory homelessness remains lower than in 28 of the last 30 years, and I am determined that we pull out all the stops to ensure every household knows that help is at hand.""

### Notes to editors

1. Anyone struggling with their mortgage can go to the Directgov Mortgage Help website at [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) for advice on getting their finances back on track.

3. Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 places a duty on local housing authorities to secure suitable accommodation for any person who is eligible for assistance, homeless through no fault of their own and within a 'priority need' group. The priority need groups include (among others) pregnant women, people with whom a dependant child resides and people who are vulnerable as a result of old age or mental illness. It provides a consistent, national statutory framework for the provision of homelessness assistance across England.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1922292,Support for tenants to improve their neighbourhoods,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today launched plans to give tenants greater support to hold their landlords to account.

The Minister argued that new locally-run tenant panels will put power back into the hands of residents, helping them to build the Big Society in their neighbourhoods.

Mr Shapps announced plans for an £535,000 residential training programme, to give tenants the confidence and skills they need to sit on tenant panels so they can represent their neighbours and resolve local disputes such as making sure repairs are made efficiently, and that complaints against anti-social behaviour are dealt with quickly.

He launched a mini-competition for charities and benevolent societies to bid to offer the training needed. The funding is expected to deliver:

  * at least 1,500 social tenants trained to sit on tenant panels
  * eight different training courses covering a range of subjects - including tenant panels, influencing landlords, and sharing information and learning; and
  * opportunities for interested tenants to work towards accredited qualifications, which could help them onto new career paths.

This training comes on top of plans for tenants to benefit from support and help from their landlords, who will be expected to work with them to set up tenant panels, and make a wide variety of information available so their performance can be properly scrutinised and assessed.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Social tenants know when things are going wrong with their neighbourhoods. They should be able to expect local solutions to local problems, and not have to wait for a remote organisation from Whitehall to take over.
> 
> ""I want as many tenants as possible to sit on tenant panels, so they have control over their own homes and their own lives and can use their local knowledge to improve their area. But I don't want them to feel isolated and unsupported - I want them to have the training and help they need to really make a difference.
> 
> ""That's why I am calling on charities and benevolent societies to step forward and help to deliver this £535,000 residential training programme, which will strengthen the arm of tenants to hold their landlords properly to account - and become true examples of the Big Society in action.""

The Government's champion for Active Safer Communities, Baroness Newlove said:

> ""I've seen willing and able individuals up and down the country wanting to be actively involved in tackling the problems of their communities and improving their quality of life, but not knowing quite how to do it.
> 
> ""For too long they have been passengers, reliant on others, when we need to place them right there in the driving seat, helping to make decisions about the services and issues that concern and affect them the most, such as anti-social behaviour.
> 
> ""Too often, good ideas from ordinary people are lost, so this is a fantastic opportunity to give tenants the confidence and the skills they need to make a real difference, influencing the decision makers and getting knowledge out to communities.
> 
> ""By building a base of knowledgeable people in neighbourhoods who can share and mentor others we will help create that web of active communities that forms the foundations of the Big Society.""

### Notes for editors

1. Applications are being sought from charities, benevolent societies and philanthropic institutions, as defined by the Charities Act 2006, for grant funding to deliver residential training to tenants living in social housing.

2. Residential training provides tenants with the skills, confidence and inspiration to play a more active role in their local community. It can inspire participants to lead change in their local community, including holding landlords to account through tenant panels and other scrutiny mechanisms.

3. Grant funding of up to £535,000 will be made available from the £8 million Tenant Empowerment Programme, announced in February 2011. This funding is intended to support activities over and above those that landlords should provide as part of their regulatory responsibilities. Funding for residential tenant training is currently provided to the National Communities Resource Centre.

4. The importance of developing local solutions to tackle tenants' problems, including an enhanced role for tenant panels, was identified in the Government's Review of Social Housing Regulation: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulation).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2137643,Surge of interest in national home swap scheme,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today hailed the national home swap scheme, _HomeSwap Direct_, as inquiries via the new scheme passed the million mark.

Since its launch in October 2011, over a million searches for properties have been made through _HomeSwap Direct_. The new scheme allows social housing tenants wanting to swap their home to see, for the first time, every available property in the country.

Mr Shapps said the surge of interest from tenants testified to a dramatic improvement since the failure of the centrally-prescribed MoveUK service. Started in 2004, within two years the number of moves had collapsed by half, and there was no clear strategy to improve the situation.

Now with over 5,500 searches a day, it is clear the greater choice offered through _HomeSwap Direct_ is proving popular with tenants who want to move house, whether to be closer to a new job or their family, or to find a property that better suits their needs.

Until now tenants have been restricted to swapping properties with other tenants in a scheme chosen by their landlord - effectively meaning only a partial swap scheme existed, and often an uphill battle for tenants if they wanted to move anywhere other than the neighbourhood where they already lived. _HomeSwap Direct_ is now giving tenants access to a much wider selection of properties than ever before and boosting their prospects of moving.

The scheme is online, so advertised swaps are much more accessible for tenants and the possibility of moving house is 'just a click away'.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's plain wrong that social tenants are barred from the same life opportunities as everyone else. Social housing is supposed to be a springboard to success - but under the old system tenants who wanted to make a longer-distance move had no realistic opportunity of ever swapping their home.
> 
> ""It's just one example of the lazy consensus that condemned social tenants to be trapped in homes that didn't meet their needs, and blocked their path to aspiration.
> 
> ""So I'm delighted that _HomeSwap Direct_ is at last giving tenants the opportunities they deserve. Instead of being pushed to the back of the queue, tenants now have more power to arrange their own home swaps and the chance to move anywhere in the country, whether to be closer to a new job or their family, or to find a property that better suits their needs.
> 
> ""There are some who have criticised the scheme, who'd rather see tenants stay put and make do. But the surge of interest by social tenants has confounded the critics, and proved they are no longer prepared to accept the old way of doing things.""

### Notes to editors

_HomeSwap Direct_ brings together four internet-based providers of mutual exchange services (HomeSwapper, House Exchange, Abritas and LHS (Locata)) to offer tenants more choice over where they live.

A membership agreement which has been developed by Government and joined by these providers is available on the Department for Communities and Local Government website. This sets out the framework under which information will be shared by providers, the technical requirements of the scheme and the processes by which new members can apply to join. A copy can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/2016632.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/2016632.pdf).

A new Tenancy Standard came into force on 1 April 2012 and places a requirement on social landlords in England to subscribe to an internet-based mutual exchange service. The provider of the service must be a signatory to an agreement such as _HomeSwap Direct_ under which tenants can access matches across all (or the greatest practicable number of) internet based mutual exchange services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1959066,Swifter justice for victims of 'neighbours from hell',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced plans to speed up the process for evicting persistent 'neighbours from hell' from their homes when all other efforts to curb their anti-social behaviour have failed.

He will propose to introduce a new mandatory power for possession, which will speed up the possession process by allowing previous convictions for serious anti-social behaviour to trigger eviction proceedings and short-cut the often long and expensive process which often requires landlords to prove again the 'yobbish' actions of their nightmare tenants.

Trigger offences are likely to include:

  * a conviction for a serious housing-related offence - including violence against neighbours, drug dealing and criminal damage
  * breach of an injunction for anti-social behaviour - where the social landlord has obtained, or is party to, the injunction; and
  * closure of a premises under a closure order - for example where a property has been used for drug dealing.

The Minister made clear that eviction should only ever be the last resort - but that too often the rights of victims have come second to those of the people making their lives a misery.

It is estimated that the Courts make 3,000 eviction orders for anti-social behaviour against social tenants each year. Most of the others are resolved through other support or enforcement measures such as mediation, acceptable behaviour agreements, Family Intervention Projects or injunctions.

But where landlords reach the last resort of eviction, survey data indicates that it takes on average seven months from applying for a possession order to being granted one. And with some defendants deciding to not turn up or cases being adjourned several times, it can sometimes take much longer.

The costs to landlords, and by extension their tenants, of evicting a 'neighbour from hell' can be well over £20,000 in complex cases.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""All too often, efforts to tackle neighbours from hell take far too long, and it seems the needs and right of the victims play second fiddle to those of the perpetrators.
> 
> ""That's why I'm looking to speed up the process, so where a social housing tenant already has a conviction for anti-social behaviour and the situation has not improved this can be taken into account and landlords can act swiftly to bring an end to the day-to-day misery that is inflicted for too long on those simply seeking to quietly enjoy their homes.
> 
> ""Of course eviction is a drastic step and should be the last resort that landlords take to tackle this menace - but when all other options have failed to stop this yobbish behaviour, victims should not have to wait months or even years to see justice done.""

Baroness Newlove, victims campaigner and the Government's Champion for Active Safer Communities, welcomed this new announcement, which she argued demonstrates clearly that the Government is on the side of victims not offenders.

She said:

> ""My postbag is filled with heartbreaking stories of law-abiding families whose lives are made a living hell by the actions of a few uncaring, selfish individuals whose thoughtlessness or ruthless criminal actions blight and intimidate whole neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""These victims of anti-social behaviour live in abject misery begging in vain for help from one agency or another and sometimes spend years, powerless to do anything about it. If they are owner occupiers they cannot sell their homes and move, such is the trap they are in. This has got to stop.
> 
> ""This action will go a long way to redress the balance in their favour.
> 
> ""We must empower social landlords to back the quiet suffering majority and deal swiftly with the criminal minority. I shall ensure my work gives maximum exposure so any citizen finding themselves in the same situation living next door to the neighbour from hell will have the knowledge and tools to finally see swift redress. Perhaps the very real threat of losing their home may bring to heel those who deny the right of a peaceful life to others.""

Baroness Browning, Minister for Crime Prevention and Antisocial Behaviour Reduction, said:

> ""I welcome these proposals. They build on those outlined in our recent 'More Effective Responses to Anti-social Behaviour' consultation and support the cross-government action on tackling anti-social behaviour, which is a key priority for us.
> 
> ""Our aim is to ensure that, in future, where a community or victim is suffering anti-social behaviour - particularly the sort of targeted, persistent harassment apparent in a number of high-profile recent cases - the police and other local agencies take the problem seriously, deal with it swiftly, and protect vulnerable victims.""

### Notes to editors

1. Today's consultation, _A new mandatory power of possession for anti-social behaviour_, has been published today and can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/antisocialbehaviourconsult). The deadline for responses is 5pm on Thursday 27 October.

2. Examples of recent eviction cases include:

#### Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association

Two tenants of Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association carried out an extensive campaign of anti-social behaviour targeting their neighbour's family for many years. This included excessive noise, which was witnessed by relevant officers and the police.

As a result of the seriousness of the anti-social behaviour and the impact on the neighbour's young family, a Premises Closure Order was granted on their property in September 2009 - one of the first where drugs were not an issue. The order was later extended but the tenant appealed against the order. The appeal was finally dismissed by the Court of Appeal in October 2010.

In the meantime, the landlord had filed for possession order in the court on 27 October 2009. A directions hearing was held in January 2010 and a trial date was set for 19 November 2010. Pending the determination of the appeal against the closure order and the outcome of the possession case, the landlord took out an injunction excluding the tenants from the property in March 2010.

A possession order was granted on 7 April 2011, 18 months after the process began. Despite the evidence being proven to a criminal standard through to the High Court for the closure order, the landlord had to prove the case all over again for the possession order, putting the witnesses through another trial. Now the tenants have appealed against the possession granted. The total cost of the whole process so far to the landlord has been in excess of £38,000.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2108495,Tackling neighbours from hell,"A new tool for communities

Communities will now have a new way to combat the neighbours from hell who ruin neighbourhoods and cause misery for fellow tenants, Housing Minister Grant Shapps announced today.

### Landlord-led approach

For the first time, social landlords will be able to present their evidence in court through a new type of statement, which clearly sets out the harmful impact of anti-social behaviour on the community.

Mr Shapps said the new court statements will help landlords end the agony of tenants who have suffered cruel and nasty behaviour from neighbours, and have endured living alongside the perpetrators for months or even years before they can be evicted.

Today's move will help landlords present a stronger case in court by enabling them to exhibit the impact of anti-social behaviour on the entire community, not just individuals. It comes ahead of new measures to tackle anti-social behaviour and strengthen the hand of landlords that will soon be announced by the Government.

### Successful pilots completed

Over the last six months the new tool, developed by the sector with Government funding, has been piloted by 11 landlords across the country, and has already proved successful in 21 court cases where it has been vital in assessing the harmful impact of anti-social behaviour.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For years too many social tenants have lived in fear of anti-social behaviour, with the added insult that these neighbours from hell are getting away with it. They've been forced to live alongside their tormentors, while action to evict the perpetrators gets endlessly bogged down in court.
> 
> ""So I'm delighted to announce today that, with the help of funding from the Government, the sector has been able to develop a new tool that will help them show the courts how this behaviour by a nasty and vicious minority can impact the lives of the entire community.
> 
> ""These new statements have already proved their mettle in court, with landlords confident that judges are taking them seriously. So I would encourage all landlords to make these statements part of their toolkit for tackling anti-social behaviour, and reclaim the streets from the disruptive thugs who think they can make everyone else's lives a misery.""

The new court statements have been developed following close cooperation between social landlords and the Anti-Social Behaviour Action Team, which is based at the Chartered Institute of Housing and funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

### Notes to editors

1. The new statements have already been used by 11 pilot landlords in 21 cases court cases. They provide a summary of evidence that can help barristers answer judges' questions about complex cases, and the harmful impact on the community and local resources.

2. The pilot organisations included in the trials were: Community Gateway Association, Gloucester City Homes, Helena Partnerships, Kettering Borough Council, Solihull Community Housing, South Essex Homes/SMAART, Sovereign, Stockport Homes, Taunton Deane Borough Council, TOR Homes, Viridian Housing.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2142678,Tackling record deficit has helped keep repossessions down,"The Government's commitment to tackling the record deficit is keeping interest rates at a record low and a secure roof over the heads of millions of hard-working homeowners, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.

The Minister spoke as latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed the number of repossessions unchanged from the same quarter last year. Today's figures show there were 9,600 repossessions during the first three months of 2012 - unchanged from the same quarter of 2011.

Mr Shapps said today's figures underlined how Government action was helping to head off the threat of far higher rates of home repossessions predicted by a leading academic three years ago.

In his report Professor John Muellbauer of Nuffield College, Oxford warned that at the extreme, repossessions could hit levels last seen in the 1990s - and even in more likely scenarios could hit as many as 60,000 a year.

But the Minister also stressed that while today's figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders were below these earlier predictions, there was no room for complacency and that the Government is determined to do all it can to prevent the trauma of repossession for hard-pressed households.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""No family that has worked hard to buy their own home should be left feeling like repossession is the only option - not when there is help and support on offer to ensure that it is only ever the last resort.
> 
> ""Thanks to our work to tackle the deficit, we've managed to keep interest rates at record lows, keeping pressure off hardworking homeowners, and meaning we're nowhere near the levels predicted only three years ago.
> 
> ""Even though figures today show that repossession levels are stable, now is not the time to rest on our laurels. Just as the Government is tackling the problem head on I would urge struggling homeowners to do the same - I would urge them to take action and take charge, get advice early and use the support on offer.""

Mr Shapps said that, just as he is committed to helping people onto the property ladder, he is also determined that for those who already own their own homes, real help and advice is on hand to keep people in their hard earned homes and ensure repossession remains a last resort.

This help includes:

  * A £20 million Preventing Repossession fund giving every council the opportunity to offer small interest free loans to struggling homeowners and ensure that court desks can offer on the day advice for those facing the prospect of repossession.

  * The Directgov website - [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link) - which has lots of free advice and information. Helpful advice is also on hand from organisations including Citizens Advice and the National Debtline; and

  * The Mortgage Rescue Scheme, which has been refocused to deliver better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to housing associations and tighter caps on property prices and repair costs, to ensure as many people as possible can benefit from it. More than £200 million has been invested into the scheme, and is now available through councils and housing associations to ensure help is targeted at homeowners most likely to benefit from it.

### Notes to editors

1. The Council of Mortgage Lenders publish their repossessions figures today, which can be found at: [www.cml.org.uk/cml/media/press/3203](http://www.cml.org.uk/cml/media/press/3203) (external link).

2. Separate figures from the Ministry of Justice show that claims leading to a court order have fallen over the past three months by three per cent, and by 12 per cent compared with the same quarter of 2011. The total number of claims for mortgage possession by lenders between January and March this year were five per cent lower than the previous quarter, and 15 per cent lower than in the same quarter in 2011. Of the mortgage possession claims that led to orders in the first quarter of 2012, 50 per cent were suspended. These figures can be found at: [www.justice.gov.uk/statistics/civil-justice/mortgage-possession](http://www.justice.gov.uk/statistics/civil-justice/mortgage-possession) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1975025,Tenants to be trained to take control of their neighbourhoods post-riots,"In a move designed to strengthen tenants' say in the running of their local communities after the shocking scenes of rioting earlier this month, Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced new training to give them the skills for running local 'tenant panels'.

Mr Shapps said that the recent riots showed that when communities come together to take a stand against those inflicting damage and disorder, they can have a real impact; the new training and creation of tenant panels would put powers back into the hands of tenants and give them a greater say on the running of their local community.

And he highlighted how more people came out to clean up after the riots than participated in the riots themselves.

He said that nobody knows their neighbourhoods better than tenants themselves and giving them real power to take control of local housing, could lead to services being better shaped around individual and local needs, benefiting everyone.

New powers in the Localism Bill propose to give tenants the opportunity to lead their local communities and be given a direct say on how the issues that matter most to local people - such as repairs, anti social behaviour and estate management - can be better tackled, by enabling tenant panels to consider complaints before referring them to the ombudsman.

So today, he announced that a registered charity The National Communities Resource Centre at Trafford Hall has been awarded £535,000 to deliver training and support to empower tenants to set up groups to lead on the management of their social housing. The training will focus on developing their skills and confidence to take positive local action to tackle problems that arise in their area. It is expected to deliver:

  * at least 1,500 social tenants trained to sit on tenant panels
  * at least eight different training courses covering a range of subjects - including sitting on tenant panels, influencing landlords, and sharing information and learning
  * seed grants for up to 100 tenants to help them spread learning in their community and kick start local initiatives; and
  * opportunities for interested tenants to work towards accredited qualifications, which could help them onto new career paths.

Mr Shapps said that the training would also help develop the skills and confidence of those who attend, putting real emphasis on social housing as a springboard to help people make better lives for themselves and their communities.

The Minister said that the training would complement the great strides that Government was taking to give new power and opportunities to social tenants:

  * Tenant Cashback - allowing social tenants to take control of the repairs budgets for their homes
  * Right to Manage - allowing tenants to take over responsibility for the management of their homes and estates; and
  * National Home Swap Scheme which will make it easier for tenants who want to move, to exchange properties across the country.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We saw during the recent riots that when communities come together to take a stand against those causing deliberate damage, real action results. In fact, more people came out to clean up after the riots than participated in that appalling behaviour. Residents, including social housing tenants, want to make big positive differences to their communities - and I want to put the powers in their hands to be able to do so.
> 
> ""For too long, when there's a problem in their area, they have been told to sit tight and wait until action is taken on their behalf. The new powers and skills that tenant panels will bring will instead allow them to take control of their area; putting them at the heart of proposing solutions, and no longer simply putting up with the problems.
> 
> ""I want as many tenants as possible to sit on tenant panels, using their local knowledge to improve their area, and this training will allow them to do so - feeling capable and confident of taking on the challenge, and making a real difference.""

Sally Wyatt, Chief Executive Trafford Hall, said:

> ""The National Communities Resource Centre is committed to helping tenants play a lead role in the decisions that affect their communities and we are delighted at this news. The funding will allow us to offer many more tenants the opportunity to get the training and support they need to tackle some of problems that plague their communities and make a real difference at local level.""

### Notes to editors:

1. In June 2011, applications were invited from charities, benevolent societies and philanthropic institutions, as defined by the Charities Act 2006, for grant funding to deliver residential training to tenants living in social housing.

2. 22 applications were received and evaluated against criteria such as understanding of the aims and objectives, evidence of ability to deliver a national programme, experience and value for money.

3. Grant funding of up to £535,000 will be made available from the £8 million Tenant Empowerment Programme, announced in February 2011. This funding is intended to support activities over and above those that landlords should provide as part of their regulatory responsibilities.

4. The National Communities Resource Centre is a registered charity offering training and support to develop the skills, confidence and capacity of those living and working in low-income areas, to tackle housing-related problems and reverse poor conditions. It was set up in 1991 by Professor Brian Able-Smith, Lord Rogers of Riverside and Professor Anne Power with the aim of providing training and small seed funding grants to community groups to enable them to have a practical and positive impact on their local community.

5. Case studies of training provided at Trafford Hall include:

**Beacon Hill Tenants and Residents Association (Sedgley, West Midlands)**

  * Following an anti-social behaviour course, the group, in discussions with the police and other local groups applied for a small grant of £100 so that they could contribute to the cost of alcohol restriction zone signs that would enable the police to legally enforce the ban in the designated area.

  * Where the alcohol ban has been enforced there has been a reduction in street drinking and most significantly underage drinking. The police have reported a reduction in alcohol related anti social behaviour and there is a feeling that it has helped change for the better the profile of the area.

**Brickwell Estate Residents Group (Hull)**

  * The local Area Housing Board members attended a training course to give them the skills and knowledge to provide an effective housing service. The course covered responsibilities of Board Members, effective committee skills, budgeting and forward planning.
  * Following the training Board Members have been able to transfer this learning into their own localities. All those involved will now have better skills and confidence to contribute effectively and make full use of the opportunity that the meetings provide to help improve their local areas.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1842960,Grant Shapps outlines 'the most radical reforms to social housing for a generation',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has called on housing associations, housebuilders and developers to take advantage of a new scheme to build more affordable homes.

Mr Shapps said the Affordable Rent programme will allow landlords to offer homes to new tenants at up to 80 per cent of local market rate, with the extra revenue to be invested in new homes.

The Housing minister also confirmed that over the next four years the government will also be investing £4.5billion that will deliver up to 150,000 new affordable homes.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""With some 4.5 million people on social housing waiting lists, it's clear that not only do we need more homes, but we also need a complete overhaul of the system, to one that offers much more flexibility than the current 'one size fits all' approach.
> 
> ""The new Affordable Rent scheme launched today ticks both boxes. It offers landlords the freedom they need to offer a range of solutions to people's housing needs, while being able to raise extra rents to invest in house-building.
> 
> ""This new scheme will provide new affordable homes which could help some of the millions of families currently on housing waiting lists, let down by a rigid, outdated system that is failing to meet their needs. But this scheme is also part of the most radical reforms to social housing for a generation, vital to ensuring that as many people as possible benefit from this valuable resource.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1860826,Think outside of 'identikit Legoland homes',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today called on architects and housebuilders to ""think outside the identikit Legoland box"" and make sure their new developments reflect the identity of the local area.

The minister has written to the Design Council - which recently merged activities on housing design with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment - encouraging them to help developers to work with local communities to bring forward creative and innovative designs that respond to local character and identity.  

He has asked the Design Council to work with communities to help them consider how they could use new neighbourhood plans to best support those developers whose designs and use of materials are more sensitive to the aesthetic of the local area without adding to the regulatory burden on the industry.

The Localism Bill currently before Parliament includes radical reforms to England's planning laws, enabling communities to come together to draw up neighbourhood plans to decide what their area should look like. If people vote in favour of these plans in local referendums, councils would have to adopt them.

In his letter to the Design Council, Mr Shapps argues that England's suburbs have been dominated by ""identikit"" homes that could be anywhere in the country and that instead, developers could look to take the character of the local neighbourhood more into account in their designs.

He points to examples of housing developments up and down the country that have used local materials and taken local views into account - giving the area a unique identity while at the same time providing the homes local people need. And by giving these new properties a local flavour, the developers have helped support jobs in the area - and in some cases created new tourist attractions.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""We all recognise the bog standard, identikit Legoland homes that typify some new developments - all looking exactly the same on streets that could be anywhere in the country. Whilst we are seeing good examples emerging, too often new developments are dominated by the same, identikit designs that bear no resemblance to the character of the local area.
> 
> ""I want more developers to think outside these Legoland designs and consider how the expertise, knowledge and materials that are locally available could be best used to reflect the identity of their surrounding neighbourhood.
> 
> ""But power also rests in the hands of the residents. Neighbourhood plans, designed and voted on by communities themselves, could offer vital support to those architects and developers who are more sensitive to the look and feel of the place in which they are building.""

Planning and Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Banal, identikit housing schemes have given development a bad name. Experience here and overseas shows that when local people have the chance to influence the function and appearance of developments, opposition can be turned into enthusiasm and buildings are constructed that we can be proud of. 
> 
> ""Neighbourhood planning will give people the chance to exercise meaningful choice over the look and feel of the places where they live - from the location of new homes, shops and offices, to the choice of materials used. That way, developers who work with local people are likely to benefit from a smoother process for obtaining planning permission.""

Exemplar developments that have been built to reflect local character and in some cases have used local materials include:

**Abbess Roding, Essex:** A recently completed Hastoe Housing Association development provides six affordable rural homes for local people. It is the culmination of over five years of partnership work, from recording local housing need, to finding a suitable site and consulting with the community about the layout and design before a planning application was made. The project was fully supported by the Parish Council. The homes help local families, who would otherwise be priced out of the area and forced to move away, to stay in the place where they have strong roots. Through continued and positive community consultation, the homes achieved a design that complements the village character through the use of brick, render and clay plain tiles where colours were chosen by the Parish Council.

**Rostron Brow, Stockport:** Developed by architects TADW for the Northern Counties Housing Association, the development forms part of a ten year plan to improve the Hillgate Conservation Area. In building the homes, the developers reused existing brick, stone and slate as well as existing redundant timber beams and stone features. In redeveloping the area, the priority was a reconstruction of the area - everything from window details, shop fronts and building facades have been designed to replicate in detail area from historic photographs and original sections of the area

**The Russells, Broadway, Worcestershire:** Built on the site of a former furniture factory, this is a mixed use development of 77 homes. The neighbourhood also includes a supermarket and a museum. Once the planning application was submitted, a long consultation process was held involving local residents and English Heritage, giving the opportunity to make changes to the design. The result is a housing development that fits in with the surrounding 16th century Broadway village buildings, built using locally-sourced Cotswold sandstone.

**Chapelfield, Orford, Suffolk:** A housebuilder with planning permission to build six new homes was encouraged by a local estate agent to employ an architect living in Orford village to design them. The architect used his knowledge of the local area and local building forms to produce plans for the development which fit into the overall village design.

**Port Sunlight, Wirral, Merseyside:** Port Sunlight became a conservation area in 1977 and nearly every building in the village is Grade II listed - making it one of the principal tourist attractions in the area. Each cottage is built using traditional Cheshire red brick. The Port Sunlight Village Trust was established in April 1999 to preserve and maintain the character, landscape and buildings within the area.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1637698,Time to stop the councillor pay hikes at time of public pay freeze,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has hit out at recommendations by the Local Government Association for hikes to councillor allowances at a time when public sector workers - including town hall staff - are facing a two-year pay freeze.

The new Government is pledging greater openness and transparency on councillor allowances.

### Councillor allowance hikes at time of pay freeze

In a circular on 23 June, the Local Government Association (LGA) issued recommendations on 'members allowances'. It recommended a rise of 2.3 per cent this year; it also said that councillors attending the LGA should be paid 'a daily rate' of £152.77. Another circular published the same day from the LGA advised of a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers. Most councils have already adopted a pay freeze this year. Local councillor allowances are a matter for local councils, and Ministers have no legal powers to intervene. But Ministers are calling on councillors to freeze their allowances in line with public sector workers.

### Need for 'sunlight' of openness

There is no central list of councillor allowances. The LGA is not subject to the FOI regime. The new Government is pledging to require councils to publish allowances in an open and standardised format online, allowing for voluntary groups like theyworkforyou.com to 'mash up' the data and publish allowances, councillor by councillor, in one place.

Grant Shapps, Minister for Local Government, said:

> ""It is not justifiable for hikes in councillor allowances when public sector workers are facing a two-year pay freeze. We're all in this together, and those who hold public office need to lead by example.
> 
> ""In an era of localism, councillors will have an increasingly important role to play in holding town halls to account on behalf of their residents. But councillors must remain arms-length volunteers. It will be harmful for local democracy if they become the bankrolled staff of the town hall dependant on the municipal pay packet.
> 
> ""The new Government will let the sunlight of openness into councillor allowances to allow the press and public to hold elected officials to account more. We all need to do our bit to restore the public finances to good health and ensure taxpayers get better value for money.""

### Further information

1. On 23 June, in a circular to council chief executives, the LGA recommended councillor allowances be increased by 2.3 per cent - despite a pay freeze for public sector workers, including a pay freeze for most council workers already in effect this year.

'Members Allowances: As a service to member authorities, the LGA each year circulates a revised member allowances daily rate, derived from the latest Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings. The increase for 2009 was 2.3 per cent, which when applied to the present daily rate of £149.34 gives a daily rate of £152.77' (LGA, LG alert checklist, 23/10, 23 June 2010). [http://new.lga.gov.uk/lga/core/page.do?pageId=12031198](http://new.lga.gov.uk/lga/core/page.do?pageId=12031198) (external link).

This came on the same day further guidance from the LGA informed councils of the recommendation for a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers. Most councils have already adopted a pay freeze in 2010-11 (Local Government Employers, Budget Statement on public sector pay, 23 June 2010). [http://www.lge.gov.uk/lge/aio/6516727](http://www.lge.gov.uk/lge/aio/6516727) (external link).

This is on top of a recommended 4.6 per cent rise last year - the first year of the council pay freeze.

2. Although councils must publish councillor allowances as a legal requirement under 1980s legislation, the new Government has pledged to publish councillor allowances in a more open way, to allow better comparison between councils and ensure greater public scrutiny.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2104147,Unlocking aspiration for a new generation of home buyers,"Details of two ambitious schemes that will unlock the aspirations of a new generation of home buyers, and get Britain building thousands of new homes, were unveiled today by the Prime Minister and Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

Mr Shapps declared the NewBuy Guarantee open for business - a scheme that will enable an estimated 100,000 prospective and existing homeowners to buy their dream home with much smaller deposits than currently required.

The increased demand for new homes will also give a boost to housebuilders and the economy, and see thousands of workers returning to building sites across the country.

At the same time, the Minister announced details of the reinvigorated Right to Buy, which will give up to two million social tenants the opportunity to buy their council home with a discount of up to £75,000 and, for the first time, ensure that additional properties sold are replaced with new affordable homes for rent.

### NewBuy Guarantee

From today three leading high street lenders and seven of the country's biggest building firms will begin to offer mortgages on newly-built properties to people with just a five per cent deposit; a financial product not available anywhere else in the market. Other leading names, including smaller housebuilders, are expected to follow their lead in the coming weeks and months.

Today's deals will mean that instead of a typical buyer requiring a £40,000 deposit for £200,000 property, they will now only need £10,000. The Government and housebuilders will help provide security for the loan, so if the house is then sold for less than the outstanding mortgage total the lender will be able to recover its loss.

The scheme, which has attracted strong support from many of the country's biggest house-builders and mortgage lenders, will offer help for up to 100,000 buyers who would otherwise be frozen out of the market.

The deals will include:  


  * Barclays who will offer 95 per cent Loan-to-Value mortgages on properties built by Barratt, Bellway, Bovis, Persimmon, Redrow and Taylor Wimpey at just 4.99 per cent fixed rate for two years and 5.89 per cent fixed rate for four years
  * Nationwide who will offer 95 per cent Loan-to-Value mortgages on properties built by Barratt, Bovis, Bellway, Persimmon, Redrow and Taylor Wimpey at just 5.69 per cent fixed rate for three years and 5.99 fixed rate for five years; and
  * NatWest who will offer 95 per cent Loan-to-Value mortgages on properties built by Barratt, Bellway, Bovis, Linden Homes, Persimmon, Redrow and Taylor Wimpey at just 4.29 per cent fixed rate for two years and 4.99 per cent fixed rate for five years.

In addition, Crest Nicholson will be joining the scheme imminently.

The NewBuy Guarantee will support an estimated 50,000 jobs in construction and related industries by increasing demand for newly-built homes.

The scheme will also help jumpstart the stalled housing market as people begin to move, ensuring more newly-built and older properties become available to buy.

### Right to Buy

Mr Shapps also published final details of a revamped Right to Buy, which will significantly increase the discounts for two million social tenants in England.  
  
For years, the discounts available under Right to Buy have steadily declined, putting the dream of buying a home out of reach for many tenants - fewer than 3,700 sales were made last year compared to a peak of 84,000 less than 10 years ago.  
  
Ministers have made a key commitment that everyone should have the chance to own their own home, so from April tenants could benefit from a discount of up to £75,000, more than quadrupling the discount cap in London and trebling it in most other parts of the country.  
  
Mr Shapps said the new Right to Buy would see no reduction in the number of affordable homes, with any additional homes bought under the scheme leading directly to the provision of new affordable homes for rent.  
  
Councils will be able to sign an agreement with the Government for using the receipts from sales to build new affordable homes in their area. The receipts will only need to meet 30 per cent of the costs, mirroring the highly successful funding model used for the Affordable Homes programme.  
  
Where receipts are not used locally they will be passed to the Greater London Authority and the Homes and Communities Agency, who will re-invest the money in new affordable housing across the country.

The Prime Minister said:

> ""Strong families and stable communities are built from good homes. That's why I want us to build more homes and I want more people to have the chance to own their own home.  
  
""We are acting today across the board to make this happen.
> 
> ""We're re-booting the right to buy scheme to increase discounts for two million tenants in social housing in England.
> 
> ""And we're delivering on our promise to offer affordable mortgages to buyers who might otherwise not be able to raise the money to buy a newly-built home.  
  
""It's no good hoping people will climb the property ladder if the bottom rung is missing. Affordable properties and available mortgages are vital.  
  
""So we're working with leading house builders and lenders to get the scheme underway.
> 
> ""It's a vital boost to the housing market, giving people good affordable new homes and backing thousands of jobs in construction in the process.  
  
""This government doesn't just talk about expanding home ownership: we're making it happen.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This Government inherited a housing market in disarray, with millions of hard working people blocked from taking their first step on the housing ladder - their desire to buy a home no longer a dream, but a distant fantasy.
> 
> ""We want to help everyone achieve their aspirations, and feel the pride of home ownership. So I'm delighted that from today the NewBuy Guarantee will give thousands of prospective buyers the chance to buy a home with a fraction of the deposit normally required.
> 
> ""We're also scrapping the miserly restrictions on the level of discounts under Right to Buy - great news for thousands of tenants who have done well for themselves and want to buy the home they live in.  
  
""But we are determined to maintain the number of affordable homes for rent - so for the first time, homes that are sold will be replaced by a new affordable homes, helping councils meet housing need and getting the nation building again.""

Home Builders Federation Executive Chairman Stewart Baseley said:

> ""NewBuy will help thousands of people to meet their aspirations to buy a new home, freeing up the housing market and helping first time buyers and those unable to take the next step on the ladder.
> 
> ""The scheme will also provide a vital kick-start for the house builders large and small who will be able to build the homes and create the jobs that the country desperately needs. The government deserves credit for backing NewBuy and enabling it to become a reality; it shows that housing is in its rightful place at the top of the political agenda.""

Council of Mortgage Lenders director general Paul Smee commented:

> ""We are delighted that three lenders are today launching mortgages under NewBuy, and that more are set to follow. These mortgages will help creditworthy borrowers who simply haven't yet managed to build up a large enough deposit to gain access to finance to buy a newly built home. NewBuy is good news for home-buyers, and potentially good news for jobs and the wider economy too. Borrowers need to understand the implications of high loan-to-value borrowing, so we are pleased to support the initiative with clear consumer information to help people decide whether NewBuy borrowing is an attractive option for them.""

### Notes to editors

#### NewBuy Guarantee Scheme

1. An estimated one million people, including 380,000 aspiring first time buyers, can afford mortgage repayments but are currently excluded from the housing market because they do not have a large enough deposit.

2. The NewBuy Guarantee Scheme is intended to boost housing supply and deliver a significant increase in access to affordable mortgages for those who can afford mortgage repayments but do not have large savings. Final details of the scheme were published today and can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/housing/homeownership/newbuy/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/homeownership/newbuy/).

3. A recent survey by Rightmove found that 28 per cent of first-time buyers feel they will be more likely to buy once the NewBuy scheme launches; and that 24 per cent of first-time sellers feel that they will be more likely to buy.

4. 28,000 homebuyers have registered their interest in NewBuy with builders.  
  
5. The Government has supported the Home Builders Federation and the Council of Mortgage Lenders in their development of the NewBuy scheme, which will be administered by Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc. All lenders and builders operating in England can now participate in the scheme, and will be responsible for forming their own commercial arrangements. More details can be found at: [www.hbf.co.uk](http://www.hbf.co.uk) (external link).

6. Home buyers can buy new build properties constructed by a participating builder using NewBuy. A leaflet for interested buyers can be found at: [www.cml.org.uk/cml/consumers/newbuy](http://www.cml.org.uk/cml/consumers/newbuy) (external link).

7. 130 builders have registered an interest in participating in NewBuy with the Home Builders Federation. Of these, 76 are not members of the Home Builders Federation and will be accessing the scheme on a level playing field.

8. More lenders are keenly interested in NewBuy and plan to participate over the coming weeks and months. Halifax is working with 16 builders and will be launching a range of products specifically designed for the scheme in April. Santander is in the final stages of agreeing partnerships with selected developers and will start to offer its first NewBuy mortgages via intermediaries with established ties to these housebuilders by the middle of the year.

9. Lenders will still assess potential borrowers according to the usual underwriting and risk criteria. However, because of reduced risk profiles, lenders will be able to lend at a higher loan to value ratio than usual, meaning that potential home buyers need a smaller deposit. The following eligibility criteria will also apply:

  * the price of the property must be less than £500,000

  * homes bought through NewBuy must be a standard purchase - not shared equity or shared ownership

  * the property being purchased must be the applicants' main home - not a second home or a buy to let investment

  * the applicants must be UK citizens, or have indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

10. Under the NewBuy scheme housebuilders will put 3.5 per cent of the sale price into an indemnity fund for each property sold, and the Government will provide additional security for the mortgage loan in the form of a 5.5 per cent guarantee. In the event of repossession, the lender will be able to recover any losses to the maximum covered by the borrower's deposit and the home builder's fund, and then call on the Government guarantee. If no claim is made builders can recover their contributions after seven years.

#### Right to Buy

12. Ministers have today published final details of the Right to Buy scheme, following a consultation. A copy can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/righttobuyresponses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/righttobuyresponses).

13. Most Right to Buy discounts are currently limited by caps. These range from £16,000 in most parts of London to £38,000 in parts of the South East (full details in table below). From April, subject to parliamentary approval, tenants could benefit from a discount of up to £75,000, more than quadrupling the discount cap in London and trebling it in most other parts of the country.

**Maximum Discount Limits under the current Right to Buy scheme**

  
14. Tenants must have been public sector tenants for five years before they can qualify to purchase their home through Right to Buy.  
  
15. The replacement of additional homes bought through Right to Buy will be funded using the same highly successful model as the Affordable Homes programme. Under this approach social landlords can meet the costs of new homes from borrowing against the future rental income, contributing from their own resources, including land, and grant funding from the Government. For the Right to Buy replacement scheme, receipts will substitute for grant funding for up to 30 per cent of total costs.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1784215,Waiting list figures show urgent need for housing reform,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has pointed to the latest numbers of families on waiting lists as further evidence of the need for fundamental reform of the system for allocating social homes.

New official statistics published today show there are 1.75 million households waiting to be allocated a council or housing association home - up 72 per cent over the past 13 years.

Commenting on these latest figures, Mr Shapps argued that councils must be given the flexibility they desperately need to better ease the housing pressures their communities face.

The figures come just a week after the Government published details of the most radical reforms to social housing for a generation, including:

  * giving social landlords the option of offering flexible tenancies - with decisions made locally
  * allowing councils to set their own rules about who qualifies to go on housing waiting lists
  * making it easier for any of the eight million social tenants in England to move when their circumstances change
  * more flexibility for councils to make decisions on how best to help people at risk of homelessness at the local level; and
  * allowing housing associations to offer a new affordable rent tenancy from April 2011.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today's figures underline the clear and pressing need to change the way social housing operates in this country. It is unacceptable that five million people are left languishing on waiting lists.
> 
> ""So the first thing we're going to do is build more homes using a new flexible rent approach. Next, councils and housing associations must have the flexibility they so desperately need to better tackle local housing pressures. That's why I have announced plans for the most far-reaching and radical reforms for a generation, from the option of fixed tenancies offering help for new tenants for as long as they need it, to extra help for existing tenants to move to a new social home.
> 
> ""Under these plans, landlords will be able to properly assess and meet the needs of both their new and existing tenants, and no longer struggle through the failed 'one size fits all' approach.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1616451,Grants Shapps taking action to address homelessness,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today chaired the first cross government meeting aimed at tackling homelessness.

The Prime Minister had tasked Ministers in eight government departments with stepping up action to address the issue. Today (Weds 16 June), the Ministers met for the first time as the Homelessness Working Group, to see how policies across their departments can help tackle the complex problems that cause people to lose their home.

At the same time Grant Shapps has announced that he plans to overhaul the way in which rough sleepers are counted, so that the findings better reflect the true scale of the problem. Any agreed changes will come into effect from 2011 and, as pre-announced, this year's rough sleeping figure will be published as soon as possible.

Up until 2008, the majority of the estimates that councils submitted were bracketed down to zero, masking the true number of rough sleepers nationwide. The current system also means that local authorities only have to conduct a count where there is thought to be a significant problem - meaning that only 76 out of the then 354 councils contributed to the last national count.

![Ministers meet to discuss action to tackle homelessness](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1616904.jpg)Ministers meet to discuss action to tackle homelessness

Mr Shapps said:

> ""Councils and charities are doing a great job in helping people off the streets, but the current counting system makes a mockery of the scale of the problem they face.
> 
> ""This Coalition Government will not stick our heads in the sand and ignore the true picture of the number of those facing life on the streets. That's why I am announcing today that we will overhaul the Rough Sleeping Count from 2011 so that it is a credible measure and reflects the reality of the situation.
> 
> ""And for the first time, Ministers from across eight Government departments are coming together to ensure that the needs of the homeless are being met, not just in terms of housing, but in employment, training, rehabilitation and healthcare.""

The Ministers making up the new Homelessness Working Group are:

  * Grant Shapps MP (Con) - Department for Communities and Local Government (housing and homelessness) (Chair)
  * Andrew Robathan MP (Con) - Ministry of Defence (welfare of veterans)
  * John Hayes MP (Con) - Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (adult skills)

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1840494,Grants Shapps to unlock tenants' right to manage their homes,"England's four million council housing tenants hold the key to improving their own neighbourhoods, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has said today.

Mr Shapps argued that some of the best examples of people contributing to the Big Society can be found on England's council estates - looking out for their neighbours and making efforts to make their streets better places to live. Yet only two per cent of council properties are run and managed by the tenants themselves.

So the minister has today backed tenants looking to build the Big Society in their neighbourhoods with up to £8m government cash.

This money will be used to set up Tenants Panels where the key decisions to improve the local area can be made - such as how quickly repairs should be made, measures to make their streets safer and children's play schemes. The panels can also be used to hold landlords to account.

The Minister is also planning to reduce bureaucracy and red tape to make it easier for tenants across the country to use their Right to Manage their council-run properties, take responsibility for managing their home from their landlords and take control for themselves.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Big Society is alive and well in many housing estates across the country - but I want to make it easier for those who want to build the Big Society in their own back yard to do so. The Right to Manage gives council tenants the opportunity to take power back from their landlords, and take control over their own homes and to make the changes they want to see.
> 
> ""There are inspiring examples across the country of where tenants have taken control. But at the moment, only two per cent of council properties are managed by their tenants - I want to see that figure increase substantially. That's why I'm backing tenants to the tune of up to £8m, and looking to cut the red tape and bureaucracy that stop so many people from coming forward.""
> 
> ""Council house tenants know the small changes that could make a big difference to their local community. They know the improvements that need to be made, and what local people want to see done. I want to see more tenants able to act and take control for themselves. But for years these tenants have felt powerless to act. From today, that can all change.""

### Notes for editors

1. Examples of communities taking up their Right to Manage include:

Bloomsbury Estate Management Board, Birmingham: Members of the board have focused on transforming the 1960s estate, with measures including demolishing a number of maisonettes and houses to rebuild them with low-rise flats; the building of a new leisure complex with funding from a successful Lottery bid, and setting a local ""Bloomsbury Standard"" for improvement to the properties that exceeds the Decent Homes Standard. Since taking responsibility for the estate, the Board has boosted rent arrears recovery and saved £750,000 over five years through better productivity.

Childwall Valley Estate Management Board, South Liverpool: Set up in 2000 in response to the council's 'emergency repairs only' policy, the board have worked to transform the estate by measures including introducing community wardens to work with local young people, the police and Citizens Advice Bureau to reduce anti-social behaviour and a major redevelopment involving the demolition of unpopular high rise blocks to make way for new homes. Over 90 per cent of residents are satisfied with the services provided by the board, and demand for properties on the estate now far exceeds supply.

New Barracks Tenant Management Cooperative, Salford: The cooperative manages 115 houses on an estate of six streets, and have raised funds for installing play equipment, have maintained the local park area, contributed half the cost to installing CCTV on the estate and introduced community activities including street parties and children's playschemes.

Pembrooke Estate Management Board, Plymouth: Set up in 1994, the Board manages the estate of 13 blocks of flats housing around 500 people, and has taken charge of a £5million refurbishment programme. Since doing so, crime rates have fallen, a Youth Service has been set up to encourage training for excluded school pupils and other vulnerable youngsters, and residents' surveys consistently show that local people consider the estate to be well managed, clean and safe.

2. Funding for the Tenant Empowerment Programme (TEP) is £8m over the Spending Review period (£2m in each of the next four financial years).

3. This programme is managed by the Tenant Services Authority on behalf of DCLG. It provides information, training, and capacity building to enable social housing tenants to challenge, influence or control how housing services are delivered to their communities, in order to improve the quality of life for residents. The programme supports activities over and above the activities that landlords' should provide as part of their regulatory responsibilities.

4. Local authority tenants currently have a statutory right to take over the management of local housing services. The _Housing (Right to Manage) (England) Regulations 2008_, together with statutory guidance, set out the procedures to be followed where a tenant management organisation proposes to enter into a management agreement with a local housing authority.

The importance of local solutions to tackle tenants' problems, including an enhanced role for tenant panels, was identified in the Government's Review of Social Housing Regulation - [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/socialhousingregulation).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1830185,Greater local powers to boost community-led regeneration,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell have today outlined how the Coalition Government is untying the hands of communities to find innovative ways to regenerate their area.

Ministers have signalled the end to top-down regeneration, which they argue pitted neighbour against neighbour and forced developments on communities that did not want them.

Instead, the Government is looking to devolve a wide range of powers from Whitehall to Town Halls - putting residents, local businesses, local authorities and civil society organisations in the driving seat and providing them with rewards and incentives to drive local regeneration and growth.

These include:

  * increasing local control of council budgets by removing the ringfence from billions of pounds of funding from central Government
  * the new Regional Growth Fund to support private sector enterprise, economic growth, and the creation of sustainable jobs
  * a simplified and streamlined National Planning Policy Framework, giving new powers and rights for local councils and communities to determine and influence what happens in their area.

In addition to this, councils will be able to raise additional funds to invest in their local area through the New Homes Bonus, where central Government will match the council tax raised from new homes built and empty homes brought back into use for the first six years.

Local people will work with councils to decide what to spend the extra money on - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing local facilities like swimming pools and leisure centres. This will mean that for the first time, communities will be able to see the benefits of development in their area for themselves.

Visiting the Baytree Renewal Area in Manchester, Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I want to see an end to the centrally-imposed regeneration regime which pitted neighbour against neighbour and forced developments on communities that did not want them.
> 
> ""That's why we're shifting the balance in favour of communities themselves, untying the hands of councils and residents so they can make the key decisions over how they would like to improve their own neighbourhoods.
> 
> ""Baytree is a great example of this. Local residents working with the Council to ensure that their views were factored into renewal work, and that the wishes of residents - more green spaces, improved security, and action on speeding vehicles and crime - were taken account of.
> 
> ""And with the New Homes Bonus offering powerful incentives for growth, councils will have the opportunity to invest these additional funds in their local area, while residents themselves will for the first time see the benefits of development for themselves.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Communities must no longer face instructions from central Government on regenerating their local areas, but must be free to take the lead and decide for themselves. That's why we're devolving a wide range of powers to councils and their residents alike.
> 
> ""The New Homes Bonus is a key component of this. For the first time, residents will have an incentive to give the green light to new developments in their area, and the extra Government funding they attract will be available for them to use as they see fit.
> 
> ""And neighbourhoods blighted by empty homes and the anti-social behaviour they attract can also benefit from extra Government cash by bringing these properties back into use for families in need.""

Today, Mr Shapps and Mr Stunell have also confirmed a further £5 million funding to encourage the newly-formed Local Enterprise Partnerships and new Local Authority partnerships to work together across boundaries to deliver large scale housing and regeneration schemes in key growth and Housing Market Renewal locations.

These extra freedoms and flexibilities sit alongside nearly £20 billion investment in growth and regeneration from central Government, through new infrastructure projects. This includes:

  * £7.5 billion towards Crossrail, providing significantly improved transport links from West to East London
  * £4.5 billion for new affordable homes, and over £2 billion investment in the Decent Homes programme which will halve the backlog of work, including refurbishing around 150,000 homes in the council sector
  * the £1.4 billion Regional Growth Fund to support private sector economic growth and the creation of sustainable jobs, particularly in areas dependent on public sector employment, which sits alongside another £1.4 billion from the European Regional Development Fund
  * £750 million towards High Speed Rail 2 over the next four years; and
  * £500 million investment to transform the Olympic Park after the 2012 Games to create a new community in East London.

Jackie Sadek, Chief Executive of UK Regeneration, said:

> ""We are delighted that the Government has set out a clear and very simple framework for regeneration. In keeping with its drive on localism the Government is focusing on enabling measures and a few key strategic interventions on transport. This offers all of us a challenge: taking this framework, with limited resources, and making things happen across the country. UK Regeneration is leading that drive.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2040696,Green Flag Awards: views invited on the future,"Lovers of green spaces will get the chance to have a say on the future of the prestigious Green Flag Award at an event next week at the Department for Communities and Local Government.

The Green Flag Award is the national benchmark for quality public green spaces such as parks and community gardens. It is highly regarded within the sector, credited with continually raising the quality standard of green spaces since its start in 1996. The award is recognised and used by the majority of local authority green space managers and increasingly by community and voluntary groups, and this year the Award celebrated a record number of flags.

The Department recently announced its intention to let the Green Flag Award scheme run under license from 1 September 2012. The meeting next week will be open to all, and will give interested parties the chance to give their views in person on the proposed license framework. Alternatively interested parties are invited to write in with their views before Christmas.

Ministers support the scheme and wish to see it sustained when the current arrangement to run the scheme ends 31 August next year. The Government's intention is to advertise next year for an external group to run the Green Flag Award scheme under license from 1 September 2012, and to invite bids. Details of the license offer will be available in February next year.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Green Flag Awards have done wonders in raising the standard and awareness of our Green parks and spaces and have a vital role in the future. I hope all those with an interest in the scheme will use this opportunity to help shape the future of the Green Flag Awards so we can all continue to recognise and celebrate what's best about our parks and green spaces.""

An opportunity to have your say on how the Green Flag Award scheme could be run under license and sustained post August 2012 is being held at 11.30am to 12.30pm on Wednesday 7 December 2011, at Eland House, Bressenden Place, London, SW1E 5DU.

If you are interested in attending this open opportunity to shape the future of the scheme or wish to write in with your views, please email Jonathon Cartwright at [jonathon.cartwright@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:jonathon.cartwright@communities.gsi.gov.uk) for further details (telephone: 0303 44 42604).

Indicating a highly valued national quality standard, Green Flags are awarded to the best local authority managed parks, and Green Pennants are awarded to volunteer and community run urban green spaces.

Green spaces are vitally important as 'green lungs' in our built-up areas, but  they can provide much more as shown by this years winners of the Green Flags and Pennants. They are important to people of all ages as a place to meet friends and family, celebrate, exercise, play games and sports, but some are also places to learn about not only plants, wildlife and farming but also art, music and films, and help bring the entire local community together.

While raising a Green Flag awarded to Millbank Gardens in central London, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The record number of Green Pennants awarded to local people showing what people can do for themselves in their local area is an amazing achievement! They are a model to us all and are real examples of 'Big Society' in action. What I have seen shows that sometimes the smallest spaces transformed are of the greatest benefit to their community if the community is involved from the start and drive the changes themselves.
> 
> ""I congratulate the park managers, park wardens and the volunteers for their success in being awarded Green Flags and Green Pennants and thank them for their hard work to create urban green places that people enjoy. The increase in the number of applications and winners this year is a very good sign of the Big Society to come.""

The Green Flag and Pennant Awards are run on behalf of Communities and Local Government by Keep Britain Tidy, British Trust for Conservation Volunteers and GreenSpace - known as the Green Flag Plus Partnership.

Millbank Gardens are a small pocket garden maintained by London Borough of Westminster Parks Department.** **It has been awarded a Green Flag for the first time. The garden provides a quiet green oasis for the residents of the near by housing estate and office workers. The borough provides regular patrol staff to reassure resents, and the garden and its wildlife benefit from the borough's recycling programme enabling twice yearly mulching of the shrubs.

Local residents Miriam Phillips, accompanied by Dachshund Dexter, and Frank Manikanza with Nerina, watched the flag raising ceremony.

Miriam Philips said:

> ""Many people come to the garden to enjoy the peacefulness at lunchtime. Its a great place to meet your neighbours and other local people.""

Frank Manikanza said:

> ""The garden is delightfully peaceful even though we are near very busy streets. It is very well maintained by the hard working team.""

Dexter and Nerina - who never poop in the garden - woofed their agreement!

The Green Pennant Awards are up by 46 per cent from 2008. The Gardens Community Garden in Haringey, north London that was first awarded a Green Pennant in 2006 and has been a winner for four consecutive years, is a prime example of what communities can achieve.

In 1999 the Gardens Residents' Association conceived the idea of a garden on an abandoned overgrown patch of land and a railway arch that had once provided access to the disused private road to 'Harringay Stadiums' dog racing track. The site had also provided a fast getaway route for thieves from both sides of the railway line. After three years of tracking down the owners of the disused land, raising funds, liaising with then Railtrack, Met Police, British Transport Police, Sainsbury's, Haringey Council and local residents, much gardening effort and commissioning metalworkers for the gates, the garden finally opened to the public in September 2002.

The Gardens' Community Garden, named after the nearby streets, is open everyday to the public, 9am to dusk 365 days a year and regularly holds events for the residents including fancy dress film nights, seed planting with Easter egg hunting for children, Halloween, Christmas and festive song evenings as well as other family events such as engagement parties. The project was a crime and community safety initiative and crime has greatly declined since the route through the railway archway was closed off by the creation of the storage area under the arch.

Maintenance is carried out be the residents and funding is raised through small grants from various sources, corporate donations and events. The Gardens cost a minimum of £1,000 per anum.

Andy Newman, the Gardens' coordinator and local resident, has been involved from the start. He said:

> ""The Garden is like a community centre without a roof. The Gardens Residents Association (GRA) use it for community screening of films and meetings, and local residents have booked it for birthday parties, and it has even been used for a funeral and christening. It is such a versatile space used by young and old.""

The Green Flag Award Scheme was launched in 1996.

Mr Clark praised all five finalists for going the extra mile to engage with the public in innovative ways. Town Hall workers who come up with their own ideas to give the public better local services will play a vital part in the Government's pledge to 'trust the people' as Ministers hand power back to local communities.

Greg Clark said:

> ""I was delighted to present this award to Jenny and I congratulate all the finalists who are fantastic ambassadors for their councils.
> 
> ""Good public service is often about the personal approach, having an understanding and commitment to the needs of the people who use the service.
> 
> ""Every one of the awards winners have shown what a massive difference they make personally by their work.""

The Grimsby Children's Centre offers a range of projects that are raising aspirations, offering life skills and empowering people to make a difference to their own lives. Jenny introduced a Peer Education Project, raising awareness of teenage pregnancy by training young mums to go into schools and talk to pupils about the realities of parenthood. Jenny is also the champion for a community allotment helping people with healthy eating and exercise.

The annual awards, presented by news presenter Jeremy Vine and run by the Local Government Channel, ask co-workers and the public to nominate individuals. The best nominations are then short-listed by a panel before being put to public vote.

""It weighs two stone"" he told the House, ""the document we've replaced it with is six pages and weighs an ounce.""

Regional plans and their centrally imposed building targets have now been scrapped. The Government said the top-down housebuilding targets had threatened the destruction of the Green Belt and had failed to increase housebuilding with much of the country facing the lowest peacetime housebuilding rates since 1924.

Councils now have the freedom to prepare their local plans without having to follow top-down targets from regional quangos and bureaucrats.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1721090,Greg Clark meets Big Society pioneers at Balsall Heath,"The network of local volunteers who transformed Balsall Heath in Birmingham are a national example of people power putting the Big Society into action, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said on a visit to the area today.

Mr Clark praised Balsall Heath's Neighbourhood Forum after hearing how local people had reclaimed their streets after being unhappy with the way the area had declined.

The Minister visited the Forum based in what once was once a patch of unkempt council land and is now an award-winning community garden centre. Meeting local residents who grow plants at the centre to place around the community, Mr Clark helped out with preparations for autumn planting.

Residents were told about the Government's new 'barrier busting team' whose sole purpose will be to help community groups like theirs get the backing they need when they encounter bureaucratic obstacles to local objectives.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Local people everywhere know the frustration of watching their town centre decline, their library shut or local crime rising. Here in Balsall Heath a network of local volunteers took the initiative and reclaimed their streets by thinking 'we can do better'.
> 
> ""I was delighted to meet the pioneering residents of Balsall Heath today and see real proof of the value of community participation. With over a thousand members their Neighbourhood Forum really represents local voices who have reshaped their community and made it a better place to live. They are the Big Society in action and other community groups can look to them as a perfect example of people power.
> 
> ""This Government is giving local people more power than ever to shape their neighbourhoods - from taking over the running of parks, libraries and post offices, to more powers to plan and shape housing developments. A new ""barrier-busting"" team will to help community groups like Balsall Heath get the backing they need when they encounter bureaucratic obstacles to their local objectives so volunteering communities can turn their ideas into action.""

Twenty-five years ago Balsall Heath was the centre of city's red-light district. Crime rates were high and the local police station was forced to close to the public, instead operating as a base for the vice squad.

Residents, unhappy with the decline of their local area and lack of services, resolved to work together to reclaim their streets and return a sense of community and pride establishing the neighbourhood forum that is still going strong today.

As crime fell the vice squad is now disbanded and this June residents joined together to reopen and staff the police station's front desk for five days a week and raised the funds to place 15 CCTV cameras in key locations in their community and monitor them from within the police station.

Dear Sir,

It is wrong to suggest that the draft National Planning Policy Framework does not encourage the use of Brownfield sites for development (14 September 2011). The draft framework states that ""plans should allocate land with the least environmental or amenity value"". That means, of course, using derelict land when considering where to develop in the future. But it also allows restored green space that was once in industrial use - such as urban nature reserves - to be protected. Our reforms will give power back to local communities to decide the areas they wish to see developed and those protected away from the interference of Whitehall.

That is precisely why we have introduced a number of incentives so people can reap the benefits from homes and businesses developed in their area, not just the costs.

We are giving councils substantial extra funding through a New Homes Bonus, with the Government matching the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years, and a new reformed Community Infrastructure Levy will give people a real say over how money from development is spent in their area. For the first time ever councils will be allowed to keep business rates they collect under proposals to reform local government funding, giving them a direct stake in growing the local economy and supporting new homes and jobs.

By allowing communities to directly benefit from the rewards of growth and enterprise, our approach will help to create the conditions where people begin to plan positively for growth.

Yours faithfully,

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1956169,Greg Clark sets out guarantee to local communities on simplifying planning system,"A new 'Planning Guarantee' will create greater certainty for local communities by speeding up local planning applications that get stuck in the system, Planning Minister Greg Clark announced in a letter to local councils today.

At the moment thousands of planning applications get caught in the system for over a year, leaving householders and local firms frustrated by delays to getting a decision. Today Mr Clark advised local authorities that the Planning Guarantee will mean that no planning application  should take longer than 12 months to reach a decision, including any appeal.

This ensures fairness for everybody and a level playing field for all applications, whether big or small. Local residents and local firms will have more confidence that their application will be dealt with swiftly and fairly.

Local people will be able to see how their councils performs against the Guarantee using information which is made available by councils as frequently as possible. Ministers expect this to be at least quarterly.

The Department will also publish a regular report on performance by individual councils. Full details of how the Guarantee will work will be published for consultation in the autumn.

Mr Clark said:

> ""We need a simpler, swifter planning system that delivers fairness for all, from householders to local firms and shops.
> 
> ""At the moment too many planning applications get stuck in the system for too long, leaving people in planning limbo.
> 
> ""The planning guarantee will help remove the uncertainty from the system for communities and ensure that every application, big or small, is dealt with quickly and fairly.""

Mr Clark also wants to cut down on paperwork in the planning system and simplify the application process. Whether it's a householder building an extension or a local shop expanding to the next building, applicants frequently complain that they are asked to give information of marginal relevance that can be very expensive to produce.

The Government will consult in the autumn on reducing the information required to accompany all planning applications. Ministers are keen to hear from local people, local firms, councils, and other parties on what information is really helpful and necessary.

Today's reforms are part of a programme of work to simplify the planning system and make it less bureaucratic for everyone. The Government has already cut reams of unwieldy planning policy down to a tightly focused draft National Planning Policy Framework, published by Mr Clark on Monday this week.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1930577,Greg Clark signals boost for 'meanwhile uses' of empty buildings,"Planning Minister Greg Clark today said the Government could scrap red tape in order to encourage 'meanwhile uses' of empty buildings, transforming them into new shops, business start-ups, and community projects.

Empty properties can lead to a spiral of decline, spoil high streets, and act as a magnet for anti-social behaviour. Meanwhile uses are a way of putting a vacant space back into good use for the benefit of the whole community while a permanent solution is found.

In London's Exmouth Market, for example, a shop lying empty for two years has been transformed by social enterprise Meanwhile Space into a hub offering space to business start-ups and community-focused projects. Shop space has already been booked by a furniture business and a vintage wares store eager to try out their business idea.

Mr Clark believes that it should be easier for businesses and communities to arrange meanwhile uses for empty buildings without having to jump through unnecessary hoops in the planning system.

The Minister today signalled that the Government could scrap rules requiring costly and time consuming planning permission in order to temporarily change the use of empty buildings, as part of a future wider review on deregulating the used class orders system.

This could help reinvigorate local high streets, encourage community enterprises; support entrepreneurs to start-up, contribute to economic growth; and help build stronger, more vibrant communities.

Mr Clark said:

> ""Empty properties can drain the life away from town centres and are a waste of a valuable social and economic resource.
> 
> ""We want to make it easier for businesses and community enterprises to reanimate vacant spaces, helping to revive struggling high streets and kick-start local growth.
> 
> ""Removing bureaucratic barriers in the planning system could play a major part in encouraging meanwhile uses of empty buildings, transforming them into new shops, business start-ups and community projects.""

Eddie Bridgeman from Meanwhile Space, a social enterprise which brings empty spaces back into use, said:

> ""We welcome the fact that the Government is considering getting rid of the need for planning permission for the temporary use of buildings.
> 
> ""This could give a big boost to getting business and community enterprises into empty premises.""

Removing the need for planning permission to temporarily change the use of empty buildings could be a key part of a future Government consultation on deregulating the use class order system. The Government wants to hear similar ideas and views on how the 'change of use' part of the planning system can be improved.

The Government is already working to cut down planning bureaucracy and has announced a full review of national planning policy by 2012. For example it is already consulting on allowing commercial property to be changed into residential property without needing planning permission. This could create 70,000 new homes over 10 years.

The Plan for Growth, published alongside the Budget in March, set out a radical plan of reform to help deliver strong, balanced and sustainable growth in the long term. Reform of the planning system is a key element of that, and today's announcement is another step to creating the right conditions for businesses, to start up, invest and grow.

### Notes to editors

1. The Use Class Order review is being undertaken jointly by DCLG and BIS.

2. The outcomes of this review on how change of use is handled in the planning system through the Use Class Order, and permitted development rights will be announced later this year. Any proposals for changes to legislation will then be subject to formal public consultation.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1968460,Greg Clark visits new enterprise zone for the Humber,"The announcement of the successful Humber Enterprise Zone to drive local growth and create thousands of new jobs was followed today with a visit by the Cities Minister Greg Clark.

Located on both banks of the Humber, the Enterprise Zone will accelerate local economic growth and create over 12,500 new jobs. The zone will offer discounts on business rates and fast-track planning control as well enhanced capital allowances.

The Humber Enterprise Zone is ambitious and will kick-start the development of a new manufacturing sector in the UK, focussed on the construction of off shore wind turbines. It will leverage existing assets and a high level of private sector investment and require only a relatively small contribution from the public purse to ensure jobs are created in the UK rather than abroad.

With the backing and support of Greg Clark, discussions about the best way to support local growth were cemented by the decision to form a Local Enterprise Partnership early in the summer. Without the decision to forge ahead and establish a partnership there would be no Enterprise Zone today.

The success of the bid has been a tremendous example of the public and private sectors coming together in order to work out what is best for the local area. Greg Clark has been instrumental in this process, bringing all parties together to explore the best options for growth.

Greg Clark said:

> ""The decision to award Humber its own Enterprise Zone is great news for residents of the area, encouraging new businesses to flock to the site creating much needed jobs and prosperity.
> 
> ""I've been working over the past year with local business and civic leaders to make sure Humber can take up the reins of their local economy, and the Enterprise Zone is the culmination of those plans to accelerate growth. It shows what can be done when the public and private sector come together to remove the barriers to growth and create the conditions in which enterprise will flourish.
> 
> ""Never has there been a more important time to unleash the potential of our most important cities as engines for growth across the country.""

John Clugston, Chair of the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership said:

> ""Our Enterprise Zone will be crucial for attracting major investors in renewable energy to the UK. By helping us to bring in the biggest manufacturers and their supply chains, the Enterprise Zone takes us a  step closer to creating a super cluster on the Humber which will have  national and international significance. This would kick start a long term transformation in the fortunes of the Humber economy, so it is excellent news that the bid has been approved.""

The geographic potential of the Humber is clear: it is the largest trading estuary in the UK and the fourth largest in Europe, with a chemical and process sector worth £6 billion a year and international expertise in logistics. However, unemployment is high in most of the main urban centres and wages are low. The Enterprise Zone will provide a huge boost to the area and is an exciting development for local businesses and residents.

Businesses in the Humber across all sectors have shown their enthusiasm about the opportunities for the developments in renewable energy, and are determined to capitalise on them.

The Humber Enterprise Zone is one of a few areas across the country that has secured Enhanced Capital Allowances on sites that will provide opportunities for businesses and help attract Foreign Direct Investment building on the key strengths of the area especially the skilled workforce.

### Notes to editors

1. The Government also announced the allocation of funding for the UK's broadband network yesterday, with English counties due to receive £294.8 million and Scotland £68.8 million. Further details can be found at: [www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/8389.aspx](http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/8389.aspx) (external link).

2. Humber Enterprise Zone - led by the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership proposes:

  * Size: 375 hectares, across two sites in Kingston upon Hull and one site near Killingholme in North Lincolnshire;

  * Sector Focus: offshore wind Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and supply chain;

  * Tax breaks: Save businesses £7.9 million in forgone business rates;

  * Job creation: Local Enterprise Partnership estimates that 4,850 jobs could be created by 2015;

  * Planning: Simplified regime with a presumption - removing the need for specific planning permission with a single Local Development Order.

3. Enterprise Zones will benefit from:

  *  A 100 per cent business rate discount worth up to £275,000 over a five year period, for businesses that move into an Enterprise Zone during the course of this Parliament;
  * All business rates growth within the zone for a period of at least 25 years will be retained and shared by the local authorities in the Local Enterprise Partnership area to support their economic priorities;
  * Government and local authority help to develop radically simplified planning approaches in the zone; and
  * Government support to ensure superfast broadband is rolled out in the zone. This will be achieved through guaranteeing the most supportive environment and, if necessary, public funding.

4. The Government will make enhanced capital allowances for investment in plant and machinery available in designated areas within a limited number of Enterprise Zones. This is only available where the Government and Local Enterprise Partnership agree that it is better for the local economy to focus on a smaller number of companies making significant capital intensive investments. The vast majority of Enterprise Zones will retain a focus on attracting greater volumes of companies through business rate discounts.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1840832,Communities to lead local growth,"Putting power into the hands of local people to shape their neighbourhoods will help to ensure growth that is sustainable, responsible and green, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said today.

At the Campaign to Protect Rural England's (CPRE's) prestigious annual lecture, the Minister acknowledged the CPRE's long held belief that communities should be at the heart of planning. Neighbourhood planning can achieve this and bring about sustainable growth by allowing communities to decide what their area should look like, where new shops, offices or homes should go and what green spaces should be protected.

Communities will be central to deciding the shape of their local area under wide ranging reforms going through Parliament in the Localism Bill. Local people will have a powerful new right through neighbourhood planning to help ensure development is well sited, well designed, locally supported and in line with the right environmental standards.

Mr Clark encouraged CPRE members to use their experience and expertise to help enthuse and inspire communities about the new opportunities that will be opening up for them through the Localism Bill.

Mr Clark said:

> ""Our built environment has been a source of incalculable pleasure and benefit for generations. In rural areas, the interplay of natural beauty and human stewardship has made this country's landscapes the envy of the world.
> 
> ""I am in favour of, and want to see more of, properly planned, properly managed, locally-supported growth - well sited, well designed; meeting the right environmental standards; and in tune with what local people want.
> 
> ""Neighbourhood planning will be a radical new means for people to influence growth and shape the look and feel of the places where they live. Voluntary and community groups such as the CPRE, with their understanding of the grass roots, could play a vital role in enthusing, informing and inspiring local communities about the new opportunities that will be opening up for them.""

Shaun Spiers, CPRE's Chief Executive, said:

> ""Empowering local communities to shape the places where they live should be a central part of the new planning system. CPRE has championed local involvement in planning for many years, so we welcome the aspirations that underpin the Localism Bill.
> 
> ""As the Bill progresses we want to work with the Government to ensure that local and neighbourhood plans deliver truly sustainable development that meets local needs.""

The Government also intends to back up its commitment to protect the Green Belt by bringing in new designations that will allow local people to nominate green areas they want to protect while enabling sustainable development to continue. Proposals for how the new designations may work will be put to Parliament soon.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1836144,Councils should reveal voluntary sector funding,"Councils should publish their spending on the voluntary and community sector as part of increasing transparency, opening up services locally and dispersing power more widely, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said today.

Mr Clark has written to all council leaders (see link, right) saying the Government will expect them to publish all grants and payments, as well as copies of contracts and tenders, they make to the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector.

The Government believes it is essential local people know how much funding is directed towards voluntary and community groups not only to increase local accountability on spending decisions, but also because the sector can offer good value for taxpayers' money when commissioned to provide services.

Making the data public can help highlight inefficiency and open new markets for local small businesses and voluntary groups by revealing how services are currently delivered so they can assess whether they could submit a credible bid to run them differently and deliver greater value for money.

The letter acknowledges that many councils are strengthening their ties with the voluntary and community sector in innovative ways to help protect front line services and ensure support continues. It also encourages councils to share positive approaches taken to protect funding to the sector, drawing on the enthusiasm of volunteers, and the goodwill of local communities.

For example, Reading Borough Council believes that its voluntary activity contributes hugely to the town success. As a result it has allocated an extra £220,000 to voluntary organisations in the coming year taking its total funding to over £7m.

The Localism Bill will create the circumstances by which the voluntary sector and community groups can challenge for the right to deliver services differently.

Mr Clark said:

> ""Many councils are strengthening their ties with the voluntary and community sector because they recognise the vital role they can play in delivering high quality front line services.
> 
> ""Often voluntary and community groups offer good value for taxpayers' money when commissioned to provide services, drawing on the enthusiasm of volunteers, and the goodwill of local communities.
> 
> ""By requiring all councils to openly publish their grants and payments under contracts and increasing transparency on local spending, we want to open up new opportunities for the voluntary and community sector to participate in local life.
> 
> ""lf local small businesses and voluntary groups can understand how services are currently delivered they can better assess whether they might be able to put forward a credible bid to run them differently and deliver greater value for money.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2044052,Date set for elected city mayors,"England's largest cities moved closer to deciding on directly elected mayors today after Cities Minister Greg Clark set the date for local referendums.

Ballot boxes will open across Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle Upon-Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield on 3 May 2012 for people to vote for an elected mayor. This is the same date as most of their local elections.

Where people vote in favour, the city will move to an elected mayor and hold elections. Directly elected mayors is just one of the measures in the Government's Localism Act, which ushers in a new era of people power.

Elected mayors can provide strong, democratically accountable leadership, maximising their city's potential for economic growth and bringing real benefits for residents and businesses when backed with the right powers.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Our greatest cities can benefit from strong, visible leadership and international standing that a mayor, elected with a clear mandate, can bring.
> 
> ""Around the world, including in London, a mayor has become a vital part in ensuring that a great city has a strong voice and can attract investment from home and aboard.
> 
> ""Britain's success depends on the success of our great cities and I am convinced that an elected mayor, taking powers previously confined to ministers, can help realise their potential.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to create directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London. The Localism Act empowers local people to decide whether they want an elected mayor for their city. Mayoral referendums are being held on local Election Day on 3 May 2012. Leicester has recently elected a Mayor. Bristol will hold their next local election in 2013 and Nottingham will hold theirs in 2015.

2. If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that city will then rapidly hold an election for its first mayor. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

3. The consultation document 'What can a mayor do for your city?' is available at [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/mayorsconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/mayorsconsultation). The consultation runs until 3 January 2012. The proposals in this consultation paper relate to the 12 cities.

4. Secondary legislation, including Regulations setting out the rules for conducting governance referendums, including mayoral referendums, was laid in Parliament today.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1875424,More new powers for councils to bust barriers,"Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark has today unveiled new powers for councils to hold Government to account and make sure requests from their local communities to remove unnecessary regulations are properly considered.

In plans for new measures under the Sustainable Communities Act, Mr Clark has set out a new simple process by which councils can directly ask Whitehall to remove barriers that can block local people from improving their communities. Previously, councils had to jump through hoops and stick to rigid timetables before any barriers were taken seriously. The new process is direct and straightforward - saving council officials precious time and the taxpayer thousands of pounds in administrative costs.

Last year, Mr Clark set out an 'action plan' to respond to proposals already submitted under the Act. He also said that the Government was ""open for business"" to bust barriers, and that councils could submit requests as soon as they come to light, without having to navigate deadlines or wait for bottlenecks to clear. Because the timetable will be rolling, proposals can be considered more quickly.

The changes have also increased transparency as councils are now able to discuss their proposals directly with Whitehall. Everyone can see the progress being made online, as well as reasons for the Government's decision on whether to implement suggestions. Today's announcement means the Local Government Association will have the power to challenge a decision if a particular council isn't happy with an outcome. Where there is a challenge, the Government will have to consult the Local Government Association before issuing the final decision.

The new system enables councils to submit ideas via a dedicated 'barrier busting' website and follow the progress of their suggestions online. People who use the service [barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link) are given a unique Amazon-style tracking number to monitor requests and a named 'barrier buster' assigned to each case.

Greg Clark said:

> ""I've been hugely inspired by the Sustainable Communities Act. Its ethos - giving local taxpayers a bigger say in how their money is spent, and helping councils challenge central government to cut red tape - is absolutely in line with what we're seeking to do in the Localism Bill.
> 
> ""I want to turbo-charge the Sustainable Communities Act. We're getting rid of the bureaucracy so that it's easier than ever for people with bright ideas for improving local life to ask for central government's assistance.
> 
> ""Our barrier busting website is open for business, ready and waiting to sweep away the obstacles and help local people do things their way.""

A spokesman for Local Works commented:

> ""Both Local Works and the Sustainable Communities Act are based on the fundamental principle that local people are experts in finding their own local solutions to their own local problems. The Act remains one of the few genuine bottom up processes which allow communities to have greater control over things that affect their everyday lives.
> 
> ""We are glad the Government have recognised this and we urge local councils and communities to use this new process to deliver real change from their communities.""

The Local Government Association, the 'selector' under the Sustainable Communities Act, will enjoy more flexibility and fewer burdens than before. There will be a larger role for representatives from local and parish councils, and community groups - allowing a wider range of people to voice their opinions on the most severe barriers to localism.

Barriers to community action that have already been identified include:

  * Criminal Records Bureau checks on volunteering

  * rules that prevent welfare claimants from taking part-time jobs or longer work placements

  * competition laws that prevent businesses from collaborating on sector-wide initiatives

  * health and safety regulations

  * public liability insurance and catering licences running stalls at events.

Some of the proposals taken forward under the Sustainable Communities Act previously are:

  * Poole asked for a reduction in ringfencing of local government grants. The Comprehensive Spending Review created significant new local discretion in finances.
  * Wirral wanted it to be easier for local communities to take control of assets. Measures in the Localism Bill are designed to achieve this.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation can be found at [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/scaconsultation2011](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/scaconsultation2011). The deadline for responses is 20 June 2011.

2. The new online portal at [barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link) is open to anyone who wishes to ask the Government to remove a barrier that is stopping local action.

3. Mr Clark has previously set out an 'action plan' for proposals already submitted under the Sustainable Communities Act and set out flexible working arrangements for communities and councils, to make the system less bureaucratic. The previous announcement can be seen here: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1799233](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1799233).

4. The consultation asks for views on new regulations to govern the arrangements following the second invitation under the Sustainable Communities Act, issued on 15 December 2010. Under the previous invitation, issued in October 2008, local authorities were required to set up special Panels of Representatives of Local People, which had to include those from under-represented backgrounds. They had to submit proposals to the Local Government Association by the end of July 2009. The Local Government Association were required to shortlist proposals, accompanied by a report. On receipt of the short-list, in late December 2009, the Secretary of State was required to consult the Local Government Association and try to reach agreement on all the proposals contained within. This process meant no formal decisions could be made until 15 December 2010.

5. The light-touch regulations proposed in the consultation will place duties on the Secretary of State to:

  * consider a request by the selector to take action to remove a bureaucratic barrier, which the Secretary of State has previously decided not to implement
  * consult and try to reach agreement with the selector before deciding whether the request should be implemented in whole or in part
  * publish the decision, with reasons
  * state any action to be taken with a view to implementing the proposal; and
  * publish an update on that action, should it not be complete within one year.

6. The regulations will also allow the selector, the Local Government Association, to appoint an advisory panel to assist it in its duties.

7. In November 2006 the Sustainable Communities Bill was introduced to Parliament as a Private Members Bill. Local Works, a project of Unlock Democracy is a coalition of over 100 national organisations which successfully delivered the bill  through Parliament and now campaigns to promote the use of the Sustainable Communities Act.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1652536,Three actions needed to help the Big Society grow,"![Greg Clark speaking at the Policy Exchange](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1653653.jpg)In a major speech to the Policy Exchange, Greg Clark set out three key actions that will be fundamental to decentralising power and building the Big Society.

Mr Clark said that the UK has become one of the most centralised countries in the democratic world ""not just in respect of the balance of power between central and local government, but also in the disempowerment of the professions in the public sector; and in the way that voluntary organisations have been pushed out of the provision of public services.""

He said that decentralising power is what most unites the coalition and that for the ""first time in decades the most powerful forces in British politics are aligned in favour of decentralisation.""

> ""We need to turn central government upside down and inside-out.""

Already, Ministers have begun to remove swathes of the obvious centralising and red tape policies have put ""outrageous impositions on local freedom"", Mr Clark said, including ending Regional Strategies and putting housing back into local hands, making the health service more answerable to patients not politicians, allowing parents, teachers and charities to set up 'Free schools', abolishing Home Information Packs and a burdensome council inspection regime.

> ""We need to turn central government upside down and inside-out. Instead of the civil service only being focused upwards on providing advice to Ministers - and inwards on its own priorities - we must drive the focus downwards and outwards to put those resources at the service of communities nationwide.""

But the decentralisation of power and building the Big Society will depend on three further fundamental actions:

### Fundamental actions - a right to know

Firstly a 'right to know', as part of a new era of transparency and public accountability.

Mr Clark said:

> ""When public money is being spent, people should always be able to know how much is being spent and on what. This should apply to central government, local government and all public bodies that disburse public funds. Transparency is the foundation of accountability. It is also a powerful means of promoting efficiency, without requiring the heavy-handed intervention of an unaccountable bureaucracy.""

### Fundamental actions - a right to challenge

Secondly, 'the Right of Challenge' so consumers never again feel powerless to challenge the way public services are deployed.

Mr Clark said:

> ""The consumers - and potential producers - of public services should have the right to change the way that public resources are deployed wherever and whenever a better proposal can be found. Judgements on these proposals should be made at the most local level possible - thereby enabling communities to truly take control of their own development.
> 
> ""We should send a clear message to various public sector bureaucracies that their duty is to facilitate the decentralisation of power. Communities must stand before the bureaucracy as free agents demanding what is theirs, not as supplicants begging for scraps of freedom. That is why this government views self-determination as a right and not a privilege.""

### Fundamental actions - turning Government on its head

Thirdly, ""turning Government on its head""  so it works for communities, not just Ministers.

Mr Clark said ""The state should exist to serve civil society, not the other way round."" The department is already establishing a ""barrier-busting"" team whose sole purpose will be to help community groups get the backing they need when they encounter bureaucratic obstacles to local objectives.

Mr Clark said:

> ""If we want change to happen at the most local level, then we have to understand that at such a scale even the slightest bureaucratic hurdle looms large. Furthermore, it is very difficult for community institutions to get the help they need to get around these obstacles. That is why we need to turn central government upside down and inside-out. Instead of the civil service only being focused upwards on providing advice to Ministers - and inwards on its own priorities - we must drive the focus downwards and outwards to put those resources at the service of communities nationwide.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1883285,Growth plan to transform empty offices into new homes,"In a major effort to boost housing supply, dormant offices will be unshackled from a bureaucratic planning system so they can be transformed into new homes under proposals unveiled by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

Beyond the inherited economic conditions the Government believes one of the key barriers to increasing housing supply is the lack of land and buildings available for residential development or conversion.

In 2009-10 housebuilding hit a record low of 129,000 new homes, the lowest level in any peacetime year since 1924. Only 2.8 per cent came from office conversions. This is at odds with the latest commercial vacancy rate of 7-9 per cent, which suggests there is an oversupply of commercial land.

Today Mr Pickles is publishing a consultation that proposes to scrap the planning approval requirement for changing use from a commercial property to a residential property, which can be costly and time consuming, so it is easier for developers to turn vacant offices into new homes.

Plans to bring empty commercial buildings back in to use to increase housing supply by deregulating the planning system were set out in the Budget's Growth Review.

If all the long-term office space currently available was converted it could potentially deliver 250,000 new homes and save just under £140 million over ten years in unnecessary red tape costs.

A wider review of the change of use rules, known as Use Classes Orders, and its interaction with permitted development rights will also be carried out to reduce the planning burden further.

Today Mr Pickles also called for local communities and authorities to make greater use of their existing local planning powers, Local Development Orders, to grant permission and reduce the planning burden locally.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Many towns and cities have office blocks, warehouse and business parks needlessly lying empty, while housebuilding has fallen to the lowest in peace time history because the planning system has tied developers up in knots of red tape.
> 
> ""By unshackling developers from a legacy of bureaucratic planning we can help them turn thousands of vacant commercial properties into enough new homes to jump start housing supply and help get the economy back on track. Councils already have powers to give greater local planning discretion and they should us them more to promote growth.""

Decentralisation and Planning Minister Greg Clark added:

> ""Patterns of office use have changed as employers prefer large open plan spaces to individual offices and as more and more people work from home. That has meant that there are many offices that have been vacant for years.
> 
> ""This change will make it easy to turn redundant offices into much needed homes. This will replace derelict properties with buildings in good use, contribute to relieving Britain's housing shortage and give a valuable boost to the building industry.""

The Government has already taken action to help increase availability of land and housing supply. This includes the New Homes Bonus, Community Infrastructure Levy and measures in the Localism Bill including Neighbourhood Plans, the Community Right to Build, and the Community Right to Buy.

In addition, Ministers have announced a full review of national planning policy by 2012, and a commitment to reduce regulations on housebuilders, including the introduction of a local standards framework. The Homes and Communities Agency is also examining how the disposal of publicly owned land can be used for housing.

### Notes to editors

1. The consultation seeks views on the proposal to amend the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 to grant permitted development rights for change of use from class B1 (Business), B2 (General Industry) and B8 (Storage and distribution) to class C3 (Dwelling houses) without the need for planning applications. It will run from 8 April to 30 June 2011 and can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/relaxationchangeconsultation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/relaxationchangeconsultation).

2. The Use Classes Order is a deregulatory device which allows change of use between land uses that have similar impacts, without applying for planning permission. The Government wishes to review the scope for extending the freedoms available through this route, while ensuring that planning and land use impacts are properly taken into account. To this end, the Government is proposing action on three fronts:

  * To provide for the change from commercial (B use classes) to residential use without the need to apply for planning permission. This responds to the recognised and urgent need to increase housing supply at a national level. Proposals are set out in this consultation document;
  * A call to local communities and local authorities to use imaginatively the powers they already have to relax planning constraints locally to target local issues, encourage development, support local economic strategies and make best use of existing properties; and
  * To remove unnecessary barriers to change of use through a wider review of how change of use and permitted development is managed within the planning system.

3. The Use Classes Order was last revised in 2005. Given the broader changes that are being made to the planning system through the Localism Bill, the National Planning Policy Framework and the presumption in favour of sustainable development, a review of how change of use is best provided for in the planning system is timely.

To celebrate the important that role counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria, and the Hampshire County Council flag is now being flown as part of this event.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended earlier this year by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Leader of Hampshire County Council, Councillor Ken Thornber said:

> ""Hampshire County Council is pleased and proud to have its flag flying over DCLG Headquarters forming part of this celebration of England's counties. The people of Hampshire will also be pleased to see this recognition.""

We are evolutionally hard wired to notice changes in the sounds around us. In years gone by this natural instinct gave us early warning of approaching predators, but today it means that unusual sounds like a smoke alarm or siren will set off warning signals in our brains.

With a sounder pitched at the most sensitive range of the human hearing (3,000Hz), a triggered alarm will instantly grab the attention, while the persistent beeping means that we can't get used to the noise and tune it out as we do with many everyday sounds. Smoke alarms set at lower frequencies or set to vibrate and flash can produce the same effect for the hard of hearing.![Image: Smoke alarm](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2068897.jpg)

All smoke alarms also have to be capable of waking an adult from deep sleep, which means they must sound at a minimum of 85 decibels from three metres away - that's comparable to the volume of a bus passing through your living room.

Other sounds that affect the ear in this way include:

  * Opera Singers, who sing loudest at the frequencies where the ear is most sensitive so they can be heard over the orchestra.
  * Vehicle reverse warnings, which caused so many noise complaints in residential areas that alternative versions have been developed with, for example, a ""shh shh"" noise instead.

Sir Ken Knight, the Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser said:

> ""It's a familiar situation - burning bacon or a sneaky cigarette can set a smoke alarm off all too easily, and the noise is enough to drive you out of house and home. But that's exactly the point of a smoke alarm - we are hard-wired to associate its sound with danger.""

### A matter of life and death

Never, ever remove the batteries in your alarm. It may be frustrating to find your fry-up has set it off again, but a working smoke alarm could mean the difference between life and death in a real house fire.

Prof. Trevor Cox, President of the Institute of Acoustics said:

> ""The high pitched beep-beep-beep of a smoke alarm can be irritating when set off by accident. But what makes that sound annoying - the pitch, volume and pattern of the alarm - all trigger powerful instinctive threat responses in your brain and warn you of danger. If you're in a real fire, this irritating sound could save your life, so trust your instincts and check your smoke alarm regularly.""

Emma Harrison, RNID Director of Public Engagement said:

> ""Fire can strike at anyone's home, but not everyone is equally protected because people who are deaf or hard of hearing can't rely on hearing an ordinary alarm. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, there a wide range of smoke alarms available specifically designed for you.""

### Background

**Volume**

An average smoke alarm is required to sound at 85 decibels from a distance of three metres - it will be much louder at close range.

Hearing protection becomes necessary in an industrial environment at 85 decibels as sustained exposure could result in hearing loss.

Other everyday noises:

  * Library: 30db
  * Normal Conversation: 30db
  * Average office: 60 db
  * Alarm clock: 70 db
  * Barking dog: 75 db
  * Smoke alarm (3 metres) 85 db
  * Aeroplane from a mile away:85 db
  * Motorbike:100 db
  * Orchestra: 105 db
  * Power saw: 110 db
  * Jet takeoff: 140 db

**Pitch**

Added to this, most smoke alarms sound at a frequency of around 3000 Hz, the uppermost range of a piccolo or violin.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1836598,Have your say on new community rights to challenge and run local services,"Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today opened a consultation on how revolutionary new rights for communities should work in practice.

The Community Right to Challenge and Community Right to Buy are two key elements of the Localism Bill, designed to hand power back to local people. They will enshrine in law the opportunity for community and voluntary groups to have a greater say over what happens in their local area.

Under the **Community Right to Buy**, local groups will have a legal right to nominate any vital community asset - including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres - to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. The asset could then be listed for five years. In that time, the owner of a listed asset will have to tell the council if they intend to sell, which will trigger a window of opportunity or 'community countdown', giving people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to make a credible bid before it goes on the open market.

The **Community Right to Challenge** opens the door to a transformation in the way that local public services are run. It will give community or voluntary sector groups, as well as parish councils and council employees, new powers to challenge and take over a local service. This could include running children's centres, social care services and even improving local transport links. Under the new law, councils must respond to this challenge and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. If the proposal is turned down the council must publish the reasons for this. This new right puts voluntary and charity groups on the front foot when it comes to running public services and has the potential to open up new revenue for them.

The consultations will run for 12 weeks from today, taking views from people, councils and their employees, community groups, voluntary organisations, private businesses and other interested parties.

The consultation documents can be viewed online here: [www.communities.gov.uk/consultations/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/publications/consultations/)

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""It's vital that services respond to what local people really want, and give people the chance to do things their way.
> 
> ""Many voluntary and community groups have outstanding ideas about how they could deliver local services at high quality and reasonable cost, or run the local buildings and businesses that people care about in the best interests of the community.
> 
> ""We want to make it as easy as possible for them to put the new rights in the Localism Bill into practice - and we welcome thoughts on how.""

The Community Right to Buy consultation will consider a number of elements, including:

  * who should be able to nominate land or buildings for the 'most wanted list', and how
  * who should be able to trigger the 'community countdown' and whether community groups should be able to buy an asset during that period, before it goes on the open market
  * what type of land and buildings should be excluded from being put on the list.
  * how long the window of opportunity (or 'community countdown') for community groups should be

The Community Right to Challenge consultation will also consider a number of different options, including:

  * which services should not be subject to challenge
  * what information should be included in an expression of interest
  * how long a local authority has to consider an expression of interest
  * possible reasons for modifying or rejecting an expression of interest

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1997142,Helping local building businesses aim high and get innovative,"A new £4.3 million pound low carbon project has been launched in the West Midlands set to help over 120 local building businesses learn about and take forward business opportunities using innovative technologies.

Over 345 pre-war and Victorian houses will be refurbished to demonstrate the benefits of installing environmental technologies, and put to the test by local residents who will live and benefit from the energy efficient housing driving up demand and creating further opportunities for local businesses.

The Aim High project is supported by over £2.1 million from the European Regional Development Fund which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and match funded by Birmingham City Council and the private sector through the British Gas Community Energy Saving Programme.

This project builds upon Birmingham City Council's investment and commitment to the £100 million Birmingham Energy Savers programme, and will also help businesses get involved in the Government's 'Green Deal' scheme launched last year.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""The Green Deal, which is set to revolutionise the energy efficiency of British properties, will only work if we are able to get local businesses ready to take forward new technologies within the property market. Therefore projects such as this are crucial.
> 
> ""It's important that we are delivering projects that benefit local businesses and also those that make a difference to the local community and its residents. The energy efficient nature of this project will deliver many benefits for local people such as cheaper fuel bills which is a real benefit in the current climate. I am pleased to be able to announce specific financial support from the European Regional Development Fund to take this forward within the West Midlands and help local businesses grow and diversify, assist local people and improve the local economy"".

Birmingham City Council's Cabinet Member for Housing, Cllr John Lines, said:

> ""I am delighted that this funding will help to build on the excellent work already undertaken by Birmingham City Council through our Decent Homes and Birmingham Energy Savers programmes. The project will help residents through improved energy efficiency, and also be of great benefit to local businesses, supporting the local economy and the creation of jobs""

Businesses will also be able to access support and guidance explaining how to enter the market and form consortiums with like-minded businesses to successfully bid for contracts within this area.

Birmingham is already leading the way in improving the energy efficiency of homes, according to recent government figures. The local authority installed the largest number of insulation measures over the last year (April 2010 to march 2011) through the carbon emissions reduction target and the AIM High project will further enhance the city's efforts to improve energy efficiency.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1624197,Helping tenants have a stronger voice,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps wants to give housing professionals the powers they need to make the right decisions for their communities - whether that's providing more homes or helping tenants have a stronger voice.

In a speech at the Chartered Institute of Housing conference, Mr Shapps spoke about how he wants to see tenants and their representatives firmly in the driving seat - giving them the platform to get things done. One option he is looking at is Tenants' Panels. Tenants will be able to complain to their panel and the panel would have real powers to intervene to resolve problems. Along with elected councillors and MPs,tenants' panels could also act as a new gateway to the Ombudsman.

### Large Quango not the way forward

The Minister has also made clear the huge premium he places on tenant empowerment, but he is far from convinced that a large national quango is the best way to do it. He confirmed the Government review of the role and purpose of the Tenants Services Authority and the best framework for regulating social housing. This will consider the full range of options in line with the Government's commitment to reduce the number of quangos.

Mr Shapps said:

> ""I believe that we can cut out unnecessary inspection - decentralise power, reduce bureaucracy and save money. But I want to reassure you that Government absolutely recognises the value of independent economic regulation of social housing.
> 
> ""This is why I intend to ensure that economic regulation continues to enable housing associations to secure significant private investment into affordable housing.""

The Minister also confirmed that in future the Homes and Communities Agency will be smaller and more strategic - with its functions delivered under local leadership. Mr Shapps added:

> ""The Homes and Communities Agency will stay. But I think it needs to operate in a genuinely local way - at the invitation of local people who want to improve their communities.
> 
> ""So it will be smaller, more strategic - with the HCA's functions being delivered under local leadership. It will be much leaner. To use the jargon I see it as an enabling and investment body. Or in plain English, the people who help to get things done.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1973439,Helping to meet a growing demand: new guide to help community orchards blossom,"![Apple tree in an orchard](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1973458.jpg)A new, simple 'how to' guide for communities wanting to start up, share or save their own community orchards that could help reverse the national decline in traditional orchards has been published by Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today.

The [community orchards guide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/orchardshowto) - part of a series of booklets being produced by Government in the coming months to cut out red tape and make it easier for people to get the information they need to get involved - brings together in one place practical advice and guidance for green fingered enthusiasts who want to make the most of green spaces in their area.

The guide outlines what new and existing support and powers are available for communities wanting to conserve or create community orchards. It provides links to expert organisations, information on where to go for funding and examples of communities across the country busy preparing to harvest their latest crop.

Ministers are also keen to see local authorities freeing up existing unused or under utilised land to communities. Successful community projects like the Todmorden Incredible Edible scheme have already shown how scrubland and verges too small to be used as allotments or open spaces can be 'greened up' by local people and transformed into growing space. Councils, by making land available, can help communities grow their own and improve sustainability whilst fostering a growing sense of community.

Eric Pickles, launching the new guide said:

> ""Community orchards are a brilliant way for communities to get together and grow their own. The powers we are putting in the hands of communities will make it easier to transform unloved corners of towns, cities and villages into thriving green spaces, help local people protect the orchards already there and access the land needed to establish new ones. Today's guide is about making all of that as simple and straightforward as possible and about giving a major boost to what is already a quiet revolution in promoting and preserving the nation's orchards.""

The guide includes details of the new powers in the Localism Bill that will enshrine in law a package of powerful new rights for community and voluntary groups wanting to play a bigger role in their community or takeover and preserve local assets.

Under [Right to Buy](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1973439) community groups will be first in line to bid for existing orchards or new green spaces if they come onto the market and will have the time they need to raise the necessary funds, whilst the [Right to Challenge](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1973439) could see groups taking over the running of council owned green space used for community food growing. These major new powers sit alongside further reforms like the Community right to reclaim derelict land which could see fruit trees springing up on unloved, unused plots local plots and the new [neighbourhood planning](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/neighbourhoodplanningvanguards/) powers will give communities the means to protect existing orchards and identify new plots.

Sue Clifford, co-founder of charity Common Ground - an organisation championing community orchards - says:

> ""I very much welcome this guide. It will be an important tool to help people take the first steps towards reaping the benefits of creating a community orchard. Orchards offer local people the richness of playground and pleasure garden, meeting place and festive stage.""

2. _Get the green space you want: How the Government can help_ ([www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/greenspacehelp](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/greenspacehelp)) outlines the full range of measures that the Government has in place to support communities who want to get more involved in their local community and get access to the space they need.

_Potential funding for community green spaces_ ([www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/greenspacefunding](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/greenspacefunding)) sets out the potential funding available to community and voluntary organisations for community green space initiatives. The aim is to identify the different grant schemes open to local groups, green spaces, allotment organisations or trusts, and also where to go to get help when looking for funding.

3. A wide range of organisations with an interest in promoting and preserving orchards and local green spaces have expressed their support for the 'how to' guide being published today.

**Phil Barton, Chair of the Green Flag Plus Partnership, Chief Executive of Keep Britain Tidy**:

> ""Green spaces play a vital role in improving the quality of life in local communities. They provide an important opportunity for voluntary action and many residents are actively involved in the improvement and management of their local green space, such as community orchards. We welcome this new community orchard guide as it helps encourage the growing of local foods as well as improving parks and open spaces.""

**Peter Wilkinson, Chair of the GreenSpace National Forum, GreenSpace**:

> ""Having access to quality green space should always be a high priority for local people. Community orchards being promoted through this 'how to' guide is just one of the many ways for local people to get engaged and help maintain local green space of significant importance. Green sector organisations working at the local level can offer the support people need, with this guide helping to encourage and jump-start the process.""

**Neil Canham, BTCV England Director**:

> ""Community orchards are a great way to get involved in your local community through volunteering. BTCV's association with joint running the Green Flag Award scheme has seen a year-on-year increase in the amount of community managed sites being awarded a Green Flag. Community Orchards are just one way people can take part in their local communities and I hope this guide encourages even more people to volunteer.""

**Rebecca Thompson, Website Producer at Landshare**:

> ""Britain has historically grown a wide range of wonderful varieties of apple and other tree fruit, and yet many people find themselves restricted to just a handful of supermarket-friendly varieties which have often travelled from as far away as New Zealand. Community orchards have an important role to play in preserving our natural heritage, and also bringing communities together to enjoy healthy, home-grown fruit. There is land out there, and we'd like to see more communities getting the opportunity to turn unused land into productive orchards for everyone to enjoy.""

**Jeremy Iles, Chief Executive of the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens**:

> ""Community orchards can create a unique environment, both for wildlife and for the people who spend time in them. FCFCG has been a long term supporter of community orchards - as we are of all types of community green space - and we are heartened to know that support for them is growing across the country. We hope to see many more community orchards being created over the coming years: providing a wealth of new fruit trees, delivering opportunities for people to manage their local green space, helping to preserve heritage fruit varieties, encouraging people to grow their own food and creating opportunities for volunteering and learning new skills.""

**Annemarie Naylor, Head of Assets, Locality**:

> ""Community orchards are local assets that people are keen to establish and enjoy maintaining. This guide can help put people in contact with the organisations that provide advice about community asset transfer, ownership and enterprise development in relation to such exciting community ventures.""

### Case study

4. **Horfield Organic Community Orchard, Bristol**

Started in response to the loss of traditional orchards and apple varieties, and the wish of members of the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens to grow and eat local and organic fruit, this orchard was established by local residents on an overgrown allotment in 1998. The orchard now contains over 100 apple, pear, plum and nut trees plus soft fruit and is a haven for both local people and local wildlife.

The group organises public events such as Wassail, training workshops, and an annual Apple Day celebration in October that brings in more than 300 local people. Orchard members enjoy an agreed share of the harvest, learn specialist fruit-growing skills, and have the pleasure of working and socialising with others in a green oasis in a densely populated area. The wider community benefits through open days and at events - where they can learn about growing fruit using organic methods in ways suited to urban gardens and allotments, and buy local produce.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1809662,Hertfordshire flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Hertfordshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the Hertfordshire flag today - in a ceremony also attended by Rob Gordon, Leader of Hertfordshire County Council, and Grant Shapps whose Welwyn Hatfield constituency is in the county.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Rob Gordon, Leader of Hertfordshire County Council, said:

> ""The Hertfordshire flag is an important symbol of a county that is full of contrasts - just 12 miles from London with a balance of thriving modern towns and picturesque villages set in beautiful countryside.
> 
> ""Flying the flag at the start of 2011 marks an important local anniversary, 1000 years since the first written record of Hertfordshire in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. Hertfordshire County Council is very proud to see its flag flying at the DCLG headquarters as part of the celebration of England's counties.""

Grant Shapps, MP for Welwyn Hatfield and Minister for Local Government said:

> ""Hertfordshire is a county close to my heart. It is my home county - where I was born and raised - and is home to my Parliamentary constituency of Welwyn Hatfield. Like many of its residents I associate strongly with its identity, and flying the county's flag over the Department where I am now a minister is a very proud moment. Counties have played an important part in our history and continue to feature in everyday life; I am pleased we are recognising that.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1957212,High streets get boost from fairer parking,"Centrally imposed limits on town centre parking spaces will be scrapped helping to provide a big boost to struggling high streets, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Councils that want to attract customers to local retailers and help stressed out shoppers by providing more parking can now do so without interference from central Government.

National parking restrictions set by Whitehall have until now dictated the number of parking spaces a council is permitted to grant, often with a cap that limits the spaces town centres can offer even when they want to offer more.

The new draft _National Planning Policy Framework_, recently published, will do away with these anti-car restrictions introduced in 2001 and give high streets a boost to compete for shoppers. It will encourage new investment in town centres, provide more jobs and encourage more charging spaces for electric cars.

The Government believes councils and communities are best placed to set parking policies that are right for their area and based on local need - not Whitehall. Local people know the level of parking that is sustainable for their town centre.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Families and local firms face a parking nightmare under existing rules. Stressed-out drivers have to run the gauntlet of parking fines, soaring parking charges and a lack of parking spaces. These parking restrictions have hit small shops the hardest, creating 'ghost town' high streets which can't compete with out-of-town supermarkets.
> 
> ""We want to see more parking spaces to help small shops prosper in local high streets and assist mums struggling with their family shop. We are standing up for local high streets.""

Town centres are the heart of our communities, and the Government is committed to a 'town centres first' approach. Councils should develop strategies that help their centres grow and encourage competition between retailers. New Neighbourhood Planning powers will also give communities the right to bring the kind of develop they want to their high streets.

The scrapping of parking restrictions follows a similar move earlier this year when limits on car spaces for new homes and guidance encouraging higher parking charges were abolished.

These rules unfairly penalised drivers, led to over-zealous parking enforcement, and increased unsightly on-street parking congestion - putting the safety of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians at risk.

Councils should now take into account the effect of parking charges on the vitality of their local economy and shops. Councils wanting to attract shoppers with competitive local parking charges in town centres can now do so without Whitehall interference.

Ministers believe the current planning system has become too unwieldy and complex. The draft _National Planning Policy Framework_ cuts through the red tape and condenses thousands of pages of planning guidance into one tightly focussed document.

The Framework sets out national priorities, rules only when necessary to do so, and will put more power back into the hands of local people.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1591783,HIPs are history: Pickles suspends home information packs with immediate effect,"In an important step at a point of fragile recovery in the housing market, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced that with immediate effect, they are suspending the requirement for homeowners to provide a Home Information Pack (HIP) when selling their homes.

Mr Pickles today laid an Order suspending HIPs with immediate effect, pending primary legislation for a permanent abolition. The Secretary of State has taken this swift action in order to avoid uncertainty and prevent a slump in an already fragile housing market. Today's announcement sends a clear message of encouragement to people thinking of selling their home that they can put it on the market with less cost and hassle.

HIPs are currently holding back the housing market because sellers are having to fork-out extra cash, sometimes hundreds of pounds, just to be able to put their home up for sale. Suspending HIPs will reduce the cost of selling a home, remove a layer of regulation from the process and provide a welcome help to the housing market during the recovery. It will also mean a saving for consumers to the tune of £870m over ten years, giving sellers more money in their pocket to spend in the wider economy.

Mr Pickles and Mr Shapps also said that the Government is determined to help people reduce their energy bills, improve our energy security and tackle climate change by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes. Sellers will therefore still be required to commission, but won't need to have received, an EPC before marketing their property, and the Government will consider how the EPC can play its part in the new drive for a low carbon and eco-friendly economy.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The expensive and unnecessary Home Information Pack has increased the cost and hassle of selling homes and is stifling a fragile housing market.
> 
> ""That's why I am taking emergency action to suspend the HIP, bringing down the cost of selling a home and removing unnecessary regulation from the home buying process.
> 
> ""This swift and decisive action will send a strong message to the fragile housing market and prevent uncertainty for both home sellers and buyers.
> 
> ""HIPs are history. This action will encourage sellers back into the market, and help the market as a whole and the economy recover.""

Today's move is part of delivering a key manifesto comment made by both parties in the new coalition Government. It will mean that sellers will no longer be told they have to buy a HIP before putting their home on the market, but they will now have the choice to provide one if they want to.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This is a great example of how this new Government is getting straight down to work by cutting away pointless red-tape that is strangling the market. Rather than shelling out hundreds of pounds for nothing in return we're stripping away bureaucracy and letting home owners sell their properties.
> 
> ""But we're also showing our commitment to a greener housing market by keeping Energy Performance Certificates and making them more relevant in helping buyers make informed decisions on the energy costs of their new home.""

### Notes to editors

1. Photos and video footage of the announcement will be available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/newsroom/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsroom/)

2. Home Information Packs (HIPs) put sellers of residential properties in England and Wales under a duty to provide a pack of standard information to potential buyers when marketing the property for sale.

3. The duty was introduced in three phases, depending on the size of the property, starting in August 2007 and ending in December 2007.

4. The duties relating to HIPs are set out in Part 5 of the Housing Act (sections 155 to 159). The Government has decided to suspend the HIP duties with immediate effect pending their outright abolition at the earliest opportunity.

5. The effect of this is to provide that sellers and estate agents are no longer required to have or to provide copies of HIPs with effect from 21 May 2010.

6. In order to ensure that people selling their homes continue to make an Energy Performance Certificate available to prospective buyers, we have also laid before Parliament the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 which introduce a number of new requirements including:

  * a new duty on the seller to secure that an energy performance certificate (EPC) has been commissioned before marketing of the property commences where no such certificate is already available
  * an EPC has been commissioned when a Domestic Energy Assessor has been instructed to prepare the EPC and the EPC has either been paid for or has given a clear undertaking to pay for it
  * a new duty on the person acting on behalf of the seller to be satisfied that an EPC has been commissioned before commencing marketing
  * a new duty on both the seller and a person acting on their behalf to make reasonable efforts to secure an EPC within 28 days
  * all of the new duties carry fixed penalties where somebody fails in the duty conferred on them by the new regulations

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2067647,Historic powers in the Localism Act pass down to communities,"A host of new powers to put communities back in charge of their own affairs has become a reality as the Coalition Government's localism agenda takes another major step forward.

The Localism Act, which received Royal Assent in November 2011, takes power from central government and hands it back to local authorities and communities - giving them the freedom and flexibility to achieve their own ambitions.

Exactly two months on from Royal Assent of the Act, a parliamentary measure, known as a commencement order, has officially brought into effect much of this flagship legislation, handing new powers to communities and officially wiping from the law books measures that ministers deemed unnecessary and unpopular bureaucratic interferences.

The key new measures to hand back control, include:

  * Increased accountability on local pay: councils are now required to publish their pay policies and put the policies that underpin senior pay packets to a full council vote opening up how public money is being spent in the area to local people.
  * Preparations for HomeSwap Direct: the national home swap scheme that will take full effect in April 2012, enabling people to swap their social home more easily, for example because they wish to move jobs.
  * Reform of social housing regulation: initial legislative preparations for the formal implementation of changes due on 1 April 2012, which will give social landlords greater freedom to meet local needs and tenants stronger tools to hold landlords to account. Changes to the way complaints are managed will follow in 2013.
  * Freeing Cities: gives the means to transfer of powers from central Government and non-departmental public bodies to local authorities for improved accountability and economic growth.
  * New planning enforcement rules: a first step in the process to give councils the ability to take action against people who deliberately conceal unauthorised development in preparation for commencement of the substantive provisions in April 2012.

Measures to scrap bureaucratic red tape, include:

  * Bin Taxes are now officially consigned to the scrapheap of history. These provisions would have charged families, on top of council tax, for emptying their bins - and would have fuelled fly-tipping and backyard burning.
  * Home Information Packs have been officially removed from the statute books freeing those who wish to sell their home from this costly red tape.
  * The rules on predetermination have been clarified freeing councillors to express their opinions on issues of local importance without the fear of legal challenge.
  * Councils can now move to a committee system of governance, if they wish, regardless of their size.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Today is a major landmark in the Government's unrelenting drive to hand power back to where it belongs - in the hands of citizens, community groups and local councils.
> 
> ""The new rights and powers coming into force will begin to put communities firmly back in control of their own destiny, and reverse a 100 years of Government centralisation by breaking down the Whitehall barricades and removing a raft of unnecessary bureaucratic regulations. This marks another shift away from the central government monopoly over public policy.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November 2011. Certain provisions came into effect immediately or through the first Commencement Order on 3 December 2011. The Second Commencement order came into effect on 15 January 2012, two months after Royal Assent, bringing into effect a number of new measures and powers. The second commencement order can be read in full here: [www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/57/contents/made](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/57/contents/made).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1826953,Holocaust Memorial Day: Eric Pickles pays tribute and promotes participation,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today took part in the national Holocaust Memorial Day event to pay tribute to those affected by genocide past and present.

Speaking today (Thursday 27 January 2011) at the event to mark the annual day of remembrance and awareness-raising, the Secretary of State emphasised how important it is that everyone has the chance to learn about the events of the Holocaust and to understand its pertinence to our lives today. Despite the challenging state of public finances, he was also able to confirm that Government support for local memorial activities would continue.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Holocaust Memorial Day gives us an opportunity to find out more about what happened in Nazi Germany, Bosnia, Cambodia, Rwanda and Darfur; to look at why it happened; and to think about what we all need to do to make sure it never happens again. This day is relevant to all of us.
> 
> ""Antisemitism and other forms of bigotry have sadly not yet been relegated to the history books. It's the responsibility of every one of us to challenge divisive views and discrimination whenever we see them.
> 
> ""Holocaust Memorial Day is such an important focus for motivating people to do their bit to ensure that the horrendous crimes committed during the Holocaust are remembered and never repeated. This is why we have decided to continue to provide funding to support the crucial work of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.
> 
> ""Formal events, such as I attended today, are a chance to stop and remember the horrific genocides of this century. But the many local events taking place this week, in whatever form they take, provide even more important opportunities for the whole community to get involved. They rightly focus on education, young people, thought-provoking stories and active engagement with the modern day issues.""

The Government supports the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust to supply resources for teachers and for the organisers of the hundreds of local events that take place in communities.

Carly Whyborn, Chief Executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, commented:

> ""Hundreds of events are taking place up and down the country today to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. The Day gives us the opportunity to not just learn about history but to learn from history. We hope people will see the day as an opportunity to think about what action they can take that will have a positive impact on their community.
> 
> ""Today's confirmation of funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government is welcomed by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and will enable us to continue our important work in supporting Holocaust Memorial Day event organisers and helping create a safer and better future, free from the dangers of discrimination and exclusion.""

The Government has shown its commitment to tackling antisemitism and discrimination, with:

  * £2 million for increasing security for Jewish faith schools, announced by the Department for Education in December last year;
  * a requirement for police forces to record antisemitic hate crimes separately, with the first set of data released last November. This will improve data and make it easier to target security measures;
  * and, to ensure continued progress on tackling hate crime, including antisemitism, on the internet, Ministers will host a seminar this spring.

The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust is encouraging people to visit their website and light a virtual candle to show their support. The site includes an array of free resources and information as well as details of events taking place in every region.

### Notes to editors

  1. On Holocaust Memorial Day, the victims and survivors of the Holocaust and those from subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and the ongoing atrocities in Darfur are remembered. It has taken place in the UK since 2001 and in 2005 the United Nations designated 27 January as International Holocaust Memorial Day. The date was chosen as the anniversary of the day in 1945 on which the largest Nazi concentration camp (Auschwitz-Birkenau) was liberated.
  2. The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust is an independent charitable organisation, set up specifically for the purpose of running Holocaust Memorial Day ([www.hmd.org.uk](http://www.hmd.org.uk/)). Their website lists some of the hundreds of local events taking place, which are supported by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.
  3. On 13 December 2010, the Government published a report on the progress that's been made and measures that will be taken to tackle antisemitism, four years on from the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2094218,Homelessness experts back 'Before You Go' information campaign,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today backed a new pilot to tackle the increase of people from Central and Eastern Europe becoming homeless on England's streets.

The Before You Go campaign, run by the Passage in partnership with Thames Reach and Homeless Link, will aim to reach people in their home countries before they leave for British shores and make them aware of the dangers of coming to the UK without appropriate support in place before.

Chief Executive at The Passage Mick Clarke said:

> ""At the Passage our street outreach team is out on the streets seven nights a week, every night of the year, to help people have a way off those streets and out of homelessness. We are also determined to do all we can to prevent people ending up on the streets in the first instance, and this includes economic migrants who can be exploited and put at risk because they have not been able to prepare properly before leaving home. Having a job secured, with secure accommodation in place, and ensuring that your travel arrangements are organised by a reputable company can be the difference between successful migration and ending up sleeping on the streets.
> 
> ""The Passage is therefore proud to be leading on the Before You Go pilot that will help people considering travelling to the UK for employment to make an informed choice and not end up on the streets, destitute and at risk.""

Audrey Mitchell, Director of Street and Hostel Services at Thames Reach said:

> ""Thames Reach welcomes the Minister's announcement about resources to help rough sleepers. As an organisation engaging with vulnerable non UK nationals on the streets every day we see firsthand the danger and hopelessness they suffer through being ill-prepared for living and working here. Working closely with support agencies and the media in many EU countries, as well as embassies here, we are constantly highlighting the need for being prepared and informed about working in London before coming over. Through our London Reconnections service we have supported over 1500 rough sleepers to return to their homes in the EU where they can access support and be reunited with families.""

The Combined Homelessness and Information Network, run by Broadway, estimates that in London alone there has been a 20 per cent increase in rough sleepers from Central and Eastern Europe in the last two years.

Howard Sinclair from Broadway said:

> ""At our day centre in Hammersmith we see a great many people from all over the world. Often they have come here because they want a better life but things haven't worked out. What we know is that people are better off being assisted to return to friends, family and areas they know than isolated, vulnerable and sleeping on the streets of London.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1685698,Homeowners at risk must seek early help,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today issued a reminder to struggling homeowners to seek help early to have a better chance of staying in their homes.

His call came on the day new research from the Centre of Housing Policy at the University of York shows that the number of home owners who have given up their home due to financial difficulties has been much higher than solely shown by repossession statistics.

The research shows that whilst thousands have lost their home through voluntary or compulsory repossession, many more people have been forced into selling their home, before any court action is taken against them because of financial difficulties.

### CML repossession figures fall

The findings come as new figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) released today show that repossessions in the second quarter of 2010 were down by 400 compared to the previous quarter, and 20 per cent less than the same time in 2009.

CML have also today confirmed that they are revising down their original forecast for the number of households being repossessed in 2010 from 53,000 to 40,000.

Mr Pickles said that whilst the fall in the number of people losing their homes through official repossession action was welcome, the research demonstrated that many more homeowners had fallen victim to losing their home than is shown up in repossession statistics. He said that the findings strongly underlined the need for early action from homeowners to get help, take control of their finances and give themselves the best chance of avoiding losing their homes.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Today's figures from CML are good news and an encouraging sign that fewer homeowners are facing the real and frightening prospect of repossession. But there is no room for complacency - struggling homeowners must take early advice to have the best chance of staying in their homes.
> 
> ""I am determined that those who need help are able to get it - and that includes the need to tackle the record budget deficit to avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates.
> 
> ""Today's research lays bare the many hidden victims of the recent recession, homeowners who have given up and left home ownership, when getting practical advice before matters got too overwhelming might have kept them in their homes. That's why we are working with organisations like Shelter and Citizens Advice so people know where they can go to get a grip on their finances and can make informed decisions about their future.""

_HomeSwap Direct_ will mean that for the first time there will be a system in place across the whole of the UK, meaning that tenants looking to move, whether for a job, to be near family or to a property better suited to their needs, will be able to see all the available homes across the whole of the UK, not just those on the website subscribed to by their current landlord.

Some councils such as Kettering already run localised schemes but _Homeswap Direct_ will link them all together across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.

One couple that have already benefited from moving home through a homeswap scheme are Terry and Catherine McGrath of Welwyn Hatfield. Their family moved to Lincoln meaning a visit meant a 250 mile round trip, which they did every few weeks. After hearing about Homeswapper they decided to see if they could find a home closer to the family.

Terry McGrath said:

> ""It took us less than three months to find our perfect swap in Lincoln. We could have moved sooner but we wanted to make sure the house was perfect as we knew once we had moved closer to the children we would settle there.
> 
> ""Our new home is very similar to the bungalow we loved in Welwyn Hatfield but has a very important added benefit; our family are now just around the corner Without HomeSwapper it could have taken years for us to have been moved nearer to our family, it's easy and simple and we'd recommend it to anyone looking to move.""

The review of regulations will reflect the approach taken in the Housing Strategy published in November last year. The Strategy outlines how the Government is committed to better environmental standards, more affordable housing, security of tenure, legal protection for tenants and leaseholders, and support for the elderly, vulnerable households and those on low incomes.

The Government has already taken a series of steps to cut unnecessary red tape, including abolishing Home Information Packs, reducing burdens on short-term holiday lets, removing blanket regulation on Houses of Multiple Occupation that would have reduced choice for tenants, and introduced new freedoms and flexibilities for social landlords via the Localism Act. This review will help inform the scope for further reductions of unnecessary and disproportionate red tape.

The Sector Champions will be supporting the review by using their experience and industry contacts to help shine the spotlight on our Red Tape Challenge theme.

Simon Randall CBE is a solicitor specialising in housing and also has a strong background in local government having served as a Councillor and through his work with Housing Associations such as chairing Broomleigh Housing Association. In his spare time, he is also actively involved in supporting mutuals and co-operatives.

Stephen Greenhalgh is Councillor for Town Ward in Fulham and Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council. He has extensive experience of the local government and housing sector. He is a successful entrepreneur and, as a landlord himself also understands the business perspective.

Both champions are keen to be involved in the Red Tape Challenge and to support the Department.

Simon Randall said:

> ""The housing and construction sectors are arguably the most highly regulated in the UK. There is enormous scope for reducing red tape which could both increase and speed up the supply of private rented and social housing without in any way compromising on quality, security or sustainability. This will be the overall challenge for the sectors and I look forward to their suggestions for abolition or simplification of existing regulations.""

> ""The Berkeley Group welcomes this innovative initiative which will enable people who can afford the ongoing cost, but not the high upfront deposit required by today's market, to acquire a new-build home. As important is the stimulus to the wider economy. A strong housing market creates jobs and is such an integral part of consumer confidence for the UK. It is also a fantastic example of Government and the private sector working together to find solutions to today's market challenges.""

**Stewart Baseley, Executive Chairman of the Home Builders Federation**, welcomed the new build indemnity scheme. He said:

> ""In recent years many people have been unable to realise their dreams of buying a home because of the huge deposits required by lenders. This scheme will allow people to buy their new home on realistic terms and help in particular hard-pressed first time buyers.
> 
> ""It will also be a huge boost to house building. Since 2007, the biggest constraint on homes being built has been mortgage availability. This scheme will see more desperately needed homes being built, create jobs and give the economy the boost it needs.""

**Nick Jopling, Executive Property Director of residential landlord Grainger**, said:

> ""Today's surprise £400 million announcement to boost housing supply is a welcome shot in the arm for the housing sector and the UK economy as a whole. While it isn't the full answer to the UK's housing crisis, alongside the other measures expected in the national housing strategy, it will go some way to easing the chronic shortage of housing facing this country.""

**Stephen Stone, Chief Executive at housebuilder Crest Nicholson**, said:

> ""We have an acute housing crisis in this country and the long term undersupply of new homes has been severely aggravated by the recession. A healthy housing market is critical to the success of the economy, but restrictions to the mortgage market in the last few years have significantly hindered the rate of recovery.
> 
> ""The Government's proposed support of a mortgage indemnity scheme will give a vital boost to the market, doing much to unlock the funding restrictions facing the sector. The plans will be very much welcomed by the industry, and the expectation that such a scheme will generate a significant uplift in new home production is hugely encouraging.""

**Mark Clare, Chief Executive of Barratt Developments PLC**, said:

> ""This is exactly what the industry needs to ensure that customers can buy and we can build the homes the nation so desperately needs. Lack of mortgage finance is the single biggest issue we face and I'm confident that we can increase production to meet the very clear demand that exists for more homes.""

**RIBA Chief Executive, Harry Rich,** said:

> ""We have been pressing hard for more homes to be built in the UK and for these to be of high design quality. I am delighted that the government has listened and has given such prominence to design quality and the role of architects in driving good design within their communities and in delivering housing fit for the 21st century.""

**Andy Yallop, Group Chief Executive, Croudace Homes** said:

> ""House builders operate in a highly competitive market place and can only invest in land and future production if there is mortgage finance available for its customers. This new initiative will allow the many people who aspire to buy a new home to do so, something that has been impossible for many for the last three years. It will enable us to increase our future production and thereby increase the number of people employed.""

**Paul Smee, Council of Mortgage Lenders Director General**, on the new build indemnity scheme, said:

> ""This scheme is good news for home-buyers, developers and indeed the UK economy. Lenders will be able to reduce the level of deposit needed by home-buyers in the new build sector, enabling more buyers to buy and so supporting the flow of new housing development, with all its positive consequences for jobs and the economy as a whole.""

**Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the Town and Country Planning Association**, said:

> ""We welcome the Government's pledge to provide more support for locally planned large scale development, where there is community support and private sector appetite, through the planning system and infrastructure prioritisation. A new generation of locally-led, comprehensively planned garden communities - including sustainable urban extensions, urban villages and new settlements - is overdue.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1849745,Housing Minister Grant Shapps responds to an article about housebuilding in the Financial Times,"### Homes posturing ignores reforms

From Grant Shapps MP.

Sir, The National Housing Federation is once again true to form with its cynical posturing on the future of housing supply. But as ever, it is only painting a partial picture of the radical reforms that will boost the provision of affordable homes across the entire country (""Cheaper property blow for Midlands and north"", Financial Times, February 18).

We do not recognise these figures from the NHF - indeed it is meaningless for it to speculate on how many homes will be built in different parts of the country before the Homes and Communities Agency has received or agreed a single bid for funding from housing associations. Its analysis also chooses to ignore many of the reforms that will improve the provision of affordable housing across the country.

Affordable rent is only one of the options for generating extra investment for new homes. Providers also have the flexibility to use a wide variety of funding, including surpluses from existing rental income and revenue from sales and shared ownership, as well as contributions through the planning system. Strengthened powers to utilise public sector land, and extra funding for affordable homes through the new homes bonus, including for bringing empty homes back into use, will also give providers extra tools to deliver the affordable homes people need, where they are needed.

Housing associations have a long history of delivering innovative solutions to provide affordable homes, and I have every confidence that they will continue to use this expertise and the full range of these reforms, working closely with councils, to build more affordable homes in every part of the country.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/2010586,Housing Minister Grant Shapps responds to article in the Daily Mail on the new HomeSwap Direct scheme,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps responds to Janet Street Porter article in Daily Mail suggesting that HomeSwap Direct will not be effective.

Dear Sir

Janet Street Porter has misunderstood some key facts about HomeSwap Direct (Swap homes to find a job? On your bike!, 17 October 2011) - and is clearly one of those people who, crazily, don't want council tenants to have the same life opportunities as everyone else.

Currently there are several mutual exchange schemes, but they don't talk to each other so there are no means of seeing all available properties. Instead, tenants who want to move house have their choices restricted by who their landlord is, and which home swap scheme they have signed up to. HomeSwap Direct will change that, for the first time creating a joined-up national scheme so that tenants can see potential swaps from across the country.

This move will help shake up the lazy consensus that traps people in the social housing system, and means council tenants often don't have the same life opportunities as everyone else. Instead of confining people wanting to move to the back of the queue, it will once and for all put their future in their hands and make the most of the job opportunities that council tenants want to take.

I find it extraordinary that anyone would want to deny council tenants wanting to move, whether for jobs or to be closer to family, the opportunity to do so.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/1825375,Housing Minister Grant Shapps responds to Guardian article about Supporting People funding,"### The Government is protecting the homeless from council cuts

By suggesting that reductions in council budgets will ""wreak devastation on the lives of tens of thousands of the most vulnerable people"", Patrick Butler paints an apocalyptic picture of impending social disaster that I simply do not recognise (see 'On other sites' top right).

Tackling homelessness is what first got me into politics, and I am proud to be part of a government that, despite tight public finances, has committed to support the most vulnerable in this country. We've entirely protected homelessness funding at £400m in the spending review, and took deliberate steps to protect this central funding so that the impact of cuts do not fall on those most in need. So I completely disagree when Butler says that councils ""have no choice but to drastically cut Supporting People, given the reduced size…of the wider financial settlement"".

The Supporting People housing programme was relatively shielded from the public sector spending reductions - so, nationally, for every pound Supporting People funding provided last year, 99 pence will be provided this year. And this government didn't remove the ringfence - that was done in April 2009.

Local authorities on average will only receive a reduction in their overall spending power of 4.4 per cent this year, and we have taken steps to cap the maximum reduction for any individual council at 8.9 per cent to protect those dependent on government grants.

Of course, I won't insist on how much ""each council ought to spend on Supporting People"" as Butler suggests I do, because councils are best placed to know local needs and how to meet them. So there is no excuse for councils to be targeting any disproportionate spending reductions on programmes that support the most vulnerable.

There are, as Butler says, ""complex health and social issues that derive from or are intensified by having nowhere to live"". That's why in opposition I founded the Conservative Homelessness Foundation, and set up the Ministerial Working Group on Homelessness as soon as we got into government. This is a long-term commitment to work closely with colleagues across government and the charitable sector to better tackle the myriad issues that contribute to homelessness and rough sleeping and to strip away barriers and bureaucracy at the local level.

So I completely disagree with Butler's assertion that the effect of the funding settlement for councils ""will be there to see on our streets"". If I thought this would in any way increase homelessness and rough sleeping, I certainly would not support the moves we are making to ensure every taxpayer's pound is spent more wisely.

In government we've made tough decisions to ensure that funding is focused on protecting key frontline services. But I absolutely dispute the view from one council mentioned in Butler's piece that they see ""absolutely no reason…to spend the [Supporting People] money on supporting vulnerable citizens in this way"". While we recognise the challenges councils are facing, we do expect to see them match our commitment to the most vulnerable.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/2005340,Housing Minister Grant Shapps responds to New Homes Bonus 'bribe' claim,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps responds to an article in the Daily Mail which describes the New Homes Bonus as a bribe for communities to accept new homes being built on Green Belt land.

Dear Sir

It is absolute nonsense to describe the New Homes Bonus as a ""bribe"" (£1bn 'bribes' for councils to build on green sites, 10 October). Instead, the New Homes Bonus ensures that for the first time communities start to see significant benefits from housing development and growth in their area.

For too long, a top-down, centralised system of housing targets pitted communities against developers. It left local people, who best know their neighbourhoods and the pressures they face, without a voice and unable to offer their views on where homes should be built, and how many their area could accommodate.  Housebuilding fell to its lowest levels for any peacetime year since 1924 and house prices doubled in the decade from 1997 - leaving increasing numbers of people unable to get a foothold on the property ladder.

But the changes we're making to the planning system will give residents a much greater say over the future development of their local area, including protecting local green spaces and the Green Belt. And where homes are built, it is right that local people share in the prosperity and growth that this will bring to their community.

New Homes Bonus funding can be used however communities see fit to improve their local area - and I would urge all councils expecting to receive funding to speak to their residents about how they would like to see it spent locally.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1608032,How 'Fabio' is your footie food?,"Do you know the score when you order takeaway?

With England's World Cup campaign due to kick off this Saturday millions of England fans are expected to settle down in front of a big screen TV with their takeaway or pub grub without knowing how clean the kitchen that made it is.

Ministers are urging councils to expose the official food hygiene ratings for every fast-food outlet, pub or restaurant in Britain. Every year councils inspect thousands of food outlets but the information is not always made easily available.

As part of the new Coalition Government's pledge to open up officially held information, ministers want people to be able to see at the touch of a button whether their favourite takeaway is up to the mark or falling short.

Under The Food Safety Act 1990 any establishment making food is routinely inspected every six months to three years, but so far just ninety four councils routinely release that data through the [www.scoresonthedoors.org.uk](http://www.scoresonthedoors.org.uk/) (external link) website but the data isn't necessarily openly available for use even then. Now ministers are encouraging every council to share what they know about food outlets in an open-data format that could be used by third-party websites or to create an iPhone app to help fans decide where find 'top-notch footie-food'.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""With England's World Cup kicking off on Saturday, takeaway orders will go through the roof. In future it should be possible to quickly and easily check the food hygiene record of your favourite 'chippy' or pizza delivery service from your mobile phone without even leaving the sofa. This is data which is already collected, but by making it freely available the so called 'wisdom of crowds' could drive hygiene standards much higher.
> 
> ""Nowadays people who book a family holiday are used to checking on sites like Trip Advisor to find out what others thought of their hotel. If councils now release their food hygiene information in an open-data format then restaurant reviews could routinely reference it. Nothing would do more to drive up hygiene standards than shining a bright light on this information which is already gathered.""

Ninety four councils have already worked with the Food Standards Agency _Scores on the Doors_ scheme to get reports online. Ministers are urging all councils to do the same and for that data to be more open to other services like popular phone based applications including Google Maps which already provides user restaurant reviews, but could in the future easily include hygiene rating information too.

Councils are being encouraged to go further by throwing open all their files. The idea is that if information is subject to Freedom of Information it is information that should be provided for free.

Mr Shapps is calling for councils to think right across the piece. Not presuming to know what people need to see but letting local people decide for themselves.

### Notes to Editors

1. _Scores on the Doors_ already lists over 100,000 premises and gets around 50,000 requests a month via text or internet for council hygiene star ratings. Ministers are urging that the data be opened up so that third-parties can include the information alongside restaurant reviews online and on iPhone style apps.

2. The move comes as part of Communities Secretary Eric Pickles' new drive for greater transparency in town hall openness accountability, where councils are being encouraged to publish details of all spending over £500 in full and online.

3. Councils are being encouraged to throw open their files and alongside spending info, publish a wide range of data online including:

  * information on senior salaries, names and job descriptions;
  * councillor allowances and expenses;
  * minutes and papers of council meetings;
  * job vacancies that will enable people to see why council wage bills are so high and how many of the positions are for key local services;
  * frontline service data - including rubbish and recycling rates, council tax collection rates and detail of major planned projects;
  * data such as food hygiene reports for food outlets - information which is routinely collected and of interest to residents, but not currently shared in an easily accessible format.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1904949,How will councils spend your £53 billion this year?,"Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles, today published new figures showing exactly how much town halls have to spend for each resident. He encouraged local taxpayers to go compare and ask how their money is being spent this year.

![Heat map of the UK showing revenue spending power per head, 2011-12](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1904928.jpg)Revenue Spending Power per head, 2011-12  
- [Full size map](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/pdf/1904897.pdf) (pdf, 1330 kb)

The average spending figure is equivalent to councils spending over £1,000 for every resident in their area.

The new figures and 'spending heat map' reveal councils' revenue spending across England will be almost £53 billion this year to spend on services, despite the need to reduce the inherited budget deficit.

Almost a quarter (78) of councils covering 37 per cent of the population - including Newcastle, Wolverhampton, Torbay and Liverpool - have over £1,000 for every resident living in their boundaries.

The overall figures for revenue spending power per resident for the current year (2011-12) shows 19 per cent (63) of councils receive over £1,050 per resident, 62 per cent (200) receive between £830 and £1,050 and only 19 per cent (63) receive below £830.

The Government has already published similar maps showing the council tax per head contribution and how much councils receive in central government grant per head.  
Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The public knows that councils - and indeed central government - can deliver far better for value money. It's not how much you spend, but how you spend it.
> 
> ""This is not to say that making the savings to council budgets won't be challenging for councillors and council officers. It's very easy to salami-slice budgets or cut the frontline first. But that's the easy option. It's harder - but better - to deliver transformational change, finding new ways of working. Transparency is at that heart of that process.""

On the spending figures, he added:

> ""Despite the need to pay off the budget deficit, councils are spending £53 billion this year, equivalent to an average of £1,000 for every man, woman and child. Local taxpayers should now go compare and check they are receiving value for money for the spend they get.
> 
> ""The poorest areas receive the most money. But some of the councils with the best services receive the least. Whether you live in north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire, what people want to see is value for money.""

### Note for editors

1. Two of the main sources of council revenue are:

  * Council tax, which accounts for quarter of all revenue. Council tax varies according to the property values of each area - with more affluent areas and bigger homes paying more. The Government helped councils freeze council tax this year. It has also ruled out a council tax revaluation in this Parliament, as it could have meant soaring bills for millions for homes. In the 2005 revaluation in Wales, four times as many homes moved up one or more bands as down.
  * A complex central government formula, which fairly distributes £29.4 billion in grant. February's Local Government Finance Settlement was structured so areas most dependant on formula grant received the lion's share of that central government funding while those collecting more council tax tended to receive less. This creates a fairer system between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire.

2. £52.7 billion of council revenue around the country is distributed per head of population to give a national average (using the England figure of 51,809,741) of £1017. The overall spending power figures were published in January 2011.

Support will also be given to 164 existing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) over the next two years.

Business Support in the North East will allow Local Enterprise Agencies to offer a portfolio of support including hands on support from an Enterprise Coach, an intensive two-day 'Boot camp' comprising workshops and one-to-one mentoring as well as support to understand the access to finances.

This support for emerging pre-start businesses, including high growth businesses, will ensure they reach their full potential and contribute towards economic rebalancing in the North East.

The project is funded by a variety of sources including £1.06m from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Working in a consortium led by North East Enterprise Agencies Ltd (NEEAL) local Enterprise and Development Agencies in the North East have matched this investment with £1.06m of their own funds.

Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:

> ""A significant number of new businesses and new jobs will be created as a direct result of this project ensuring pre-start businesses can harness their full economic potential. Entrepreneurs from communities in all parts of the North East from North Northumberland to the Tees Valley will have access to this excellent business support programme that offers a real chance to make a difference.
> 
> ""Private sector growth is vital to a strong economy, particularly in the small and medium enterprise sectors, and this project will play an important role in strengthening the North East's business base contributing to the growth of the local and national economy.""

Business Support in the North East will ensure that individuals from a variety of backgrounds - with or without experience in enterprise - receive all the required knowledge to successfully establish a business and in doing so, contribute to the North East fulfilling its economic potential. Through local coherent support the project will also help ensure that small businesses seeking support receive the correct guidance to prevent the business from failing.

There are various offers of help available through the project including Enterprise Coaching, Starting a High Growth Business and Understanding Finance for Business, together ensuring businesses are fully equipped for success.

Support through Enterprise Coaching will focus on intensive awareness raising activities followed by intensive hands on support from an experienced and qualified Enterprise Coach, targeting people in employment who possess the skills and resources to start a business and/or those who may be at threat of redundancy, as well as underrepresented groups and disadvantaged areas.

Starting a High Growth Business package of support will provide an intensive two day 'Boot Camp' comprising workshops and one-to-one mentoring to develop the business plan and idea.

Understanding Finance for Business incorporates support from pre-start stage through to full business establishment ensuring businesses are equipped with knowledge regarding accessing loan funds and when to engage with others for financial help.

NEEAL was established in 2007 as a consortium comprising the Enterprise and Development Agencies of the North East, all of whom are non-profit organisations providing enterprise support throughout the region. Based at over twenty different locations across the North East, NEEAL has delivered a wide range of publicly funded projects that have contributed to the economic growth of the North East.

Chairman of NEEAL, Paul McEldon said:

> ""I am delighted that we have secured the funding for this hugely important work. This funding will enable us to establish a regional and fully cohesive offering for potential business start ups across the region. This will ensure accessible and high quality business support is available to anyone considering starting a business which, given the uncertain environment and the importance of rebalancing the North East economy, is fantastic news for the North East as a whole.""

The ERDF Competitiveness Programme 2007-13 is bringing over £300m into North East England to support innovation, enterprise and business support. It will help create and safeguard 28,000 new jobs, start 3,000 new businesses and increase the region's productivity by £1.1bn per annum.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Rupert Barnes, the Vice-Chairman of The Huntingdonshire Society said:

> ""Huntingdonshire has a great deal to celebrate. It is a county of matchless beauty and charm, of pretty villages, broad green fields and ancient towns dipping their feet in the quiet river. It is little known outside its borders but loved by its folk.
> 
> ""Oliver Cromwell, born this week in 1599, showed that a man of Huntingdonshire can, for good or ill, rise to the highest. Many other men and women of this county too have by endeavour made their mark on the nation or their own communities. Such men as Samuel Pepys, the Earl of Sandwich and Henry Royce were content with nothing but the very finest of their endeavours, coming perhaps from the best of the shires.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1601983,Immediate halt on 'ports tax',"Emergency regulations are being introduced today to put a halt on demands for unfair, retrospective business rate payments affecting ports, announced Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles.

Many ports companies have been facing huge backdated business rates bills reaching into the millions after changes to the way rates were calculated in 2008 by the Valuation Office Agency.

As an urgent first step, the new regulations will suspend unexpected backdated business rate payments, including for port companies, giving a lifeline to struggling firms and supporting a vital part of Britain's manufacturing industry.

The payment freeze will be funded from the £6billion public sector savings announced by the Chief Secretary on Monday.

In addition, the Government will pledge to continue to explore options up to and including primary legislation to offer ports companies permanent relief from backdated bills.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Backdated port taxes levied on a vital part of Britain's export industry have left many businesses unfairly facing hefty bills, reaching into the millions in some cases.
> 
> ""Today I am introducing a suspension of the collection of this ports tax grab, offering immediate help to firms struggling because of this unfair, unjust tax.
> 
> ""I will not allow Government to idly look on any longer as vital businesses stare into the face of insolvency as a result of the ports tax, and today we're making good on our promise to act.
> 
> ""We are clear we should be supporting the economy not forcing people out of business.""

Local Government Minister Bob Neill added:

> ""It is vital to the nation that we set things right and stop this nonsensical situation affecting the livelihoods of thousands.
> 
> ""This payments freeze is an urgent first step that will mean struggling firms have one less thing to worry about in these difficult times, and we will continue to work towards a sensible and fair long term solution.""

### Notes to Editors

  1. Backdated business rate demands were issued to many port businesses following a ports review completed by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) in 2008.
  2. The Government is taking this step as it is aware that certain backdated business rates bills have come during a difficult economic period, and concerns have been expressed particularly about the potential impact on some businesses located in ports.
  3. Backdating is a general part of the rating system and businesses other than those based in ports would have received backdated rates liabilities in 2008 as well. Hence the freeze is available to all ratepayers that meet the criteria.
  4. The freeze applies to businesses liable for backdated business rates where bills are subject to the 8-year schedule of payments. Businesses can contact their local billing authority to check eligibility.

> ""boost housing market confidence and support the flow of new housing"".

Moray McDonald, Mortgages Director for NatWest expressed the hope that increased demand from the scheme:

> ""will help lift the economy via the construction of additional homes"".

And Andrew Baddeley-Chappell, Head of Mortgage Strategy and Policy at Nationwide, said that NewBuy will:

> ""boost the supply of properties and provide affordable mortgages to those with more modest deposits, including first time buyers"".

### Backed by builders

With the NewBuy Guarantee set to support up to 50,000 new jobs, major housebuilders have given their backing to the scheme, which is available only on newly-built properties.

Chief executive at Taylor Wimpey, Pete Redfern, said the NewBuy Guarantee will:

> ""go a long way in helping a wide range of buyers who have had to put their dreams of getting on or moving up the property ladder on hold"".
> 
> ""Availability of affordable mortgages is so often cited by our customers as their main barrier to purchase,"" he added.
> 
> ""Increasing the number of 95 per cent mortgages being offered by lenders should have a significant positive impact on the market.""

Bovis Homes chief executive David Ritchie agreed, saying the need for aspiring homeowners to get much larger deposits together had:

> ""undoubtedly been a significant factor in slowing down the market"".
> 
> ""We want to hit the ground running with NewBuy and there is a real level of commitment among housebuilders, lenders and Government to make it work for the country's homebuyers,"" he said.
> 
> ""This new five per cent deposit requirement promises to give the market a major boost - especially as it is available to existing homeowners and first-time buyers alike.""

Ian Baker of Linden Homes highlighted the demand for new homes, with ""record numbers"" of people visiting the company's sites across the country. He said:

> ""Buyers are telling us that mortgages remain difficult to obtain. And it's not just first time buyers saying this - many existing homeowners are struggling to move into a new home due to a lack of equity in their properties due to a downturn in valuations. We believe NewBuy will further extend a helping hand to people struggling to get onto or step up the property ladder, and its visibility will help to provide buyers with the confidence they had pre-recession that responsible lending is attainable.""

### Support from small and medium sized builders

Over the next few weeks it is expected that a number of smaller developers will be able to offer NewBuy mortgages on a range of sites across the country, alongside the largest housebuilding firms.

These developers have also expressed their support for the scheme as a measure designed not just to help buyers, but also to get Britain building again.

They include Andy Yallop, chief executive at Croudace Homes in Surrey and Hertfordshire, who warned that the constrained mortgage market had had:

> ""an adverse effect both upon our business and the many who wish to buy one of our new homes.""

He described NewBuy as:

> ""an exciting opportunity for us to work together with Government and lenders to unlock the situation, thereby enabling us to provide more new homes to the benefit of both those who wish to buy and those whose jobs it is to build them"".

Mark Connors, managing director at Shepherd Homes in Yorkshire, said it will:

> ""enable our company to create local jobs and give a lift to the area's local economy"", as well as offering;
> 
> ""the opportunity for families to meet their aspirations and own a new home"".

And Ken Whitaker, managing director of Seddon Homes which covers much of Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, said:

> ""The flexible nature of the scheme and the way it can be accessed across a range of sites will maximise its impact and generate new activity right across the country.""
> 
> ""As a regional housebuilder this will enable us to build and sell more houses on our patch, generating work and economic activity which will have a direct impact on local jobs and prosperity.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1800616,It only takes a minute for Christmas to go up in smoke,"Shocking fire safety footage on YouTube shows just how quickly festive celebrations could go up in smoke this Christmas. As new statistics show that injuries and deaths from accidental fires peaked in December 2008, this footage hammers home the reality of increased fire risk over the festive season.

The one-minute video counts the seconds as a house fire sparked by faulty fairy lights takes hold, reminding people just how little time they have to escape should a fire break out.

Many people are unaware of the potential fire hazards and toxic threats that can lurk in fairy lights, candles and flammable Christmas decorations. Latest figures from the Fire Kills campaign show a rise in the number of accidental fire deaths and injuries over the festive period.

As a result Fire and Rescue Services across the country are urging people to take extra care as they get into the festive spirit this Christmas - dry Christmas trees, decorations and wrapped presents can all provide means for a fire to spread in the home.

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Everyone enjoys the festive cheer that a Christmas tree and decorations can bring to a home. But the sad fact is that all this can act as extra fuel for a potential house fire. Unsafe electrical decorations, overloaded plugs and unattended candles are all potential causes of fire.
> 
> ""Just two to three breaths of toxic smoke from a fire can render a person unconscious and you have less time to escape than you think. It only takes a minute for festive celebrations to go up in smoke, so I urge everyone to be fire safe this year and have a great Christmas.""

Tina Hencher, a mother of four from Derby and her family were made homeless over Christmas 2008 after a house fire destroyed their home. Heavily pregnant at the time, she was woken by her smoke alarm at three in the morning to find the front room in flames.

The family lost all their belongings, including invaluable family photos, and the fire caused so much damage that it was impossible to tell whether it was caused by a power socket overloaded with Christmas lights or a tea light candle.

Mrs Hencher said:

> ""There hasn't been a candle in our house since the fire and we didn't have Christmas lights last year, though now we're using battery-powered ones that were given the green light by the Fire and Rescue Service. I now take every day as a gift; if it wasn't for the smoke alarm we would have died. We've installed a second smoke alarm downstairs, both are now attached to the mains, and I check them every single day.""

### Fire Kills' top tips to stay safe from fire this Christmas

  1. Ensure you have a working smoke alarm installed on all levels of your home. Test your smoke alarms weekly and never remove batteries to power presents!
  2. Never leave cooking unattended and avoid cooking whilst drunk. The majority of fires start in the kitchen so this is a high risk area. Always turn off kitchen appliances when you have finished cooking.
  3. Never leave candles unattended. Keep decorations, cards and wrapping paper away from candles, fires, lights and heaters.
  4. Ensure you switch off fairy lights and unplug them before you go to bed, or leave the house. Check your Christmas tree lights conform to the British Standard (BS EN 60598).
  5. Always use an RCD (residual current device) on outdoor electrical equipment (This safety device can save lives by instantly switching off the power if there is a fault and can be found in any DIY store).
  6. Don't overload sockets - ensure only one plug per socket. Always turn off plugs when they are not in use, except those that are designed to be left on, like freezers.
  7. Make sure cigarettes are extinguished properly and never smoke in bed. Put it out, right out.
  8. Check on older relatives and neighbours this Christmas to ensure their safety at this time of year.
  9. Ask the experts - Many fire and rescue services in England offer free home fire risk checks to identify potential fire risks and advise what to do to reduce or prevent them. This may even include the free installation of a smoke alarm - the ideal gift for keeping your family safe.
  10. And finally, in the event of fire: get out, stay out and call 999.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1608336,"It's time for recycling rewards, not bin taxes","The new Government will scrap the last Government's plans for the imposition of bin taxes on family homes, Cabinet Ministers Eric Pickles and Caroline Spelman have announced.

The announcement was made on a visit to the country's first ever council-wide recycling reward scheme in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead today.

Ministers praised the scheme, which started off as a pilot and is now being rolled out across the council, as the right way to encourage households to recycle waste. This is in stark contrast to bin taxes that would hit people in the pocket and egg on many to find ways to avoid paying through fly-tipping or bonfires in people's back gardens.

In Windsor and Maidenhead, the ground-breaking loyalty card style scheme will reward 60,000 households who volunteer to participate with points worth up to £135 a year, at no cost to other residents, from over 100 reward partners. While a matter for local discretion, the new Government will be encouraging councils which want to get involved in such reward programmes.

In addition the scheme would save money by transferring recyclables away from expensive landfill by increasing recycling volumes and supporting the local businesses involved in the reward scheme. Windsor and Maidenhead council have involved 78 per cent of local outlets and expect a 35 per cent increase in recycling.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Rather than helping the environment, bin taxes would have fuelled fly-tipping and backyard burning. The best way to encourage people to recycle is not to punish families, but to encourage and reward them for going green. It's time to rein in the bin bullies and work with local people to build greener and cleaner communities.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said:

> ""Windsor and Maidenhead Council have got it right by rewarding people for voluntarily doing the right thing not penalising them for doing the wrong thing - that is how we can change behaviour, improve the environment and get people to play their part in a Big Society.
> 
> ""That is why we are here today supporting the first ever council-run scheme in the UK to give residents reward points or cash vouchers for recycling.""

Households volunteer to activate a RecycleBank account. They then receive a new, blue wheelie recycling bin for their mixed waste. Residents will earn points for how much residents recycle, similar to airline miles for flying - rewarding households 5.5 points for each kilogram (kg) the household recycles.

Points can be redeemed for rewards like money off products and services from participating local and national reward partners including retailers and service providers, or donated to local schools. RecycleBank already has 116 UK reward partners, including Marks and Spencer, Coffee Republic and Cineworld.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2009528,"It's time to test: change your clock, test your smoke alarm","A new hard-hitting advertising campaign is urging people to make a potentially life-saving move when they change their clocks on the weekend of 29/30 October - by taking a moment to test their smoke alarm too.

The twice-yearly clock change is a task that everybody takes for granted. Turning the clocks back for an extra hour in bed will already be on the 'to-do' list for the majority of British households over the clock change weekend.

While timekeeping is a vital part of our lives and we all keep our clocks working to stay on track, it's shocking to know that many people forget to ensure the safety of themselves and their loved ones by keeping their smoke alarm in the same working order.

A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. But only half of all householders who own a smoke alarm say that they test it's working on a regular basis.

You're more than four times as likely to die in a fire if your smoke alarm is not working. So it's clear that the simple act of testing your alarm is a vital part of any household routine.

In 2010-11, there were over 36,000 accidental fires in the home, resulting in 246 fatalities and more than 7,000 casualties. The Fire Kills Campaign hopes that by adding this simple smoke alarm check to people's clock-change routine, many more lives will be saved.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Everyone soon notices when a clock stops ticking, but it's more difficult to be sure that your smoke alarm is still in working order. The only way to make sure is through regular testing.
> 
> ""When the campaign began in 1988 only 9 per cent of homes had a smoke alarm - now that figure is 86 per cent. But having a smoke alarm is not enough - it must be kept in working order to save your life.
> 
> ""The number of fire deaths in homes has halved since 1988 but if everyone takes time to test their alarm regularly we can make sure they don't go up again.
> 
> ""We're all looking forward to getting that extra hour's sleep as British Summer Time comes to an end. Knowing that your smoke alarm is in working order will help you sleep that little bit better.""

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""You're more than four times as likely to die in a fire without a working smoke alarm. But despite the fact that nearly 250 people died in house fires last year, only half of the people who own an alarm say they take the time to check that it's working.
> 
> ""A smoke alarm can give you the vital time you need to get out, stay out and call 999 in a house fire. As you put your clocks back on 29 or 30 October take an extra moment to push the button on your alarm to make sure it is working properly - it could save your life.""

An online video has also been released showing a mantelpiece clock melting in the heat of a house fire - bringing home the harsh reality of the consequences of a fire in the home. See it at [http://bit.ly/firekillsclock](http://youtu.be/3aw1JmjIA-I) (external link).

Help keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the home by following these simple steps:

  * A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. Make sure you fit one on every level of your home and test them regularly.

  * Make testing your smoke alarm part of your household routine. Check the alarm by pressing the button regularly; change your battery once a year or invest in a 10-year alarm; and clean the alarm casing twice a year to ensure dust doesn't block the sensor.

  * Whatever happens, never remove the battery in your smoke alarm.

  * Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do in a fire and practise your escape route.

  * For more information visit the Fire Kills campaign's Facebook page at [facebook.com/firekills](https://www.facebook.com/firekills) (external link).

If you want an extra nudge to test your smoke alarm regularly, try setting an automatic reminder. Safelincs, in partnership with the Fire Kills, has created a free service that reminds you, by email or text, when it's time to test your smoke alarm, change the battery or renew the unit. The service is completely free and can be cancelled at any time ([www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders](http://www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders/)) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2016311,Julian Ashby appointed HCA Regulation Committee Chair,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today confirmed that Julian Ashby, deputy chairman of the Tenant Services Authority, has been appointed Chairman-designate to the Regulation Committee of the Homes and Communities Agency.

The committee will take on the regulatory functions within the Homes and Communities Agency of the Tenant Services Authority once it is abolished through the Localism Bill. The final appointment is subject to pre-appointment scrutiny by the Department's Select Committee and Royal Assent of the Bill.

As well as being deputy chairman of the Tenant Services Authority, Julian is also Chairman of the Institute for Voluntary Action Research and of two 'not for profit' organisations that have raised funds for social housing organisations. He is also Chair of the Financial Information Company that publishes a specialist housing journal.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""As we look to reduce red tape and regulate social housing more effectively, Julian's experience at the Tenant Services Authority will prove valuable. I look forward to working with him as he uses his skills to protect tenants' rights, and bring in the flexibilities needed to ensure that the precious resource of social housing is used most effectively to help those in greatest need.""

Anthony Mayer, Chair of the Tenant Services Authority said:

> ""Julian has played an important role for the Tenant Services Authority in improving the quality of regulation and building its credibility across the Housing Association sector. He will bring a balanced, carefully reasoned and evidence based approach to his new role that recognises the need to let providers get on with the job whilst identifying and tackling failure.""

Robert Napier, Chairman of the Homes and Communities Agency, said:

> ""The Regulatory Committee needs an experienced and skilled Chair - and Julian will bring these attributes to the HCA. This independent committee will have a vital role regulating Registered Providers of social housing, ensuring that they are well-managed and financially sound.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) is the single, national housing and regeneration delivery agency for England. Their vision is to create opportunity for people to live in homes they can afford in places they want to live, by enabling local authorities and communities to deliver the ambition they have for their own areas.

2. Subject to passage of the Localism Bill, the Tenant Services Authority (TSA) will be abolished and its economic regulation and backstop consumer regulation functions transferred to the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), generating efficiency savings in back-office functions and exploiting synergies across investment and regulation.

3. In order to ensure the continued independence of regulation, these functions will be vested in a statutory committee within the HCA, legally separated from HCA's investment functions and with its membership appointed by the Secretary of State. The Chair, who joins the HCA Board, is the first appointment to the committee and a further open competition for the remaining members will start shortly.

4. The role of consumer regulation will be refocused on setting clear service standards for social landlords and addressing serious failures against those standards, with a higher legal threshold for regulatory intervention.

5. Greater onus will be placed on local mechanisms to address routine problems and to enable tenants to hold their landlord to account and press for better services. There should be a clearer role in the complaints process for locally elected representatives and tenant panels in advocating for tenants.

6. In order to maintain lender confidence and protect taxpayers, proactive economic regulation of housing associations should continue as now but with more focus on value for money for the taxpayer.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1637560,Keeping faith in the Big Society,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said that faith groups are making a vital contribution to national life, and are integral to creating the Big Society.

Speaking to a large audience at the annual meeting of the Inter Faith Network for the UK, he told delegates that inter faith activity and faith groups were inspiring people to contribute to public service and providing support to those in need.

Mr Stunell, said:

> ""Faith communities make a vital contribution to national life, guiding the moral outlook of many, inspiring great numbers of people to public service, providing succour to those in need. They are helping to bind together local communities and improve relations at a time when the siren call of extremism has never been louder.
> 
> ""Inter faith activity is more important than ever in our work towards the Big Society, so I want to push for more inter faith dialogue and action rather than individual faith groups delivering social projects.""

### For the greater good

He added:

> ""People of faith are at the heart of civic society in local communities, and have been for decades.
> 
> ""Of course there are many different approaches, but there is a shared goal: building understanding between people from different backgrounds - not just sitting round tables but working together for the common good and tackling shared problems - be it picking up litter or challenging the far right.
> 
> ""It is not about compromising our individual beliefs - indeed we often come to understand and appreciate our own faith more when we are called upon to explain it to one another. But it is about respect for the other, the recognition of shared values and shared needs, and the will to action.
> 
> ""Interfaith groups are part of what we want to see: people reaching out to each other across boundaries of religion to make life better for all.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1824369,Kent flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Kent has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Allan Willett CMG, Lord-Lieutenant of Kent

> ""The people of Kent are immensely proud of our Frontline County. It was the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, founded in the 5th Century, with its influence spreading far beyond its present boundaries; the first to be converted to Christianity; the Guardian of England seeing off would-be invaders down the centuries; the most progressive, receiving, developing and passing on new agricultural and industrial ideas and processes; and is still, today, the Garden of England.
> 
> ""Partly because of its peninsula location Kent has a particularly strong sense of community identity. This is reflected in a continuous programme of joint working between the County's local authorities, the Lieutenancy of Kent and the Shrievalty""

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

Lady Hanham visited the Borough Council's customer service centre to officially open the new addition to the 'one stop' shop - the National Health Service (NHS), blood testing unit. Within the Centre, Kettering residents have easy access to 18 services, provided by the Council and other public bodies. These services include council bill payment, housing advice, as well as advice on jobs and legal matters, all conveniently housed under one roof.

The 'one stop' shop concept, is a creative way to improve services to residents, whilst making the best use of shared buildings.

Baroness Hanham, Local Government Minister said:

> ""The inclusion of the blood testing service within the Centre, is a vital contribution to the concept of shared services. This is a facility which I am certain will be well used, and prevent patients from having to go to hospital, for this small, but essential procedure.
> 
> ""It was evident from my visit that the inclusive nature of the services within the building was being well supported and of relevance to the many people receiving help.
> 
> ""Kettering customer services 'one stop' shop, is a good example of what can be achieved, when councils and other public bodies look at creative ways of managing their assets. By bringing together services, so that residents who need to make use of them can do so in one place, makes these services more effective. Kettering is to be commended for its forward thinking in developing this centre.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1771144,Kettering growth incentives benefit community,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps paid a visit to Kettering to see for himself how the new Homes Bonus Scheme will help a growing community, and how the incentives from the scheme could be used to benefit the town.

Under plans for the New Homes Bonus, which are now open to consultation, the Government will match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years.  Communities will work together to decide how to spend the extra funding - whether council tax discounts for local residents, boosting frontline services like rubbish collection or providing new local facilities.

Kettering has bucked the trend of the recent downturn, experiencing growth and redevelopment at a time when the construction industry faced a tough test. And local people have proved very supportive of the new building work taking place.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""House building has slumped to the lowest level since 1924 in any peace time year. Under the old system it was top down, Ministers like me ordering what happened in places like Kettering and elsewhere around the country. It's just not working. What we want is a system that actually works. The New Homes Bonus is designed to give local people something in return when they say yes to developments in their areas.""

Getting the community involved has been a key strategy for Kettering Borough Council. Whilst preparing the local development plans for the town, councillors undertook a comprehensive consultation with the community, opening a shop to discuss the challenges and opportunities of new development in the town. As a result of those discussions, it was clear that local people wanted more local restaurants in their town centre, and a Market Place Restaurant project was brought forward.

With this wealth of experience already under their belts, councillors are now excited by the opportunities that the New Homes Bonus could bring to the area.

As Cllr Mark Dearing, portfolio holder for economic development and regeneration, said:

> ""The New Homes Bonus will provide a huge incentive for Kettering Borough Council in helping to bring to life the aspirations of our residents.""

Mr Shapps also announced a new £30 million fund for self builders, which will provide short-term finance to help unlock projects where groups of self-build homes are built at the same time.

### Self-build industry is 'riding the crest of a wave'

With the number of mortgages available to self-builders set to rise by 141 per cent, and over 100,000 people looking for self-build plots across the country, Mr Shapps said the self-build industry was ""riding the crest of a wave"".

Yet despite this interest, Britain still lags behind the rest of the world, with just one in ten of all homes each year built by self-builders - so the Government has pledged to double the size of the industry.

### £30 million to go Dutch

To mark the start of his new role, Mr McCloud today accompanied the Housing Minister as he leads a UK trade delegation to the Netherlands, to see what lessons can be learnt from the highly successful Dutch self-build industry.

They visited Almere near Amsterdam, the largest low-cost self-build experiment in Europe, which has grown rapidly in recent years. The Minister travelled with a delegation from the UK housing industry, and hosted an event with Dutch Ministers and business leaders at the British Embassy to boost trade and links between Dutch and British businesses.

Mr Shapps also announced that he will shortly be launching a new £30 million fund to provide short-term finance for projects similar to those at Almere, where groups of self-build homes are built at the same time.

These types of projects have been held back in the UK because of reluctance by lenders to provide finance. Self-build groups will now be able to bid for a slice of the cash to part fund land acquisition and early development costs with money being repaid on completion of the project.

### Encouraging lenders to lend

Mr Shapps is also writing to key players in the mortgage market, highlighting the strong business case for lending to self-builders and helping to turn their housebuilding dreams into reality.

Citing recent surveys by the Building Societies Association Grant Shapps said that 53 per cent of those asked would be interested in building their own home - while almost two thirds of those said they would like to begin building within the next two years.

In his letters to lenders, Mr Shapps also highlighted a new 'toolkit' prepared by the Building Societies Association, which will provide information and advice to lenders looking to expand into this growing self-build market.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The self-build industry is riding the crest of a wave, with more people than ever wanting control over the design and build of their home. But despite this self-build surge, we continue to lag behind the rest of the world. I am determined to change this so anyone who wants to embark on a self-build project has the opportunity to do so.
> 
> ""That's why I am delighted Kevin McCloud has agreed to represent the industry - championing the cause of existing and aspiring self-builders across the country, and raising the issues and concerns that matter most to them.
> 
> ""Together we will travel with a UK trade delegation to the Netherlands to learn from the leaders in low-cost self-build, and to boost trade links between British and Dutch businesses. Self-build is good news for the economy - so I'm writing to lenders and encouraging them to use their own industry's toolkit to see how they can lend to those who want to build their own homes and expand into this growing market.""

Kevin McCloud said:

> ""In the past we have built some of the poorest performing, most expensive and smallest homes in Europe. That's not something to celebrate.
> 
> ""But there is another way. What if we became a nation of self builders like the Dutch? What if each household in the UK had the option to build their own place? What if large-scale developers provided finished-slab, fully-serviced sites for homebuilders?
> 
> ""We'd see more customised homes that reflect where they are, to higher space standards and to a better quality. We'd see people sharing skills and saving money. We'd see neighbours working together on community self build schemes and local construction economies thriving. And we'd certainly see more energy efficient buildings and a wider embracing of green technologies.
> 
> ""Self build is seen as a long, difficult and self- sacrificing process. But with the right planning, help and support it can be enjoyable and - on collective schemes - empowering.""

Chairman of the National Self Build Association Ted Stevens said:

> ""Kevin is a fantastic ambassador for the self build sector, and we're delighted he has agreed to become our champion. He has a real enthusiasm to see new types of self build happen in the UK - and I know he shares our interest in the innovative developments that are taking place in Continental Europe - particularly in the Netherlands and Germany. There are many lessons to be learnt from here that could have a huge impact if we applied some of them in the UK.
> 
> ""We're also delighted that he's agreed to record a short welcome video for the new self build portal that the industry has just launched. This should be up and running in the next few days. The portal explains - in a very independent way - all the different ways of undertaking a self build project and helps would-be self builders figure out the best way of tackling a project for the money they have available.""

### Champion picked by industry

Appointed by the National Self-Build Association on behalf of industry, Kevin McCloud will be a champion for all self-builders, particularly by:

  * raising public awareness of the benefits of self/custom building a home; and
  * helping the self-build industry promote the services available to those looking to build for the first time.

Mr McCloud has also backed a new industry-sponsored self build website ([www.selfbuildportal.org.uk](http://www.selfbuildportal.org.uk/) external link) offering help and advice for aspiring self-builders, meaning that anyone looking to build their own property has a one-stop shop for all the support they may need.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended earlier this year by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant. Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order, or in the case of Lancashire - to coincide with the county day on 27 November.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors.  This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Chris Dawson from the Friends of Real Lancashire said:

> ""Successive governments have confirmed the boundaries of Lancashire, and we welcome their further confirmation by the new government, which demonstrates the valuable part that traditional counties play in modern life.
> 
> ""We hope that the flying of traditional county flags outside the Department's office will lead to further measures to promote the identity of Britain's traditional counties. We welcome the flying of the Lancashire flag in celebration of Lancashire Day.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1933449,Latest councils at forefront of bringing growth-led benefits named,"Pioneering councils eager to demonstrate how they would ensure the benefits of development would be shared with their community were today named by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

The group of 20 Local Authorities are the second to join the Community Infrastructure Levy Front Runners project. This was set up to support Local Authorities eager to develop effective ways of implementing the reformed levy in their local areas.

The levy gives councils more choice and flexibility in how they fund infrastructure that local communities need and want and has the potential to raise an estimated £1 billion a year of funding by 2016 that can be used by neighbourhoods and councils to support local growth.

Greg Clark:

> ""Yet again we've seen a lot of enthusiasm from councils eager to introduce the reformed Community Infrastructure Levy, to ensure the many benefits development can bring are not lost to local communities.
> 
> ""This second wave of Front Runners will ensure local neighbourhoods reap the rewards from growth in their areas and provide valuable lessons others can learn from in the future.""

Each Front Runner will have access to a tailored package of support from the Planning Advisory Service to help them set a charge for their area. This will include group workshops and good practice advice.

Helen Howie, principal planning officer at Shropshire Council, one of the first Front Runner councils introducing the levy said:

> ""The Front Runners Programme has already proved its worth from my perspective. It has been really useful for developing our Charging Schedule. The project's helped us develop the right approach for Shropshire, which complies with the regulations and helps delivers our local ambitions.""

The 20 councils selected for phase two of the Front Runners project are:

  * London Borough of Barnet

  * Barnsley Metropolitan Council

  * Bristol City Council

  * Cambridgeshire Horizons (East Cambs District Council and Huntingdonshire District Council)

  * Chelmsford Borough Council

  * London Borough of Croydon

  * Elmbridge Borough Council

  * Gedling Borough Council

  * Havant Borough Council

  * London Borough of Islington

  * Milton Keynes Council

  * Oxford City Council

  * Plymouth City Council

  * Redcar and Cleveland Council

  * St Helens Council

  * London Borough of Sutton

  * Swindon Borough Council

  * Torbay Council

  * London Borough of Wandsworth

  * Wycombe District Council

The Front Runners project ensures all Local Authorities can access useful examples of good practice.

### Notes to editors

1. On 18 November 2010 Greg Clark announced the Government's plans to reform the Community Infrastructure Levy. The Community Infrastructure Levy was first introduced by the previous Government in April 2010. It allows local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from developers undertaking new building projects in their area. The money can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development.

2. A revised version of the Department's Community Infrastructure Levy overview document is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/communityinfrastructurelevymay11](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/communityinfrastructurelevymay11).

3. The Planning Advisory Service provides consultancy and peer support, learning events and online resources to help local authorities understand and respond to planning reform.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1624036,Less red tape and more accountability,"Councils will be freed from wasting millions of public pounds and thousands of man hours reporting back to Government, with the start of a new era of transparency and public accountability, enabling councils to focus more on frontline services.

Secretary of State Eric Pickles has written to council leaders to tell them that he has instructed the Audit Commission and five other local inspectorates to stop costly top-down reports officially known as the Comprehensive Area Assessments (CAA).

Ministers believe that ending CAA will save the Audit Commission £10 million, and councils will also feel the financial benefit, as independent research put the average annual cost of reporting back to government at £1.8m. In 2006 the National Audit Office estimated the overall cost of monitoring local government at £2 billion a year.

Ministers and Council leaders discuss the end of CAA

### Transparency and public accountability, not Whitehall red-tape

Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""In the face of the nation's £156bn deficit, Central Government needs to stop the costly top-down monitoring that is engulfing councils and start trusting them to do what is right locally.
> 
> ""Today I have instructed Town Hall watchdogs to stop tying the hands of council workers with unnecessary red tape and paperwork.
> 
> ""It is much more important for the public to know what their councils are doing than having thousands of hush-hush, unseen papers being sent back and forth between Whitehall bureaucrats and the Town Hall.
> 
> ""We are already pushing power as far away from Whitehall as we can and calling on councils to throw open their books to create much more cost effective and efficient local public services.""

Mr Pickles has called for greater transparency and openness to be the default setting for how councils do their business, publishing all information on the quality of council services online. This will root out wild overspending, expensive mistakes and unnecessary waste saving the public millions.

### Facts and figures:

Leicestershire councils found they had 90 full time staff collecting and processing more than 3,000 individual data items for central government at a cost of £3.7m a year. They also faced 83 different inspections every year.

The Government has ended top down targets and is committed to giving power over housing and other development back to people, communities and councils. This includes abolishing regional strategies with their centrally imposed housing targets.

The changes put local authorities in the driving seat when it comes to delivering the right growth for their area and the work that Lincolnshire County Council will lead will provide a range of support and advice that councils can draw on in developing plans and applying the very best practice when it comes to delivering sustainable development.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""We have moved away from the Whitehall knows best approach where central government dictated to councils what and where to build. Local councils are now free to take the decisions that are right for their communities and Lincolnshire County Council will establish a range of support, advice and links to key organisations that will help councils in getting on and deliver sustainable growth.""

The council will take over the running and management of the growth points website that will provide a range of advice and guidance based on local authorities sharing experience on how they can successfully tackle environment and infrastructure issues affecting housing growth such as flooding, water supply, nature conservation impacts and transport. They will establish an advisory group bringing together local authorities, publicising case studies, linking with the private sector and universities as well as relevant departments and agencies.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is making £44,000 funding available over the next two years to support Lincolnshire in delivering this key piece of work.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2084634,Liverpool first to strike new City Deal with government,"Liverpool has become the first city to agree new powers through the City Deals programme, the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg and Cities Minister Greg Clark announced today.

A range of transformative powers will be devolved to Liverpool to give the city what it needs to attract private investment, close skills gaps and create new jobs.

This landmark deal will create a new enterprise zone near the city centre, provide powers to help get young unemployed people into work and give greater control over land for redevelopment and help build twelve new secondary schools.

The deal will help the city compete in the wider economy, driving growth and creating opportunities that will benefit the wider Merseyside area.

City Deals are being negotiated with a number of England's cities. Instead of being presented with a set menu of measures decided in Whitehall, each city is now able to specify the particular powers they need to meet local needs and priorities.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg said:

> ""This first city deal heralds an unprecedented transfer of power from central government to local communities, with new powers and funding for Liverpool to do things its own way. I congratulate Liverpool on blazing a trail we look forward to seeing others follow.
> 
> ""I firmly believe one size doesn't fit all - whether it's a Mayor or whether it is a Council Leader, what Cities have to show in return for a City Deal is that there is strong clear leadership. This deal puts Liverpool back in the driving seat to create jobs and boost skills with greater economic and political freedom. It empowers Liverpool to go for growth that will benefit everyone who lives there.
> 
> ""Our cities are Britain's economic heartbeat and their success is absolutely vital to getting the whole country's economy growing again. I want to see more cities take us up on our offer and I'm looking forward to announcing more city deals across the country in the coming months.""

Cities Minister, Greg Clark said:

> ""We've said to each City 'make us an offer'. Tell us how you can drive growth, and I promise that the Government will respond positively.
> 
> ""Liverpool has risen to the challenge with alacrity.
> 
> ""It is fantastic to see Liverpool become the first city in Britain to seize the opportunity on offer. This deal will be a major boost to the standing of this great city - both within Britain and on the world stage. Liverpool has seized the chance to attract private investment, create jobs and build a prosperous future.
> 
> ""This is, I hope, the first of many such deals with our cities. For Britain to prosper our cities must prosper. I am determined to devolve power from Whitehall and give local leaders what they need to take their cities forward into a confident and prosperous future.""

The key elements of Liverpool's proposals are:

  * A new Enterprise Zone, that will create a 'City Fringe Buffer Zone' to the north of the city centre and Central Business District. This means that for the next 25 years increases in Business Rate income, would be invested in regeneration. The Government will also be prepared to support economic development backed by a strong business case by up to £75 million during the spending review period.
  * Creation of a joint Mayoral Investment Board to oversee the city's economic and housing strategy, pooling local assets including those of the Homes and Communities Agency to drive economic growth.
  * Launch Welfare Pilots to reduce welfare dependency. The city will work closely with the Government on local schemes including a 'youth contract' to increase the number of claimants moving to work and to reduce fraud and error.
  * A Secondary School Investment Plan to build 12 new secondary schools including at least six new academies to help support the local skills agenda and the local economy. The Council will work with the schools, private companies and local universities to develop specialisms to meet local skills shortages.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1708546,Local enterprise partnerships to spring up across the country,"The Government has confirmed that it has received 56 local enterprise partnership proposals from councils and businesses across the country.

> Gone are the artificial political regions of RDAs.

Local enterprise partnerships can rewrite the economic geography of the country - unconstrained by arbitrary boundaries of Regional Development Agencies and the top-down prescription approach taken previously.

Proposals include partnerships that cut across existing regional boundaries and include universities or community groups among them.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""These 56 local enterprise partnership proposals are just the beginning of a new radical way of delivering prosperity and rebalancing the economy.
> 
> ""We are facing economic problems that need solutions from local communities. The secret to the success of local enterprise partnerships will be working on the basis of local economic geography. Gone are the artificial political regions of RDAs; this will better serve the needs of local business.
> 
> ""The bureaucracy of Regional Development Agencies gave local authorities little reason to engage creatively with economic issues. Local enterprise partnerships are a way of tying council and business interests together, and creating the conditions for business to thrive and prosper.""

### Fast feedback to maintain momentum

Over the coming weeks Ministers will consider the proposals in detail, looking at how they will support economic growth, before providing feedback to partnerships ahead of the publication of the White Paper on sub-national economic growth and the introduction of the Localism Bill.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark added:

> ""The process of establishing Local Enterprise Partnerships has been led from the bottom up, giving the initiative to local areas to create partnerships which make sense to them, rather than being dictated from Whitehall. I am delighted that Local Authorities and businesses across the country have responded with such creativity.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1989328,Local enterprise partnerships: Eric Pickles and Greg Clark attend inaugural growth summit,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark are urging Local Enterprise Partnerships to push for local growth and to challenge Whitehall for the powers and freedoms they need at an inaugural summit in London.

Mr Pickles will tell the summit, hosted by the Local Enterprise Partnership Network, that partnerships have got off to a strong start setting goals and ambitions. The next year will be about turning ambition into results.

The Secretary of State will highlight examples of creativity and innovation around the country including: York and North Yorkshire developing an accreditation for young entrepreneurs; Coventry and Warwickshire working with banks to help small firms access finance; and Cumbria working to spread high-speed broadband to rural areas. Local leadership would continue to decide how far these partnerships could drive growth and jobs.

There are now 37 Local Enterprise Partnerships, covering 98 per cent of the country, representing 98 per cent of all businesses and 23 million employees in England. Ministers announced last year that local business and civic leaders would take the reins of their local economies and drive local growth and jobs.

Opening today's event, Mr Clark urged partnerships to tell Ministers what more they needed from Whitehall to help their local economies thrive, whether it was more control over housing, transport or skills, or discretion to pool budgets across local authority boundaries.

Partnerships from across the country are attending the London event; from Cornwall, to Leeds, to Tees Valley. Local Enterprise Partnerships discussed challenges and ambitions for the future in panel sessions and raised issues with attending Government Ministers, which also included the Transport and Business Secretaries.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will say:

> ""This Government came to power with a different view of how you create the conditions for economic growth. We believe in local power, matched with local responsibility.
> 
> ""It's an unprecedented opportunity for local leaders to take choices and make decisions. This is one of those points in history where individuals really do have a chance to make their mark. The next year has to be about turning ambition into results.
> 
> ""Government is ready to listen. There is no limit to what partnerships might want to propose but their own imagination and ambition, nothing is off the table.""

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Local Enterprise Partnerships are putting councils and entrepreneurs in charge of laying the foundations for local prosperity. Working together, each brings their particular expertise, their local knowledge and business acumen, to bear. The potential rewards are vast - new jobs, fresh investment, and a higher quality of life for local people.
> 
> ""I know that there is a great appetite among partnerships to look and see what others are doing, to adapt their innovations, borrow their brainwaves - the better to build on their early achievements.
> 
> ""Too often, in the past, the dice were loaded against local communities. The success of decentralisation relies on local leaders working out what kinds of discretion and flexibility would help them, and pulling those powers down from Whitehall.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1714292,Local experts to map true scale of rough sleeping,"Councils and local homelessness charities will use their local knowledge to more accurately assess the number of rough sleepers in their area, after the Housing Minister Grant Shapps today overhauled the way rough sleeping is monitored across the country.

Previously, only councils in presumed hotspot areas were required to conduct official rough sleeper counts - meaning that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. So under this method, figures published in July showed that on any given night there were just 440 rough sleepers in England.

However, for the first time areas which did not physically count were asked to provide estimates this spring and when the figures from these 256 councils were included a further estimated 807 rough sleepers were found - taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night. Considerably higher than the 440 previously thought.

So, after consultation with homelessness charities and council, all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. The aim of this is to get a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.

Where a council decides not to conduct an official count they will submit a robust estimate of the number of people rough sleeping on their streets on a typical night - consulting with and gathering information from homelessness charities and agencies working in their area.

But where there is a more significant problem this will be done by street counts with representatives of Homeless Link, the national charity for all homelessness agencies, attending counts rather than Government officials as under the old system. This will help ensure those working directly to help people off the streets can best offer their expertise and advice.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For too long a supposedly national figure of rough sleepers hasn't reflected the reality on our streets. Councils and local charities know their areas best. That's why I am putting them centre stage in assessing the true scale of the problem they face locally. By having accurate numbers and a better national picture of the problem - we can start to help the homeless much more effectively.
> 
> ""But this isn't just about crunching numbers - I want this problem to be treated with the seriousness it deserves. That is why I've brought Ministers from across eight Government departments together so that the needs of the homeless across the whole country are being met not just in terms of housing, but in also employment, training, rehabilitation and healthcare.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/issuesandresponses/newsroom/localgovernmentfunding,Local government funding,"A spokesperson from the Department for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""The Government has provided a fair and progressive funding settlement for councils that protect front-line services and shield the most vulnerable.
> 
> Councils have challenging decisions to make around how they prioritise spending but the Government is clear that councils must resist any temptation to pass on disproportionate savings to the voluntary sector.
> 
> ""In their approach to budget setting, the best councils are showing that they understand that a strong, thriving voluntary sector is more important now than ever and could be the key to providing high quality, good value services to their residents. But this is not the case everywhere. Councils that are failing to recognise the importance of the sector are being short sighted in their approach.""

### Background

Councils will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and the grant has been adjusted so none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall.

Many councils are actively working to protect voluntary organisations. Reading has boosted funding to voluntary organisations by more than £220,000 this year to over £7 million.

Hackney has given £2.5m extra funding to the VCS. Thurrock and Wolverhampton have announced that they will protect all VCS funding until 2012.

The Government has created a Transition Fund (£100m from the Office for Civil Society), to support voluntary groups next year.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2131292,Local government ombudsman to champion residents' cause,"A Chairman and Vice Chairman Ombudsman who will lead a more customer-focused Commission that champions the rights of redress for local residents were appointed today.

Acting Chairman Dr Jane Martin has been designated as Chairman of the Commission for Local Administration in England and Anne Seex as Vice-Chairman. Both are already performing Local Government Ombudsman roles.

Creating a more streamlined Local Government Ombudsman will deliver a more cost effective organisation and make sure that the Ombudsman is well placed to provide services that support citizens' needs with a particular emphasis on consumer champions as envisaged in the Open Public Services White Paper.

The Minister for Local Government Grant Shapps said:

> ""I am delighted that Jane Martin and Ann Seex have taken up the task of leading the Local Government Ombudsman. I know they are determined to champion the rights of local residents.
> 
> ""The Local Government Ombudsman has a vital role to play in the community making sure people get swift and fair redress if things go wrong in the delivery of their local services.""

### Notes to editors

1. Dr Jane Martin was appointed to the post of Local Government Ombudsman and Vice-chair of the Commission for Local Administration in England in January 2010.  Since November 2010 she has been Acting Chair following the retirement of Sir Tony Redmond. She has extensive knowledge and experience of public service delivery. At the University of Birmingham and Warwick Business School she conducted research on public management and governance in the fields of education, health and local government. She has worked in local authorities across England as a consultant for the Improvement and Development Agency for Local Government (IDeA) and was the first Executive Director of the Centre for Public Scrutiny. Prior to joining Local Government Ombudsman she was Deputy Chief Executive at the Local Better Regulation Office and a Non-executive Director of Coventry Primary Care Trust.

2. Anne Seex was appointed to the Commission as the Local Government Ombudsman based at York in October 2005. She previously had over 25 years' experience in local government, joining the Commission from Norwich City Council where she had served as Chief Executive for five years. Anne's experience included 11 years in various roles in the Chief Executive's Department at Manchester City Council. She left Manchester to become Director of Community Services for Lancaster City Council where she was responsible for housing, leisure, environmental health, engineering and estates.

3. The Commission for Local Administration in England, (better known as the Local Government Ombudsman) is charged by Parliament with investigating complaints from individual citizens that have suffered injustice arising from maladministration by local authorities. The authorities that the Ombudsman has jurisdiction over are primarily local authorities, as well as education admissions appeal panels, fire and police authorities, the Greater London Authority and more recently schools and private adult care homes. The service is free at point of use.

The Ombudsman can recommend redress and remedial action where they determine there has been an injustice. In 2010-2011 the Commission investigated and decided over 10,792 complaints.

4. The Government has also given the commission permission to appoint a Chief Operating Officer who will take over the functions of Chief Executive and Accounting Officer as part of a more streamlined senior management. The creation of the Chief Operating Officer role does not result in an overall increase in the Commission's headcount.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2032134,Local pay accountability guidance published today,"Local authority pay policies must be open to public scrutiny with senior pay packets put to a full council vote, Local Government Minister Bob Neill said today (17 November 2011).

The Localism Act requires local authority pay policies to be openly approved by democratically elected councillors. The Act was formally enshrined in law this week when granted Royal Assent.

The associated guidance published today on 'Openness and accountability in Local Pay' sets out the requirement for councils to publish their remuneration arrangements, including for chief officers and approve large salary packages in an open session of full council.

Ministers explicitly say in the guidance that the pay vote ceiling should be set at £100,000. This includes publicly justifying any big bonuses, and above inflation annual pay rises, or hiring a person already in receipt of retirement or severance money. Authorities should have an explicit policy in their pay statement on whether or not they permit such practices.

At a time when the public are tightening their belts and all parts of the public sector are looking to make savings Ministers think taxpayers should have the opportunity to see whether value for money has been considered when setting pay policies.

The guidance states: ""Taxpayers should rightly expect that their interests are being protected including when senior staff move posts within the public sector, particularly when those moves could be seen to have the effect of driving up average pay levels across the sector.""

The measures will come into force in two months' time and pay policy statements must be in place by 31 March 2012. Ministers are calling on councils to schedule their Full Council meeting as soon as possible so pay policy is ready in time for the law change.

Bob Neill said:

> ""The Localism Act opens up council pay rules so that salaries for senior posts get 'democracy proofed'. Local authorities will now publicly vote on these practices at full council.
> 
> ""Taxpayers have the right to expect that their interests are being protected including when senior staff move from post to post. Any responsible locally elected councillor will want to use their pay vote to secure value for money.""

  
The Localism Act is one of the most radical pieces of legislation to be voted through Parliament - it fundamentally shifts the balance of power to communities and reinforces the importance of strong local democratic rights.

The pay bill for top managers in local government was estimated at £626.9 million in 2008 by the Local Government Association group, the Local Government Employers.

Last year the Secretary of State Eric Pickles called for council chief executives earning over £200,000 to take a ten per cent pay cut and those earning £150,000 - which is more than the Prime Minister's current salary of £142,000 - to take a five per cent pay cut.

### Notes to editors

1. Provisions are included in the Localism Act that require local authorities and fire and rescue authorities to approve and publish annually at Full Council (for Fire and Rescue Authorities, a meeting of members), a senior pay policy statement which authorities will be required to follow when setting senior pay. Where councils want to depart from the pay policy, these would need to be referred back to Full Council (or a meeting of members for Fire and Rescue Authorities) to vote on.

2. The Localism Act also includes provision for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on the content and application of senior pay statements. Relevant authorities must have regard to this guidance in the exercise of their functions under the pay accountability provisions. The new pay guidance 'Openness and accountability in local pay: Draft guidance under section 40 of the Localism Act' can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/draftguidancelocalpay](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/draftguidancelocalpay).

3. The statement must include the authority's policies relating to:

a. the level and elements of remuneration for each chief officer  
b. remuneration of chief officers on recruitment  
c. increases and additions to remuneration for each chief officer  
d. the use of performance related pay for chief officers  
e. the use of bonuses for chief officers  
f. the approach to the payment of chief officers on their ceasing to hold office under or to be employed by the authority, and  
g. the publication of and access to information relating to remuneration of chief officers.

4. The term 'remuneration' covers:

a. the chief officer's salary or, in the case of a chief officer engaged by the authority under a contract for services, payments made by the authority to the chief officer for those services  
b. any bonuses payable by the authority to the chief officer  
c. any charges, fees or allowances payable by the authority to the chief officer  
d. any benefits in kind to which the chief officer is entitled as a result of the chief officer's office or employment  
e. any increase in or enhancement of the chief officer's pension entitlement where the increase or enhancement is as a result of a resolution of the authority, and  
f. any amounts payable by the authority to the chief officer on the chief officer ceasing to hold office under or be employed by the authority, other than amounts that may be payable by virtue of any enactment.

5. The Secretary of State published 'The Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency' on 29 September 2011. The Code enshrines the principles of transparency and asks councils to follow three principles when publishing data they hold; responding to public demand; releasing data in open formats available for re-use; and, releasing data in a timely way. This includes data on senior salaries and the structure of their workforce. The code can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode).

6. According to the Local Government Employers data from the Joint Negotiating Committee's Salaries and Numbers survey 2008 and Setting Rewards for Top Managers in Local Government, the chief officers pay bill is £576.5 million and Chief Executives is £50.4 million.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1746693,Local taxpayers to benefit from Council Tax freeze,"Millions of council taxpayers across England are in line to see their council tax bills frozen next year as a result of a deal struck in the Spending Review, Eric Pickles announced today.

Despite the tough fiscal decisions being taken in the Spending Review, ministers have been able to honour the coalition agreement to freeze council tax.

The Treasury has set aside an extra £650 million to help local authorities in England freeze their council tax next year, meaning local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £70.

Council tax has more than doubled since 1997 and Ministers believe that a freeze will offer real help to hard working families and those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners. Scotland has benefited from a council tax freeze for a number of years without adversely affecting frontline services. During the period that Scotland has had a freeze in place the average bill in England has risen, so that an equivalent Band D home now pays £290 a year more than that north of the border.

The new grant scheme will be open to all billing and major precepting authorities, including police and fire authorities, which decide to freeze or reduce their council tax next year. If they do, they will receive additional funding in 2011-12, equivalent to raising their 2010-11 council tax by 2.5 per cent. The Spending Review also commits to providing authorities with additional funding in future years to ""lock in"" the benefits of the one year freeze and help ensure council taxpayers will not face subsequent excessive increases.

The news of funding for a council tax freeze comes ahead of Government plans to legislate in the next month's Localism Bill to give local residents new powers to veto excessive council tax rises that will replace Whitehall capping from 2012-13 onwards.  Until then the Secretary of State is clear he reserves the right to use capping powers against any individual authorities which ignore the freeze and set excessive council tax increases.

Ministers have already confirmed there will not be any council tax revaluation in England, which could have resulted in some households facing hefty tax increases from moving up council tax bands. Four times as many homes moved up one or more bands than down in the 2005 council tax revaluation in Wales.

Communities and Local Government Secretary of State, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""Hard working families and pensioners have seen their council tax bills more than double since 1997. But the new Government is standing up for hard-pressed local residents, providing special funding to help councils freeze their bills next year. Further financial freedoms announced for councils will mean they can better protect frontline services like rubbish collections and care for the elderly.
> 
> ""The new Government has already stopped the council tax revaluation which would have lead to higher council tax bills over this Parliament for many families. And we will give local residents a new power to veto excessive council tax rises in the future, to protect the interests of local communities and strengthen local democracy.""

### Notes for editors

1. A table listing the potential saving for households in each billing authority in England is available to download below. Average Band D council tax in England excluding parishes is currently £1,420. Stopping a 5 per cent council tax rise (the last Government's capping threshold in recent years) would therefore save £71 in 2011-12. Should an average 2.5 per cent rise have occurred the saving would have been £35.

2. An indicative breakdown of the estimated grants, based on 2010-11 figures, that individual local authorities will receive has been published today to help councils with budget planning. Final grants will be published once the Department has received councils' own 2011-12 figures in March next year. The full table is available to download below.

3. The council tax freeze offer will apply separately to each billing and major precepting authority in England (rather than to each council tax bill issued). Billing authorities include shire districts, metropolitan districts, London Boroughs and unitary authorities and major precepting authorities include county councils, fire and rescue authorities, police authorities and the Greater London Authority. The Government is urging town and parish councils to exercise restraint and make sure no council taxpayer faces an increased bill.

4. If an authority sets its basic amount of council tax in 2011-12 at a level which is no more than its basic amount of council tax in 2010-11, it will receive a grant equivalent to a 2.5 per cent increase in its 2010-11 basic amount of council tax multiplied by the authority's tax base for 2011-12 (rounded to the nearest pound).

5. This offer will also allow a local authority to reduce council tax (an absolute reduction in cash terms) if they wish, and still receive the 2.5 per cent grant in full.

6. An un-ringfenced grant in support of the scheme will be paid to each eligible billing and major precepting authority based on the formula. Payments to authorities will be made through the grant-making powers in section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003 and by instalments over the period April 2011 to January 2012 to mirror authorities' monthly income stream from council tax receipts.

7. For the subsequent Spending Review years the Government intends to provide the same funding via 'section 31 grants' to continue to offset council tax income foregone during the period of the freeze, so avoiding any 'cliff-edge' effect.

8. In June 2010, the Government announced that it will introduce measures through the Localism Bill to scrap capping and allow local residents to veto higher council tax rises instead through local referendums. Subject to Parliamentary ratification, these provisions will apply from 2012-13. Prior to this legislation, the Government is prepared to use its capping powers to stop excessive increases this year in 2011-12 by local bodies which intend to impose big rises and disregard the offer of freezing their residents' bills.

9. In the Spending Review, the Government has also giving councils significantly more freedom to decide how to focus money on local priorities and protect frontline services and voluntary groups, by freeing up ring-fenced funding and rolling more grants into formula grant.

10. The police authorities of Greater Manchester and Nottinghamshire that are subject to capping in advance for 2011-12, will be able to take part in the scheme. Decisions on how the Government proposes to proceed in relation to these authorities will be made at the same time as the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement.

11. The Government is providing funding for police authorities who freeze their precept in 2011-12. Provision for this was included in the police settlement announced on 20 October.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1889672,Localising audit - delivering value for money for the tax payer,"The firm FTI have today been appointed to provide advice on the most cost effective options for disbanding the Audit Commission and transferring audit into the private sector.

In August last year the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced plans to disband the Audit Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold their councils and other public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

The Government is taking forward plans to transfer the audit function of the Audit Commission out of public ownership.

The changes to auditing will establish an audit market that offers greater competition and choice and it is anticipated that the reforms will save the taxpayer £50 million a year.

FTI have been appointed to provide professional, independent advice on the financial implications of the options for transferring the in-house audit practice to the private sector including the possibility of mutualisation.

FTI will bring commercial expertise to assess how best to achieve a good deal for the taxpayer that will maximise the value for money for the public purse.

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""We have set in train measures to radically scale back centrally imposed, bureaucratic and costly inspection and auditing, saving council taxpayers money.
> 
> ""Auditing provides the assurances and confidence that public money is being properly spent. But having an effective audit system is not dependant on it being part of the public sector. The audit function of the Commission will therefore be moved into the private sector. Bringing in commercial expertise to support this process is a sensible measure that will help us to secure value for money for the public purse.""

FTI's work will inform the wider decisions about how best to take forward, in the most effective way, the transfer of the in-house audit practice into the private sector.

FTI specialises in corporate finance and restructure. The consulting firm has been appointed on a four week contract following a competitive tender process. They will examine the implications associated with each of the main options for transferring the audit practice into the private sector advising on the value for money considerations and risk.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2126294,Localism Act: power shift to communities charges on,"Today the Government's revolution to hand power back to local communities reaches a major milestone as measures in the Localism Act come into force.

Local people, businesses and councils are at the heart of communities and the Government is determined to put them back in control with the choices and chances to shape the future of their local area.

The Localism Act, which received Royal assent in November 2011, is driving this power shift, wiping away unpopular bureaucratic interferences and cutting red tape that locked out communities, slowed progress and stifled innovation.

Parliamentary measures known as commencement orders have brought key measures of the Localism Act into effect, including new neighbourhood planning powers which give local people a major say in helping to shape the look and feel of their areas. Over 200 neighbourhood planning front-runner projects have trialled these new powers, now all communities across the country can get involved.

The key new measures to hand back control, include:

  * **General power of competence** is now in place for all English local authorities, including eligible parish councils. Councils can innovate and legally do anything an individual could do unless specifically prohibited by law. This should give councils that want to continue holding formal prayers the confidence and legal standing to do so. This also gives councils more freedom to work together act creatively and innovatively to improve services, drive down costs and enhance their local area. Councils have asked for this power because it will help them get on with the job.
  * **New local discounts** are available so councils can actively target their own businesses rate discounts in the best way for local businesses. This can be used to encourage new business investment, support for local shops, the high street or community services. Councils should consider this new power alongside the Government's 'Portas Pilots' plans.
  * **Community Right to Build** giving communities a new way to deliver development they want. If they want, communities will be able to build family homes to sell, affordable housing for rent, sheltered housing for older local residents, or low-cost starter homes for young local families struggling to get on the housing ladder.
  * **New planning enforcement rules** which give councils the ability to take action against people who deliberately conceal unauthorised development. They also help to tackle the abuses of retrospective planning applications which have in the past been used to spin out planning appeals.
  * **Reform of social housing regulation** giving social landlords greater freedom to meet local needs and tenant's stronger tools to hold landlords to account. Changes to the way complaints are managed will follow in 2013.

Measures to scrap interfering and costly bureaucracy and cut red tape include:

  * The heavy debt burden of the **Ports tax** has officially been lifted giving Port-based businesses facing unfair and unexpected backdated business rates bills a clean slate to get on with business. The estimated value of the waived tax bills across England totals more than £175 million.
  * **Abolition of the Standards Board for England**; the bureaucratic and ineffective regime is replaced with locally drawn up codes of conduct. This frees up time and money from councils having to investigate trivial complaints whilst councillors involved in corruption and misconduct will face appropriately serious sanctions.
  * **Abolition of the Infrastructure Planning Commission** which was not directly accountable to the public. Major planning decisions are returned to Government Ministers, democratically accountable to the public. This will not affect the timescales in which decisions are made.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Today is a major turning point in the balance of power in this country as new rights and freedoms for communities to take back control come into force.
> 
> ""The historic Localism Act is beginning to reverse more than 100 years of centralisation, returning power back to citizens, communities and local groups to manage their own affairs free from Whitehall interference.
> 
> ""These powerful reforms are the next step in breaking up the monopoly of Whitehall over public services, giving local people with good ideas the right of initiative to do things differently.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Government's historic mission to put communities back in control gathers pace today as more and more of the Localism Act comes into effect.
> 
> ""Instead of putting barriers in the way of communities we are actively taking them away, wiping out interferences, cutting red tape and giving people the power to shape the future of their local area. As this revolution in local power rolls on communities can be confident that they are truly at the heart of decision making.""

### Notes to editors

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1830951,Localism Bill impact assessments published,"Evidence underpinning the measures in the Localism Bill to aid analysis and discussion was published today (see link, right).

The Localism Bill will put an end to the centralisation of power in government allowing local communities and councils the freedom to run their lives and neighbourhoods in their own way.

The impact assessments report on the potential impact of implementing the decentralisation and localism elements of the Coalition Agreement. They will help promote the devolution of power away from Westminster and Whitehall to local councils and communities.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Any public policy has pros and cons. In one of the most comprehensive exercises undertaken by any government department to date, we are setting out our frank assessment of the effects of our radical proposals. This demonstrates our commitment to openness and transparency. These reports prove the net benefits to local economies, to local democracy and to community life of the Coalition Government's decentralisation programme.""

The set of Impact Assessments should be considered together within the context of the overall Localism Bill. They cover the following:

  * the abolition of the Standards Board Regime, clarification of the law on predetermination and the requirement to register and declare interests

  * major infrastructure projects
  * updated final impact assessment for the Community Infrastructure Levy
  * local plan reform
  * compulsory pre-application consultation between prospective developers and local communities
  * enforcement package
  * neighbourhood plans and community Right to Build

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1794971,Localism Bill starts a new era of people power,"A landmark bill that heralds a ground-breaking shift in power to councils and communities overturning decades of central government control was unveiled by Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today.

The Localism Bill will put an end to the hoarding of power within central government and top-down control of communities, allowing local people the freedom to run their lives and neighbourhoods in their own way.

The Bill, laid before Parliament today, contains a radical package of reforms that will devolve greater power and freedoms to councils and neighbourhoods, establish powerful new rights for communities, revolutionise the planning system, and give communities control over housing decisions.

The legislation will help build the Big Society by radically transforming the relationships between central government, local government, communities and individuals.

For councils the Bill will fundamentally change their freedom to act in the interest of their local communities through a new general power of competence. Rather than needing to rely on specific powers, the new power will give councils the legal reassurance and confidence to innovate, drive down costs to deliver more efficient services.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Localism Bill will herald a ground-breaking shift in power to councils and communities overturning decades of central government control and starting a new era of people power.
> 
> ""It is the centrepiece of what this Government is trying to do to fundamentally shake up the balance of power in this country. For too long, everything has been controlled from the centre - and look where it's got us. Central government has kept local government on a tight leash, strangling the life out of councils in the belief that bureaucrats know best.
> 
> ""By getting out of the way and letting councils and communities run their own affairs we can restore civic pride, democratic accountability and economic growth - and build a stronger, fairer Britain. It's the end of the era of big government: laying the foundations for the Big Society.""

The Localism Bill contains further measures to strengthen local democracy by:

  * **Devolving significant new powers to councils -** In a major transfer of power from Whitehall to town halls, councils will be freed from bureaucratic constraints with new freedoms and flexibilities to act in the best interests of their area. Councillors will have to approve and be required to publish new chief executive pay rules at full Council that management will have to follow. Councillors will no longer be prevented from voting on campaign issues; and there will be a new power to create directly elected mayors in 12 cities giving residents a say in a strong democratically elected leader;
  * **Establishing powerful new rights for local people and communities** - powers for councils are accompanied by greater powers for local people to hold their local authorities to account. Local people and communities' will have real power and a bigger say over their area through a new right to challenge to take over services; a new right to bid to buy local assets such as libraries, pubs and shops; a new right to veto excessive council tax rises through a referendum. Bin tax laws repealed;
  * **Radically reforming planning** - Ministers believe the current planning system is too centralised and bureaucratic, too adversarial and remote from the communities it affects. The Bill will restore democratic and local control over planning by replacing the Infrastructure Planning Commission with an efficient and democratically accountable system for major infrastructure. The Bill will enable regional planning to be swept away and in its place neighbourhood plans will become the new building blocks of the planning system where communities have the power to grant planning permission if a local majority are in favour;
  * **Making housing fairer and more democratic** - The Bill will return decision-making powers on housing to local councils and communities through a new Community Right to Build giving communities the freedom they need in order to come together to build new homes & amenities in their towns & villages. Home Information Packs will be formally scrapped. The Bill will put councils in charge of allocation and tenure of social housing, giving councils the flexibility to use their social housing stock to the maximum effect and reduce waiting lists., It will be easier for social tenants to relocate though a new National Homeswap Scheme, and councils will be able to offer flexible solutions to people at risk of homelessness. The Housing Revenue Account Subsidy System will be replaced with a more transparent system that serves local communities. Tenants will be able to scrutinise the services offered by their landlords and hold them to account. The Tenant Services Authority will be abolished but its vital economic regulation functions will be preserved;
  * **Creating powerful incentives for economic growth** - The Bill will give local government a stronger financial stake in the local economy, helping rebalance the economy, so it is more entrepreneurial and attracts local business by allowing local authorities to grant discretionary business rate discounts; making small business tax breaks easier take advantage of; giving affected businesses a greater say in rate supplements and cancelling certain backdated business rates including port taxes.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""This Bill will provide the enduring legislative foundation for a new, decentralised Britain, where power is returned to the people to which it belongs. We believe that communities should have the freedom to manage their own affairs in their way, and be empowered, not suppressed, by Government. The Bill will enact new rights allowing local people to shape and influence the places where they live, revolutionising the planning process by passing power down to those who know best about their neighbourhoods.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps added:

> ""With housebuilding at its lowest peacetime level since 1924, the time is right for radical shake up of the entire system. The Bill will end top-down targets - in their place communities with the vision and drive to build more homes will be given the freedom to achieve their ambitions, and this will be backed up with powerful cash incentives for councils that allow new development in their area.
> 
> ""With five million people languishing on social housing waiting lists, social housing is ripe for reform. Councils will now be able to manage social housing in a way that genuinely meets the needs of local people, and will be able to offer fixed tenancies that give people the helping hand they need, for as long as they need it.""

Communities Minister, Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Localism Bill will pave the way for the long overdue push of powers out of Whitehall to councils and neighbourhoods across the country, and give local communities real control over housing and planning decisions.
> 
> ""Local facilities have been closing down all over the country, leaving towns and villages without vital services.
> 
> ""Small community groups that are willing to take over local assets often find that they lack the time and resources to get a plan together and compete with the might and muscle of big business and developers.
> 
> ""The powerful new rights in the Bill will put real power in the hands of real people, empowering local communities and putting them at the heart of local decision making.""

### Notes to editors

1. Ministers have already started giving councils greater financial freedom, by devolving and streamlining £7 billion more of government funding, removing burdens and bureaucratic controls so that they can prioritise budgets to support public services in ways which meet the priorities of local people and communities, helping to manage demand on services so they are more personalised and effective for vulnerable groups thereby reducing costs to society.

2. The Government also wants to create a new era of accountability and openness where bureaucratic accountability is replaced by democratic accountability. Putting more data in the public domain is central in making this happen and will drive smarter spending.

3. Getting council business out in the open will revolutionise local government and help facilitate the Big Society. Councils are now expected to publish all expenditure over £500 online. Local people should be able to hold their council to account. Greater openness and transparency is absolutely critical to root out waste and inefficiency.

4. General Power of Competence: Local Authorities are creatures of statute - they only have the power to do what Parliament has authorised them to do - unlike a natural person that can do anything except where that power to act is curtailed by law. Since local authorities were first incorporated power has been given to them on a piecemeal basis. Now, with General Power of Competence, local authorities can basically act in that same way as a natural person, except where restricted by statute such as creating a new tax.

5. The Government has today also published _Decentralisation and the Localism Bill: an essential guide_. Its sets out six actions central government will need to take to achieve and maintain the radical shift in power, - in behaviour, expectation, and culture - which must go alongside the changes in law proposed in the Bill. The guide to can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/decentralisationguide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/decentralisationguide).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1845429,"Localism Bill to hand pay power to full council with £100,000 vote","Locally elected councillors should all have to vote on decisions about whether they want to pay staff salaries over £100,000, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles suggested today.

Ministers today signalled their intention to issue new guidance on a salary ceiling at which remuneration decisions should be always brought before a full council vote. Ministers believe that threshold should be set at £100,000.

> ""The changes we are introducing will mean that local government jobs will now have to be 'democracy proofed' before mega salaries are paid out. I think the democratically elected members of any council should make sure they have their say on pay and that £100,000 is the place to start that.""

The Localism Bill includes provisions to require councils to prepare and publish a statement setting out the authority's policy on the remuneration arrangements of its chief officers which must be approved by full council. Big bonuses and above inflation annual pay rises might also have to be included.

This will ensure decisions on senior pay are taken by all the democratically elected councillors in the council at an open meeting, instead of behind closed doors.

The new measures are designed to improve transparency and local democratic accountability in how senior pay is set within local government. Councils must have regard for any guidance issued by the Secretary of State when they carry out their responsibilities on these measures.

The pay bill for top managers in local government was estimated at £626.9m in 2008 by the Local Government Association group, the Local Government Employers.

Last year Mr Pickles called for council chief executives earning over £200,000 to take a ten per cent pay cut and those earning £150,000 - which is more than the Prime Minister's current salary of £142,000 - to take a 5 per cent pay cut.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Councils need to make sure they don't sully their reputation by taking decision behind closed doors to reward chief executives when they should be focusing resources on protecting frontline services.
> 
> ""The changes we are introducing will mean that local government jobs will now have to be 'democracy proofed' before mega salaries are paid out. I think the democratically elected members of any council should make sure they have their say on pay and that £100,000 is the place to start that.
> 
> ""The Localism Bill is one of the most radical pieces of legislation to be debated in Parliament for decades. It prizes democracy over bureaucracy, and our intention is that it should fundamentally shake up the balance of power in this country.""

### Background

1. Provisions are included in the bill that will require local authorities and fire and rescue authorities to approve and publish annually at Full Council (for Fire and Rescue Authorities, a meeting of members), a senior pay policy statement which authorities will be required to follow when setting senior pay. Where councils want to depart from the pay policy, these would need to be referred back to Full Council (or a meeting of members for Fire and Rescue Authorities) to vote on.

2. The statement must include the authority's policies relating to.

> (a) the level and elements of remuneration for each chief officer  
(b) remuneration of chief officers on recruitment  
(c) increases and additions to remuneration for each chief officer  
(d) the use of performance related pay for chief officers  
(e) the use of bonuses for chief officers  
(f) the approach to the payment of chief officers on their ceasing to hold  
office under or to be employed by the authority, and  
(g) the publication of and access to information relating to remuneration of  
chief officers.

3. The term 'remuneration' covers:

> (a) the chief officer's salary or, in the case of a chief officer engaged by the authority under a contract for services, payments made by the authority to the chief officer for those services,  
(b) any bonuses payable by the authority to the chief officer,  
(c) any charges, fees or allowances payable by the authority to the chief officer,  
(d) any benefits in kind to which the chief officer is entitled as a result of the chief officer's office or employment,  
(e) any increase in or enhancement of the chief officer's pension entitlement where the increase or enhancement is as a result of a resolution of the authority, and  
(f) any amounts payable by the authority to the chief officer on the chief officer ceasing to hold office under or be employed by the authority, other than amounts that may be payable by virtue of any enactment.

4. The Bill also includes provision for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on the content and application of senior pay statements. The intention was for this guidance to be used to provide practical support on the practical operation of these measures. Relevant authorities must have regard to this guidance in the exercise of their functions under the pay accountability provisions. However, this guidance cannot impose any absolute requirements on local authorities or fire and rescue authorities, the functions regarding the setting of policies remain theirs to exercise.

5. Evidence shows that senior pay levels have spiralled recently. An Audit Commission report (_Tougher at the Top?_ 2008) found that basic salary levels for single tier and county chief executives increased by 34 per cent between 2003/04 and 2007/08. If performance related pay is included, total pay for private sector chief executives increased by 78 per cent from 2002/03 to 2006/07.

6. According to the Local Government Employers data from the Joint Negotiating Committee's Salaries and Numbers survey 2008 and Setting Rewards for Top Managers in Local Government, the chief officers pay bill is £576.5m and Chief Executives is £50.4m.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1818860,Localism Bill to hand power to the people gains support,"An historic bill to return power to councils and communities reversing decades of increasing central government control was given new backing today.

The Localism Bill will mark a revolution in the way the country works by putting power back into the hands of the people through a radical package of reforms and new freedoms.

A wide range of organisations, from civic and community groups and business leaders to housing and planning professionals and local authorities, have thrown their weight behind the Bill as it starts its second reading in Parliament today.

To make sure the general public and community groups can fully understand the effects of the Bill, a plain English guide has also been published today.

The guide seeks to translate complex legal language used in the 207 clause Bill in a transparent and reader friendly way, so anyone can understand how the Bill will devolve greater power and freedoms to councils and neighbourhoods, establish powerful new rights for communities, revolutionise the planning system, and give communities control over housing decisions.

Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Localism Bill is one of the most radical pieces of legislation to be debated in this chamber for decades. It is a triumph for democracy over bureaucracy.
> 
> ""It will fundamentally shake up the balance of power in this country. It represents everything this Government stands for and is the cornerstone for everything we want to do. It will revitalise local democracy and put power back where it belongs - in the hands of the people.
> 
> ""For too long, Government has believed that Whitehall was the centre of the universe. We genuinely believe in local democracy, in local communities, and in local solutions.
> 
> ""This Bill will give councils the power and the authority they need to make sensible decisions for the area - a shot in the arm for local democracy - and it will give people new rights, new powers, new opportunities to act on the issues that matter to them.
> 
> ""By pushing power out, getting Government out of the way, letting people run their own affairs; we can build a stronger, fairer Britain.""

Decentralisation Minster Greg Clark added:

> ""This Bill represents nothing less than a reshaping of the constitutional settlement - a new page in the relationship between the people and government. It is based on belief in the ingenuity of local leaders, pride in the strength of local democracy and respect for people's common sense. It will give free rein to the ambitions and commitment of all the people who want to play their part in making their neighbourhood a better place to live.""

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice said:

> ""The fundamental 'power shift' to local communities intended by the Localism Bill will be applauded by civic societies and other community groups whose skills, knowledge and expertise have been undervalued for too long. With the right safeguards and support Civic Voice relishes the opportunities being provided for communities to take the lead in planning and shaping the future of the places where we all live.""

Liz Peace, Chief Executive of the British Property Federation added:

> ""There has been a lot of hysterical comment on the impact of the localism agenda on the property industry. The Bill has gone some way to countering this and whilst there is still much that remains to be resolved we are re-assured by the emphasis that the Government is now placing on growth and the way in which localism is to be used as the vehicle for encouraging communities to opt, not for nimbyism, but for the sustainable development of both the homes and commercial property that our economy so desperately needs.""

Sarah Webb, Chief Executive of Chartered Institute of Housing said:

> ""The Localism Bill will bring in some major changes for the housing sector and its tenants. The extra flexibility being offered around approaches to housing and planning within local communities is timely recognition of the expertise and professionalism in the housing sector. Aspects of the Bill will help improve housing professionals' capacity to develop tailored and effective local solutions to challenging housing problems, and we look forward to working with Parliamentarians to finesse the Bill at and beyond its second reading.""

Cllr Michael Chater, chairman of the National Association of Local Councils said:

> ""We welcome the positive ambitions of the Localism Bill to drive power and decision making down to communities. Local (community, neighbourhood, parish and town community) councils will be greatly encouraged by their enhanced recognition and the opportunities to serve local people through greater influence in planning, housing, social and economic regeneration and community well being.""

Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the Town and Country Planning Association said:

> ""Localism is an opportunity to be grasped. The drive towards community based planning is a long standing TCPA objective and we welcome the determination to reconnect the system to the people it serves. We must seek to shape a planning system which is responsive to people's needs and aspirations and promotes sustainable development.""

Chris Wade, Chief Executive of Action for Market Towns said:

> ""This welcome Bill is a huge step forward in the drive to put greater decision making powers and more funding decisions in the hands of local people. We have long championed community-led planning in its broadest sense and our experience shows that with determination and a little guidance communities are ready to take control. The Bill will give more weight to communities' carefully informed views on issues that affect them and the services they use.""

ResPublica Deputy Director Ash Singh said:

> ""The Localism Bill puts people and communities in control. Social enterprises and civil society organisations can articulate the problems in a given community - as well the solutions to those problems - far more effectively than the Man in Whitehall and the Government gets this. The new community rights to buy, to bid, to build and to know, and the commitments to enable more civil society organisations to deliver public services should help to reverse decades of centralisation and inefficiency.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1937784,Localism is key to improved resilience says Fire Minister Bob Neill,"Bob Neill has announced next steps after the consultation on the future of fire and rescue control centres throughout England. This follows the cancellation of the FiReControl project which aimed to replace 46 local control centres with nine regional centres.

In total, 61 submissions were received from the public consultation exercise, mainly from fire and rescue authorities and services and suppliers in the fire and rescue industry.

A broad consensus emerged from the responses, especially around the Government's preferred approach of increased collaboration. The Government's commitment not to impose any central solution was particularly welcomed.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""First I would like to thank all those who responded to the consultation, and the valuable contribution made by the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Local Government Group to our next steps. The great majority of those responding to the consultation agreed with the Government's preferred approach of achieving improved resilience and efficiency through encouraging increased collaboration in a locally-determined way - with some Government support. Our strategy for the future is to build national resilience through local solutions.
> 
> ""I have today announced that total funding of £81million will be made available to England's Fire and Rescue Authorities to help them develop their own solutions for improving resilience and efficiency - as a guide, that's up to £1.8million each. More may be available where plans offer exceptional benefits but within the £81million total. A further £1.8million will support cross cutting initiatives that enhance resilience and efficiency, such as the development of common standards.""

Securing national resilience and ensuring public safety against national risks is the primary focus of central Government in its ongoing relationship with the Fire and Rescue Services. The Department will work with the sector to develop and consult on a new National Framework. This will define national and local resilience roles, including issues arising in the context of cross-border working interoperability, and multi-agency interoperability. Discussions will include considering a national communications capability and standards for data exchange.

### Notes to Editors:

  1. On 20 December 2010, Fire Minister Bob Neill MP announced the termination of the main IT contract and closure of the FiReControl project. The project began in 2004, following a short consultation, and had aimed to replace England's 46 standalone fire and rescue control rooms with a national network of nine resilient control centres. The contract was terminated because the contractor EADS Defence and Security (now trading as Cassidian) Ltd could not meet the requirements of the project within an acceptable timeframe.
  2. Fire and Rescue Authorities have a statutory duty to respond to emergency fire and rescue calls and mobilise appropriate resources to incidents under the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004. Throughout the project Fire and Rescue Authorities continued to be funded via traditional funding streams to maintain and replace their control room systems in order to fulfil their statutory duty. The FiReControl project was included in the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework 2008-11.
  3. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) consulted on the future of fire and rescue control services in England from 13 January to 8 April 2011.
  4. The consultation document can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices) and the response document at [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/controlservicessummaryresponses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/controlservicessummaryresponses).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1834889,Localism to spark growth revival,"The Localism Bill is unashamedly pro-growth and will once and for all deal with the problems that have led to a crisis in development in this country, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark has said.

Mr Clark said the single most important test for each provision in the Bill was whether it helped to promote and unlock growth.

Instead of tinkering around the edges, the Bill was designed to fundamentally overhaul a flawed system that has pitted communities against development, with housebuilding at its lowest level in any peacetime year since 1924, Mr Clark said in a speech to the Adam Smith Institute (see link, top right).

Mr Clark said the major obstacle to growth has been a planning system that has led to a rising tide of resistance to development by shutting communities out of the process.

The Localism Bill will be a huge opportunity to reboot the planning system making it pro-growth and pro-development, by allowing much greater involvement of communities from the outset to shape their neighbourhood and to share directly in the rewards of growth, not just the costs, Mr Clark said.

For every home built, the local authority will get six years of matched council tax funding, through the new homes bonus - to use locally whether to keep council tax at an affordable level, invest in homes, or improve services, Mr Clark said.

And councils will be required to ensure that a significant proportion of the charge raised through the Community Infrastructure Levy is spent in the neighbourhood where the development takes place, to improve parks and schools, playgrounds and cycle-paths.

Mr Clark said the Bill will restore meaningful public participation in planning by stripping out the regional bureaucracy that imposed decisions on communities. New neighbourhood plans will allow communities to shape a vision for their area - where new homes, schools and shops will go - and be able to bring it into force through a local referendum.

Mr Clark said:

> ""The Localism Bill is unashamedly pro-growth. Everything within it is designed to unlock the barriers to growth that have led to a crisis in development, with housebuilding at its lowest level in any peacetime year since 1924.
> 
> ""The huge opportunity of the Bill is to reboot the planning system so it is no longer one of the major obstacles to growth. We have got into a disastrous situation where communities have become pitted against development by being shut out of the process and seeing only the costs, never the benefits.
> 
> ""By allowing communities to share directly in the rewards of growth and giving them the chance to shape a positive future for their areas, the Bill will create the conditions where people begin to welcome rather than resist growth.""

Alongside changes to increase efficiency in the planning system, measures in the Localism Bill will give local government a stronger financial stake in the local economy, helping rebalance the economy.

Councils will be more entrepreneurial and better placed to attract local business through:

  * flexibilities to grant discretionary business rate discounts;

  * making small business tax breaks easier to take advantage of;

  * giving affected businesses a greater say in rate supplements; and

  * cancelling certain backdated business rates including port taxes.

In addition, ministers are pursuing a programme of reform to:

  * reduce the burden of regulations on the housebuilding sector;
  * establish a growing network of Local Enterprise Partnerships, helping to create a fairer and more balanced economy driven by private sector strength; and
  * examine options to enable councils to retain their locally-raised business rates, providing incentives for them to promote economic growth through the business rates system.

Last November, the Government also launched the Growth Review to provide a fundamental assessment of what each part of Government is doing to provide the conditions for private sector success.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1742210,London 2012 sets new world standard on Olympic legacy,"London is breaking new ground in preparing for the legacy of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games according to a new report published today.

The report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) concluded that ""few cities will have prepared for Olympic Legacy as directly and consciously as London has"" and that ""a new international standard"" for hosting major events and large scale regeneration is being set by London.

The OECD report -  part of the LEED (Local Economic and Employment Development) Programme - hailed the unprecedented and extraordinary range of activities that are going ahead to build a lasting Olympic legacy for the communities of East London, highlighting the huge range of local benefits that will result from large-scale regeneration activity.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill, who leads for Government on the Olympic Legacy for East London, welcomed the findings, which highlighted in particular:

  * early creation of the Olympic Park Legacy Company to deliver a lasting physical and socio-economic legacy for local people starting with the creation of the Legacy Vision
  * the five local authorities in the Olympic area working together to secure joint and lasting benefits from London 2012 for their constituents through their Strategic Regeneration Framework
  * the work of the Olympic Delivery Authority in creating a lasting environmental legacy, world class standards in sustainable construction, and high calibre facilities
  * the increased opportunities for small and medium enterprises to win high value contracts in East London
  * the improved transport links that open up employment opportunities to local people.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Everybody is working hard to ensure that the reach of London 2012 goes far beyond the games. Today's report from the OECD has confirmed we are on the right track. We've learned from both the successes and failures of our predecessors and this report can help us take the next steps toward triumph.
> 
> ""It's clear that the OECD share the Government's view that communities know best how to meet their area's needs and ambitions. We've already begun to put control of Legacy decisions back into local authorities' and the Mayor of London's hands and there's still more to do.
> 
> ""I look forward to seeing the Mayor of London, boroughs and local businesses working together to secure an Olympic legacy for East London that we can all be proud of.""

The OECD's study was informed by a think piece report undertaken in 2009 by the University of East London (UEL). The report, which looked at the socio-economic conditions in the Olympic Host Boroughs, and the possible opportunities for creating a lasting legacy, is also being published today.

This month the Government's long-term commitment to the Olympic Legacy was also emphasised through the Olympic Park Legacy Company's twenty year vision for the newly named Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

### Notes to Editors

2. The independent report was commissioned in Autumn 2009 and the work carried out between late 2009 and mid 2010. The study consisted of a series of site visits and stakeholder and workshops, followed by the experts' reports on the progress of London 2012 and its legacy planning.

3. The think piece report _London's Olympic Legacy. A ""Think piece"" report prepared for the OECD and Department of Communities and Local Government_ from the University of East London is available at: [http://www.uel.ac.uk/londoneast/.](http://www.uel.ac.uk/londoneast/)

4. The UEL study was written by Professor Gavin Poynter and Dr Iain Macrury of the University of East London and completed in late 2009. It was commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government to provide a local socio-economic and policy context to inform the OECD expert Review of London 2012 legacy.

5. The UEL report set out to answer three questions:

> 1. What are the key socio-economic problems in the five host boroughs?
> 
> 2. What could the London 2012 legacy look like? (Based on the evidence of previous games and similar major events, best practice, and the plans and preparations that have been made to date)
> 
> 3. Do we have the appropriate governance arrangements to maximise legacy benefits?

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2082928,"London to take control of its Olympic legacy, public land and funding","In an historic settlement for Londoners, Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles has today announced £3 billion of funding for the Greater London Authority for housing and regeneration in London.

These responsibilities reflect the Mayor of London's new powers and have been transferred to the Greater London Authority following the Localism Act 2011.

From this April, and in line with Government's commitment to decentralise power away from Whitehall, the Mayor of London - and not Ministers - will be accountable for the capital's affordable housing programmes including key development sites like the Greenwich Peninsula, and east London's Olympic legacy.

The £3 billion funding supports the Mayor's four year commitment to build 55,000 affordable homes by March 2015, and to bring 45,000 existing social homes up to standard across London, as well as supporting the Mayor's plans for the Olympic Park.

The current Olympic land and debt deal, first agreed in March 2010, will also be replaced by new receipt sharing arrangements for the Olympic Park to reflect the devolution of Olympic legacy to the Mayor and to protect the interests of the taxpayer.

Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""This settlement hands real power to London allowing Londoners to manage their own affairs. It goes hand in hand with the new localism powers and spending freedoms we are handing councils around the country so they can be as efficient and effective as possible with public funds.
> 
> ""The lasting legacy from the Olympics will showcase the regeneration and house building achievements that ensures London remains a truly great city.""

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:

> ""This is a landmark agreement that sees responsibility and accountability for housing and regeneration resting squarely with London. We are now in a great position to drive forward vital investment that will deliver more affordable homes across the city, secure a lasting legacy in the Olympic Park and create thousands of new jobs. I will do all I can to grasp the fantastic opportunities this settlement provides and ensure that London becomes an even better place to live, work and invest in.""

### Notes to editors

1. The London reforms in Localism Act 2011 will:

  * devolve the activities of the Homes and Communities Agency in London to the Greater London Authority (in April 2012), including the management of London's affordable housing programmes

  * abolish the London Development Agency and transfer its activities to the Authority (by 31 March 2012); and

  * enable the Mayor of London to establish a Mayoral Development Corporation to oversee the long term development of the Olympic Park and surrounding area (by 1 April 2012).

2. The £3 billion for the Greater London Authority covers the spending review period up to 2014-15 and includes: £390 million resource funding; £1,941 million capital investment for housing; and £481 million capital investment for the transformation and development of the Olympic Park after the Games. This funding will be funded from the Department for Communities Local Government from existing resources for housing, Regional Development Agency closure and Olympic legacy.

3. The Greater London Authority will become responsible for all of the Homes and Communities Agency's land and property assets in London, with Department for Communities and Local Government continuing to receive a 50 per cent share of receipts from Greenwich Peninsula (the Homes Communities Agency's largest asset) reflecting the significant national investment in this site over the last 15 years.

4. The Olympic receipts sharing arrangement will enable:

  * the Greater London Authority to fund any further capital investment in the Park and surrounding area, as well as cover the repayment of the residual debt the Authority will inherit from the London Development Agency; and
  * National Lottery distributors to be reimbursed for their additional £675 million contribution to Olympic Public Sector Funding package.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2110293,"Lose some sleep but save a life this weekend: when you change your clock, test your smoke alarm","The Fire Kills campaign is urging people to make a potentially life-saving move when they change their clocks on Sunday 25 March - by taking a moment to test their smoke alarm too.

![A burning clock](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2110266.jpg)When you change your clock, test your smoke alarm campaign

Love it or loathe it, the twice-yearly clock change is a routine part of everyone's lives. Losing that extra hour's sleep on Sunday 25 March may not be appealing, but turning the clocks forward will already be on the 'to-do' list of nearly all UK households.

But while we all keep our clocks up-to-time and working, it's shocking to realise that many people don't bother to do the simplest of tests to ensure the safety of themselves and their loved ones from the danger of fire.

A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. But just half of all householders who own a smoke alarm say that they test it to make sure it's working on a regular basis.

You're four times more likely to die in a fire if your smoke alarm is not working. So it's clear that the simple act of testing your alarm should be a vital part of any household routine.

There were 31,477 accidental fires in the home in England last year, which resulted in 214 deaths and 6,526 injuries. The Fire Kills Campaign hopes that by adding this simple check to everyone's clock-change routine, many more lives could be saved.

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Everyone soon notices when a clock stops ticking, but it's not so easy to be sure that your smoke alarm is still in working order. Whether the battery is flat, has been removed for a kid's toy or the connection is loose, everyone should take the time to test their smoke alarm - it doesn't take long at all.
> 
> ""You're four times more likely to die in a fire without a working smoke alarm, but only half of people who own one say they take the time to check it regularly.
> 
> ""We're all losing sleep at the start of British Summer Time, but testing your smoke alarm could save you from losing a lot more. As you put your clocks forward over the weekend, take an extra moment to push the button - it could save your life.""

Chief Executive of The Fire Fighters Charity John Parry said:

> ""Our charity aims to make a positive difference by supporting people in the fire and rescue community when they are in need. We know just how hard the fire service works to prevent fires from starting in the first place, so we are urging people to heed the advice of their local fire fighters now that British Summer Time is upon us. When you put your clocks forward this March, please take an extra moment to push the button on your smoke alarm to make sure it's working properly - it could save your life and that of your family.""

Listen out for radio and press adverts supporting the 'When you change your clocks, Test your smoke alarm' campaign. An online video has also been released showing a mantelpiece clock melting in the heat of a house fire - bringing home the harsh reality of the consequences of a fire in the home.

If you have an elderly relative or are a carer for somebody less able to test their smoke alarm, why not offer to do it for them? It only takes a minute.

Help keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the home by following these simple steps:

  * A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. Make sure you fit one on every level of your home and test them regularly.
  * Make testing your smoke alarm part of your household routine. Test the alarm by pressing the button regularly; change your battery once a year or invest in a 10-year alarm; and clean the alarm casing twice a year to ensure dust isn't blocking the sensor.
  * Whatever happens, never remove the battery in your smoke alarm.
  * Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do in a fire and practise your escape route.
  * For more information visit the Fire Kills campaign's Facebook page at [www.facebook.com/firekills](https://www.facebook.com/firekills) (external link).

If you want an extra nudge to test your smoke alarm regularly, try setting an automatic reminder. Safelincs, in partnership with Fire Kills, has created a free service that reminds you, by email or text, when it's time to test your smoke alarm, change the battery or renew the unit. The service is completely free and can be cancelled at any time: [www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders](http://www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders/) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1620936,Lower Council Taxes and rates for hard-working families and local firms,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has hailed today's Budget for providing lower council taxes and rates for hard-working families and local firms.

The measures announced by Chancellor George Osborne will bring around £1.1 billion of benefits to local people, including: 

  * A council tax freeze worth up to £70 for the average family
  * £175 million refund for hard pressed businesses including some in ports
  * Confirmation of £390 million in business rate relief for half a million small businesses

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Budget is good news for hard pressed local businesses and council tax payers who will benefit by up to £1.1 billion.
> 
> ""This Budget demonstrates that the new Government has kept its promises on council tax and business taxes.""

### Council tax frozen

The Government will work in partnership with local authorities in England to implement a freeze in council tax in 2011-12. This will benefit all households who pay council tax in England as the economy recovers.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Council tax bills have more than doubled in the last thirteen years while frontline services like bin collections were halved. Rocketing council tax has to stop, to offer real help to struggling families and pensioners.
> 
> ""The new Government is delivering on our promise to work with councils and freeze council tax next year - worth up to £70 on a typical Band D home - a real victory for hard-pressed taxpayers.
> 
> ""We will make it possible for local authorities to freeze or reduce their council tax, and still protect vital local services, thanks to this budget commitment, our reduction in Whitehall bureaucracy and new freedoms for councils to spend their money on local priorities.""

### The Government has kept its promise to cancel port taxes

Ministers welcomed confirmation in the Budget of legislation to waive £175 million of backdated business rates demands levied on businesses including some in ports. These unfair, retrospective rates bills threatened to devastate the industry, and cause significant knock-on harm to the manufacturing sector. This could benefit businesses in an estimated 3,000 properties. Alongside this we estimate that ratepayers occupying up to an estimated 700 properties in ports could also benefit from this waiver. The department will look to bring forward primary legislation at the earliest opportunity.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""The dark tax cloud that has been hanging over some port businesses, the backbone of Britain's export industry, for too long has finally been lifted.   
   
""The Chancellor's decision to waive and repay the unexpected rates bills for those affected port businesses is a victory for common sense. Many companies across the country will be able to move forward confidently, unburdened by these unexpected debts.""

In addition to help small businesses rebuild the economy the Budget announced that small business rate relief will be doubled saving over half a million businesses £390 million in taxes.

The level of small business rate relief (SBRR) in England will be temporarily increased for one year, from 1 October 2010. 530,000 businesses in England are expected to benefit, with approximately 345,000 businesses paying no rates.

Bob Neill added:

> ""We need to inject new life into the private sector, so that enterprise can drive recovery and re-build the economy. Today we are helping over half a million small businesses with our low business tax promise that will free them up to compete and grow.""

### Notes

Council tax in England is currently £1,439 on an average Band D home. Stopping a 5 per cent council tax rise (the last Government's capping threshold in recent years) would save £72 next year.

Stopping a 2.9 per cent rise (the average increase over the last three years) would save around £40 on an average Band D home, or around £35 based on the alternative 'average per dwelling' measure.

Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11 (DCLG press release, 24 March 2010). By contrast, council tax was £688 in 1997-98 (DoE press release, 20 March 1997). This means council tax has risen 109 per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, every type of home has seen their bill more than double.

Scotland has frozen council tax, England has lost out. Scotland benefited from yet another council tax freeze this year, meaning the average bill for a comparative Band D home in Scotland will be £290 less than south of the border in 2010-11.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2110436,"Manchester City Deal brings 6,000 jobs boost","Greater Manchester will create and protect 6,000 jobs as the city signs an innovative deal with central government giving it new powers to create jobs and train local people with the right skills to fill them, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Cities Minister Greg Clark have announced today.

These powers, including the ability to 'earn back' a portion of the additional tax generated by investing in infrastructure, have been agreed as part of the City Deals initiative, which sees cities bid for powers to free them from Whitehall controls in order to boost growth locally. Manchester is the first ever city in the country to secure such powers and will be able to reinvest the money in local economic development and infrastructure.

The city has calculated that the deal will lead to 3,800 new jobs for local people and will protect 2,300 existing jobs.

The deal will permit Greater Manchester to 'earn back' up to £30 million a year of tax for growth it creates. Under the scheme, Manchester will invest £1.2 billion in improving infrastructure such as transport. This is the first time that a UK city has had the freedom to reinvest its own national tax revenues.

The deal will help the city drive growth and create opportunities that will benefit the whole Greater Manchester area. It includes new initiatives on housing, skills, regional growth, business support and the environment.

City Deals are being negotiated with the eight 'core cities', the largest and most economically important English cities outside of London. Each city is able to specify the particular powers they need and want to boost local growth. Negotiations are ongoing with the other core cities.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg said:

> ""This deal breaks new ground, giving Manchester the freedom to be truly revolutionary - 'earning back' tax for growth it creates.
> 
> ""I congratulate the city on its innovative approach that will see it grow - jobs, skills, transport, and housing - for the benefit of everyone who lives there.
> 
> ""In recognition of this excellence, I am pleased that the government can cut Whitehall ties and devolve power to Manchester.""

Cities Minister, Greg Clark said:

> ""We've said to each City 'make us an offer'. Tell us how you can drive growth in ways that have not been tried before, or which harness your city's unique strengths in new ways.
> 
> ""For our whole nation to prosper our cities must also unlock the potential of all of the citizens within them. I am especially pleased that this 'Deal' includes the truly innovative 'Earn Back' model which allows Manchester to reinvest the benefits of its own entrepreneurship. This is just the kind of ground breaking response that we are keen to encourage.""

The key elements of Manchester proposals are:

  * To create a 'revolving Infrastructure Fund', allowing Greater Manchester to 'earn back' a portion of the tax it generates by investing £1.2 billion in infrastructure, on a payment-by-results basis.

  * To establish a Greater Manchester Investment Framework to make the best use of funding from central government, European funding, and private sector funding to drive economic growth. Investment will be prioritised on the basis of Gross Value Added and jobs per pound of public funding.

  * To create a City Apprenticeship and Skills Hub to increase the number of apprenticeships for 16-24 year olds by 10 per cent to 6,000 by channelling funding direct to employers, in particular small and medium sized businesses. To strengthen Greater Manchester's Business Growth Hub which gives trade, investment and business advice to local companies, with Government contributing £4.4 million of transitional funding, prior to local funding from Enterprise Zone revenues coming on-stream from 2015. The city says this will create 3,800 new jobs and safeguard 2,300 jobs.

  * Develop Manchester's role as a beacon for high value inward investment. Developing markets in China, India and Graphene technologies especially.

  * Establish a Low Carbon Hub to integrate multiple carbon reduction measures. The Department for Environment and Climate Change will support Greater Manchester to achieve a 48 per cent carbon reduction target by 2020.

  * Establish Greater Manchester Housing Investment Board to set up an investment fund, to drive the building of 5,000-7,000 new homes by 2017.

  * Commit Government and Greater Manchester to work together to deliver improved transport services by devolving the Northern franchises, bus improvement, including the devolution of central subsidies and smart ticketing.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2085395,Mayoral referendum election date confirmed,"Ballot boxes will open on 3 May 2012 for voters to decide on directly elected mayors for England's largest cities, Ministers confirmed today.

The Government believes that elected mayors can provide cities with the strong, visible leadership that will help them prosper nationally and internationally.

The Coalition Agreement proposed the creation of directly elected mayors in the 12 largest cities outside of London, subject to confirmatory referendum and full scrutiny by elected councillors.

Leicester has already elected a mayor and Liverpool has decided, following a resolution of the City Council, to move a mayoral form of government and hold an election for a mayor.

In the 10 remaining cities - in Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle Upon -Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefield, referendums will take place on 3 May 2012 for local people to decide whether to have a directly elected mayor. Liverpool's election will also take place on the same day.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Elected mayors can provide the strong, visible leadership to help our cities to prosper, attracting investment and jobs from home and abroad.
> 
> ""Our greatest cities can benefit from the prestige and international standing a mayor can bring, helping them to achieve their full potential.
> 
> ""For Britain to be successful our cities need to be successful. An elected mayor with a strong voice can seize the opportunities for their city to compete on the world stage.""

Following the approval of Parliament, orders have today come into force giving the go-ahead for mayoral referendums. Where people vote in favour, the city will move to an elected mayor and hold elections on 15 November 2012.

The legal foundation for the role of directly elected mayors is the Government's Localism Act, which contains a wide range of decentralising measures. Mayors will have a crucial role to play in shaping the ongoing process of reform - negotiating with Ministers to specify and secure the specific powers that each community needs to prosper.

### Notes to editors

1. The Coalition Agreement set out a commitment to create directly elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities outside London, subject to confirmatory referendums and full scrutiny by elected councillors. The Localism Act empowers local people to decide whether they want an elected mayor for their city. Mayoral referendums are being held on local Election Day on 3 May 2012.

2. If a city votes in favour of having a mayor at its referendum, that city will then hold an election for its first mayor on 15 November 2012. Mayors would be elected for four year terms.

3. Leicester elected their mayor in 2011. Liverpool plan to elect their mayor in May 2012.

This year is particularly significant in that the Middlesex Regiment's battle at Albuhera took place on 16 May 1811 and this week marks the 200th anniversary of one of the bravest acts of chivalry and courage ever witnessed by a regiment of the British army when 'The Diehards' took on and held back the might of Napoleon in the Peninsula Wars. This is why 16 May was chosen as Middlesex Day.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""Middlesex retains its place in people's memories and affections, despite attempts to wipe it off the map. The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

John Randall MP said:

> ""I am absolutely delighted that the Department of Communities and Local Government has been recognising our historic British counties. For those of us fortunate to be from Middlesex to see our county flag flying bravely on Middlesex Day from a Government building is a great moment. This will show that although the county is no longer an administrative county it is very much still a part of our nation. We can celebrate too the exploits of those brave men who fought 200 years ago at the Battle of Albuhera and our flag will help to keep their proud memory and our county's history alive for future generations.""

Middlesex county campaigner and author of _The Real Counties of Great Britain_, Russell Grant said:

> ""Middlesex was first founded in Saxon documentation in 704 AD in a geographical description of Twickenham as being in Middlesex. Since local government counties were only created in 1889, it is a pity that over a thousand years of local heritage and national history of our counties, such as Middlesex, is lost because of a lack of a short-lived County Council. Of course, the County of Middlesex - an entirely separate and different entity - continues to exist as it has done for 1300 years but the lack of understanding of modern media and by-passing of local history in our schools has created an historical and geographical vacuum. We hope, in time, our Government will right the wrongs of previous administrations by protecting the identity and integrity of our counties that are at the very fabric of our English nationhood.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1923344,Minister calls on councils to get ready for proposed new powers to help homeless families,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on councils to start forging closer links with landlords and letting agents in their area so they can better support families at risk of homelessness.

Proposals in the Localism Bill will mean that rather than having the uncertainty of long waits in temporary accommodation, homeless families can be instead helped to find a suitable, safe and secure home in the private rented sector.

Speaking to the LGA Homelessness Roundtable, Mr. Shapps said that councils must continue to find ways to help those declared to be statutorily homeless a top priority - and that proposed new powers will allow councils to make better use of the private sector.

Currently, where a family has been accepted as owed the main homelessness duty, they can wait for an offer of social housing. If this is not immediately available, they are accommodated in expensive temporary accommodation.  

So he said that by working with their local landlords and letting agents now, councils can forge links ready for when the proposed new powers come into force - expected to be early next year - and get more homeless families out of temporary accommodation and back on a stable footing faster.

Councils would be able to use private sector accommodation where they are satisfied that it is suitable for the family's needs and is available for at least 12 months. He said not only will this help those declared statutorily homeless, it will also free up social homes for those who need it most - ending the 'scandal' of 1.75 million people on social housing waiting lists.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Councils must be given greater flexibility in meeting the housing needs of their local area. Our proposed reforms will allow councils to make better use of private sector accommodation in providing a safe, secure and stable home to those in greatest need.
> 
> ""But they will need to ensure that vulnerable or at-risk families are not inappropriately housed. And they must ensure that the accommodation is suitable, safe and secure and available for a minimum of 12 months.
> 
> ""The current system is ripe for reform, and the changes we're bringing in will ensure that from now on our social housing helps as many people as possible, protects the most vulnerable in society, and ensures that those in greatest housing need are given priority.""

The changes are part of the most radical reforms to social housing for a generation and will give councils more flexibility to use their social housing stock to the maximum effect and drive down waiting lists.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1738866,Minister discusses growth in England's core cities,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill met with councils representing England's largest economies after London, to discuss ideas to encourage growth.

Mr Neill was in Bristol to speak to members of the Core Cities Group, a network of local authorities in England's largest cities, to discuss how councils and local businesses will lead the way in making full use of their local expertise to improve their economic performance. They also discussed the relationship between core cities and the government going forward and doing more for less.

The Minister then went on a tour of Knowle West Media Centre, an example of how Bristol is leading the way in the digital economy.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""We have a massive inherited problem sorting out the budget deficit and an economy that has become badly unbalanced - we need local solutions from local communities.
> 
> ""Partnerships made up of local authorities and local businesses are best placed to understand how growth can be encouraged in their local economies.
> 
> ""We believe the promotion of enterprise requires local solutions. Strong local partnerships like the core cities will help support their communities and get more for less.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2141954,Minister experiences the skills and jobs legacy that will benefit Stratford,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill saw first hand how a specialist training centre that has helped more than 3,000 people into work, continues to provide opportunities for local people.

The Skills Place Newham based at Westfield Stratford City is a one-stop shop that provides pre and post-employment training in industries such as retail, hospitality and leisure. Mr Neill met some of the local residents benefiting from the training programs and spoke with the staff working to help them move into employment.

The Skills Place Newham focuses on the core skills needed within specific industries and responds to the needs of employers. The courses are designed to help people to build their skills towards finding sustainable employment. It offers advice, career development, apprenticeships and employment that will help ensure a lasting legacy for the local community after the Olympic Games.

In the last year more than 5,000 local residents have received training from Newham and the Skills Place, of which more than 3,000 have subsequently been employed in Westfield Stratford City.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""Skills Place is doing a fantastic job in helping local people gain meaningful employment. The people I have met are a real testament to how the Olympic Games and the subsequent regeneration, is providing opportunities for the people of Newham which will last long after the Games have finished.""

John Burton, Director, Westfield Stratford City, said:

> ""The Skills Place Newham demonstrates how working in partnership and sharing a commitment to create genuine social change can achieve tangible results for the local community. With more than 3,000 local people employed at Westfield Stratford City via the facilities provided at the Skills Place Newham, we are pleased that the Minister chose to visit Westfield Stratford City to see what can be achieved when big business takes its community responsibility seriously.""

The Skills Place Newham is a joint initiative run by employment and training provider Seetec in partnership with Westfield Stratford City and Newham Workplace. Bob Neill visited on Tuesday, 8 May 2012.

Visiting The Shoulder of Mutton in Kirkby Overblow Mr Neill met the licensees - Kate and David to hear why they combined the local village shop with the village pub. Kate and David explained the merger created a successful business and also preserved a vital local asset, retaining local employment and providing the community with an important focal point.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""We all know the name of our local pub, and we want to give people the opportunity to run it. They are often at the heart of our rural communities, and play an important role in bringing a community together.
> 
> ""This government is committed to ensuring that citizens and communities can get on and do things for themselves, which for too long the stranglehold of bureaucracy has stopped.""

Community groups will be given the opportunity to take over closing or failing pubs and run them as community pubs. Under new powers in the 'Community right to build' initiative, to be included in the forthcoming Localism bill, communities will bid to take on local assets and facilities where they are up for sale - giving real power back to them.

There are many great examples of the community stepping in when their pub is under threat:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1705898,Minister hails Bristol as the street party capital,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today hailed Bristol the street party capital of England as a host of community events are held throughout the city.

This weekend's street parties will bring the total held in Bristol this year to more than 120, involving over 10,000 people - more than in any year since 1977.

In the past, people trying to organise a small event may have encountered a host of obstacles, including high costs, a multitude of forms and guidelines. Last month Communities Secretary Eric Pickles made it much easier and there is now simple guidance and one straightforward form to fill in.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""The people of Bristol are clearly converts to the positive impact a street party can have on an area giving opportunities to collaborate and increasing the community spirit - not to mention how much fun they are.
> 
> ""Bristol has shown that it's a trailblazer in this area. But there's no reason other cities can't follow Bristol's lead. Street parties don't cost councils anything but can help create the strong communities that benefit everyone.
> 
> ""The guidance and simple form we're encouraging people to use makes it easier than ever for councils and organisers to make parties happen.""

Streets Alive, a group that promotes street parties as a way of engaging with local communities, helped facilitate some of this weekend's events, though residents themselves coordinated and funded them.

Bristol City Council's pioneering efforts to make the process as simple as possible have paid off, with the number of street parties in the city growing each year.

Jon Rogers, Cabinet Member for Care and Health at Bristol City Council, said:

> ""Street parties are an important part of what makes Bristol great. We have cut back on red tape, kept costs down and do all we can to encourage communities to come together in a spirit of celebration. I am not surprised Bristol is leading the country.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1713461,Minister launches package of practical advice for market stalls at NABMA Conference,"A new package of practical advice and training for traditional market traders was announced in a speech to the industry by Coalition Markets Minister Andrew Stunell today.

Speaking at the annual NABMA Conference in Buxton, the Minister said a well run market can be a hub of social activity, a centre of community enterprise, tourist asset and a focal meeting point for local people. Markets have a key role in helping to build stronger communities and the 'Big Society'.

Despite this, recent studies show that while speciality markets like farmer's markets thrive, some traditional retail markets are struggling with the growth of out-of-town supermarkets, the recession and internet shopping.

To help address this Mr Stunell announced a trio of measures, brought together by the Government and the industry, to support existing markets and help potential enterprising traders get started:

  * A practical advice guide for markets: highlighting their benefits, areas of good practice and pointing traders to more detailed information on specific concerns
  * A market management report: examining the pros and cons of various ways in which markets can be managed so councils and private operators can see which is the best model for them
  * Business support: 15 training modules and guides that will be launched by the National Market Traders Federation next month to support new and existing traders.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Markets have been the birthplace of towns and cities in this country and across the world. English markets founded over a 1000 years ago are still going strong. Today markets sit at the heart of a town's local economy, offering cheap and healthy food, encouraging local enterprise and acting as important cultural attractions.
> 
> ""I'm pleased to announce a package of advice and training for traders and managers today that will help reverse the recent decline that has started in many traditional retail markets.
> 
> ""This package taps into the knowledge and expertise of the best market traders and we believe it can support traders, old and new, so that they can continue to contribute to the rich variety of local life for many years to come.""

There are over 1,100 traditional retail markets and over 600 Farmers Markets operating in the UK today. Turnover is in excess of £3.5bn from 45,000 micro businesses supporting almost 100,000 jobs.

The good practice guide shows how markets can help to build the 'Big Society' - bringing people and communities together at economic and social hubs. The report gives examples markets strengthening the local economy and offering opportunities for aspiring entrepreneurs.

The 'Managing Markets' report examines different ways of managing markets, whether it's a local council, private or trader-run. The report helps local areas identify on the most effective management model for them.

The NMTF has developed the first national programme of business support and best practice guidelines specifically aimed at market traders, to deliver help where it is most needed. Working closely with traders and identifying their needs NMTF has devised a training package consisting of 15 modules and 15 guides for new and existing traders. This programme will be launched next month to traders and the wider markets community.

Joe Harrison, Chief Executive of NMTF said:

> ""The work that the Government and the markets industry have done to get to this stage has been groundbreaking. I believe that the three products launched by Markets Minister Andrew Stunell today will support existing and potential traders so that they can continue to contribute to the local economy and wider regeneration of an area.""

Graham Wilson Chief Executive of NABMA added:

> ""NABMA and colleagues in the Retail Markets Alliance are delighted that their work with Government has resulted in these important resources for the markets industry.""

The Minister held panel discussions at Liverpool City Council offices with a range of employees, including social workers, police community support officers, librarians, park managers, youth workers and benefits officers.

Mr Stunell asked for ideas on how their jobs could be made easier by cutting red tape and how they could break down barriers and reduce unnecessary hurdles in their day-to-day work.

He said:

> ""My Spending Challenge visits in Bristol and Liverpool have given me a chance to listen to people who are committed to delivering the best public services.
> 
> ""Our frontline workers are perfectly placed to advise us on making backroom savings to protect the frontline services that people rely on, so I challenged them to give me their ideas.
> 
> ""There were some common themes emerging from Liverpool and Bristol that I will take back to Whitehall. Hearing the problems and possible solutions is vital so we can understand what the barriers are so we can change legislation and make things easier.
> 
> ""Our coalition Government is committed to listening to what people want. Whether that's removing bureaucracy to get things done at a local level, giving more power to Councils, or getting better value for taxpayers' money.""

As part of the Spending Review set out in the Budget, the Government launched the 'Spending Challenge' aimed at engaging the country in thinking about public services and how they are provided. The [Spending Challenge website](http://spendingchallenge.hm-treasury.gov.uk/) (external link) is open for everyone to submit their money saving ideas.

Andrew Stunell MP has now visited four areas to hear ideas from frontline workers. He visited Bournemouth on 7 July, Woking on the 19 July, Liverpool on 23 July and Bristol on the 26 July 2010.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1765745,Minister maps out digital future of geography lessons,"A new mapping service to help make geography lessons more interactive and fun has been launched at a London school by Baroness Hanham and Ordnance Survey.

![Baroness Hanham and Vanessa Lawrence at the Digimap for Schools launch](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1767735.jpg)Baroness Hanham and Vanessa Lawrence at the Digimap launch

'Digimap for Schools' will give pupils across the country easy access to detailed digital mapping. The new service will include access to the best Ordnance Survey's mapping available for Great Britain. It has 450 million features including building outlines, pavement edges, walls and fences.

Ofsted have previously highlighted geography as being the worst taught lesson in the curriculum and complained that children found it boring. The Ordnance Survey believe digital maps can help bring the subject to life and assist teachers to nurture and foster learning about the environment and location in which we live.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""It's important for schoolchildren to learn how to tell where places in this country are. 'Digimap for Schools' will provide detailed geographical information for pupils. I'm very pleased to launch this scheme, which will give all children easy access to Ordnance Survey maps through the latest technology in interactive digital mapping.""

Baroness Hanham joined year seven geography pupils at Graveney School in Wandsworth to launch the new online service today with the Ordnance Survey Chief Executive Dr Vanessa Lawrence.

For the last nine years the Ordnance Survey has provided free maps to 11-year-olds to encourage interest in geography. Digimap will now lead this scheme into the future following feedback that pupils like to be able to create their own maps using computers. Digimap will means schools can access and print all the maps needed for teaching geography from primary through to A Level examinations.

Vanessa Lawrence CB, Director General and Chief Executive of Ordnance Survey said:

> ""I am delighted that we are able to offer such a wide range of Ordnance Survey data available to pupils of all ages and we are keen to encourage teachers to use mapping data to make geography relevant and interesting to pupils.
> 
> ""Our free maps for 11-year-olds has been incredibly successful with over six million OS Explorer Maps being sent out in the last nine years.  However, when we look at how young people engage with technology, it seems very appropriate to provide mapping digitally and in a relevant way that they will continue to use as they grow and develop into adulthood.""

'Digimap for Schools' is a collaborative venture between EDINA - a UK national academic centre based at the University of Edinburgh; JISC Collections for Schools - a not-for-profit initiative which enables schools across the UK to access a range of high quality online subscription resources at discounts of up to 80 per cent; and Ordnance Survey.

Further information on 'Digimap for Schools' is available on the Ordnance Survey website. In addition MapZone® is a totally free, bright and lively web site produced by Ordnance Survey that aims to teach children, between 7 and 16 years, mapping skills in a fun way (see links, top right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2044644,Minister pledges to abolish 'digital apartheid',"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today pledged to end a 'digital apartheid' that has meant many social tenants in England are unable to get online.

Sobering estimates suggest nearly half of council and housing association tenants in England, including some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, do not have access to the internet or have never gone online. People in online households can save more than £200 a year shopping online and are 25 per cent more likely to find work, while children with internet access achieve two grades higher than those without - so it's clear that many low income households are missing out.

Chairing the 'Digital by Default' summit today with UK Digital Champion Martha Lane Fox, the Minister said that internet access should be a necessity, not a luxury. He will also say that Government is committed to getting social housing connected so tenants can reap the benefits of digital living, from access to online shopping bargains and job-hunting; to moving home through 'HomeSwap Direct' to be closer to a new job, family, or to a property better suited to their needs; and more.

Ministers, landlords and social tenants' representatives at the housing summit discussed:

  * how to drive down the cost for social tenants to get online in their homes, including possibilities for a 'Digital Deal' along the lines of the Green Deal
  * ensuring that social tenants have the opportunity to use the internet and see the benefits firsthand
  * encouraging providers to consider internet access as a 'best practice' service and to ensure that new affordable rent homes are built broadband ready
  * whether broadband could become part of the standard affordable rent package; and
  * options for providing access to the right technology to get online.

The Minister also called on social housing providers to look hard at what more they could do themselves to get their tenants online. Social landlords can save up to £340 million in communications costs alone by providing their tenants with the means to report repairs or pay rent online.

Race Online's new Digital by Default casebook, which shows how innovative thinking and partnership working can improve the lives of both landlords and tenants, offers plenty of inspiration:

  * Sunderland City Council, which has some of the highest levels of deprivation in the UK, has helped get the local community online by establishing 'electronic village halls' across the city. Centres now exist in village halls, youth clubs, schools, health centres, libraries, pubs, and communal areas in tower blocks social housing estates. The programme has 200 community e-champions to provide face-to-face support and inspiration.
  * All 800 residents in two London Peabody estates have been given internet access in a three-year Wi-Fi pilot. At least half of the residents are now using the service - many through smartphones - and a laptop loan scheme is available for those who can't afford one.
  * The Hyde Group has joined forces with volunteers from Eco Computer Systems who refurbish and recycle computers for local people to buy at reduced cost. Almost 200 PCs and laptops have been sold with 200 more orders on the way, saving residents around £200,000.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""In a country where the majority of people can apply for a job or even just buy a loaf of bread at the click of a button, it's no longer acceptable that so many of the most vulnerable people in our society are deprived of something most of us now take for granted in our daily lives.
> 
> ""I'm calling on every social landlord to look long and hard at how they can help their tenants get online, from offering networks of public internet cafes to providing the technology to log on at home.
> 
> ""Internet connectivity is considered by many to be the fourth essential utility, and should be a necessity, not a luxury. Government is committed to helping demolish this unacceptable digital divide that is blocking social mobility for millions of council tenants.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1695250,Minister praises Dartford for binning fortnightly collections,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill praised Dartford Council for listening to the public on keeping weekly bin collections alive on a visit to the area today.

Mr Neill applauded the innovative public poll that showed 94.5 per cent of residents who took part wanted to keep weekly collections, and urged other councils to follow suit. Councils across the country have been moving to fortnightly collections over the past few years despite public support for weekly rounds.

Mr Neill today pledged that the Government will be legislating in November's Localism Bill to allow local residents to initiate local referendums.

The Government is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of all waste policy from product package to waste collection. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has already withdrawn Audit Commission guidance encouraging councils to switch to fortnightly collections and laid out plans to remove the bin tax laws from the statute books.

Mr Neill met refuse collectors on their collection round in Joydens Wood today and spoke to some of the residents who voted to keep weekly collections in the 'Big Bin Vote'.

Mr Neill said:

> ""The binman has never been so welcome as now with so many councils cutting weekly collections. Fortnightly collections cause problems with fly-tipping, odour and vermin as well as forcing people to drive to their local dump to get rid of their rubbish, increasing congestion and pollution from the traffic.
> 
> ""It's good to see here in Dartford the council listens to local people and keeps the weekly bin collections they value. It was fantastic to meet the refuse collectors who are doing such an important job as well and hear directly from residents.
> 
> ""I hope other Councils will follow Dartford's example in the difficult times ahead as we work together to cut the deficit and listen to local people about what services matter the most.""

The council received further praise for publicly ruling out the practice of 'bin snooping' - secretive bin searches to find out what the public are throwing away. Ministers believe the best way to encourage responsible waste disposal is to incentivise recycling rather than punish families with taxes, and reward them for going green.

Environment Ministers have axed the funding for 'pilot' schemes for the bin taxes. Under the bin tax laws, once a pilot scheme had been introduced, it could be rolled out across the country without a substantive vote in Parliament.

With council finances due to be tightened as the Government tackles reducing the deficit, Ministers are urging councils to increase their use of local referendums to find out what services people want to protect.

The coalition Government set out plans in its Programme for Government to encourage the use of local referendums on any local issue.

### Notes to editor

1. The Waste review will look at what policies are needed to reduce the amount of waste generated and to maximise reuse and recycling, while also considering how waste policies affect local communities, individual households and businesses.

2. The Waste review includes looking at how government can work with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish collections and make it easier to recycle, to tackle measures which encourage councils specifically to cut the scope of collections; and to address public concerns over the civil liberty aspects of inappropriate enforcement practices associated with household collections.

3. People can contribute to the review through the Defra website, by responding to the call for evidence or taking part in an interactive debate on waste policies. Information about the Review, including the Terms of Reference and call for evidence, can be found at: [www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/waste-review/index.htm](http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/waste-review/index.htm) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1664105,Minister sees Big Society in action in Southampton,"Communities Minister Baroness Hanham was in Southampton to hear from local trainees how an innovative partnership of voluntary and private sector organisations is helping the local community back into work.

The Wheatsheaf trust works to promote social inclusion by providing employment advice and programmes to support people in finding work and training. The centre helps around 1750 people a year gain valuable skills and training.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""The Wheatsheaf Trust is an excellent example of how the formation of local partnerships allows enterprise to steer priorities. I am pleased to see how the Trust supports those in the local community who are having difficulties with employment, by giving them the confidence and skills to look for and achieve a stable working future. This is a good example of the Big Society in action.""

The minister toured the centre, met staff and discovered how the trust addresses local employment and job training needs, through forming close working links with local employers.

Michael Oakley, 21, on Wheatsheaf's Future Jobs programme, talked to Baroness Hanham while attending the Finding and Getting a Job Course. He commented:

> ""I'm a qualified welder but there's no work around. I felt there was more opportunities for me if I trained. At the Wheatsheaf trust I enrolled on the construction skills workshop - part of it is a carpentry module. It has definitely helped me, I now know that carpentry is my future, and I will build on the basic carpentry skills I have already learnt here.""

Matthew Davis, 20, a trainee on Wheatsheaf's Future Jobs programme, was in the construction skills workshop when Baroness Hanham visited. He said:

> ""At the Wheatsheaf trust I have learnt basic construction industry skills brick-laying, carpentry and painting. This has built on my previous NVQ2 in carpentry and added to my skills. I am also more confident, as I have met more people. Through doing the course I have become more positive and plan to get a job in the construction industry so I can use my new skills.""

Elizabeth Fells, Head of Public Service Reform at the CBI, welcomed Baroness Hanham's visit, saying:

> ""The work done by A4e and the Wheatsheaf Trust is an excellent example of how the private and voluntary sector can work together to provide good quality services to the local community, on behalf of the local authority. Encouraging the development of more partnerships like this will be crucial to ensuring we can continue to provide the services people expect on a local level during this period of economic challenge.""

Jonathan Cheshire, Chief Executive, Wheatsheaf Trust added:

> ""We were very pleased to meet Baroness Hanham and show her our work. It was good to have the opportunity to show how the effectiveness of our work is amplified by productive partnerships with companies like A4E and public bodies like Southampton City Council.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1713456,Minister sets out his stall with package of help for markets,"A new package of practical advice and training for traditional market traders was announced by Coalition Markets Minister Andrew Stunell.

Speaking at the annual NABMA Conference in Buxton, the Minister said a well run market can be a hub of social activity, a centre of community enterprise, tourist asset and a focal meeting point for local people. Markets have a key role in helping to build stronger communities and the 'Big Society'.

Despite this, recent studies show that while speciality markets like farmer's markets thrive, some traditional retail markets are struggling with the growth of out-of-town supermarkets, the recession and internet shopping.

To help address this Mr Stunell announced a trio of measures, brought together by the Government and the industry, to support existing markets and help potential enterprising traders get started:

  * A practical advice guide for markets: highlighting their benefits, areas of good practice and pointing traders to more detailed information on specific concerns
  * A market management report: examining the pros and cons of various ways in which markets can be managed so councils and private operators can see which is the best model for them
  * Business support: 15 training modules and guides that will be launched by the National Market Traders Federation next month to support new and existing traders.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Markets have been the birthplace of towns and cities in this country and across the world. English markets founded over a 1000 years ago are still going strong. Today markets sit at the heart of a town's local economy, offering cheap and healthy food, encouraging local enterprise and acting as important cultural attractions.
> 
> ""I'm pleased to announce a package of advice and training for traders and managers today that will help reverse the recent decline that has started in many traditional retail markets.
> 
> ""This package taps into the knowledge and expertise of the best market traders and we believe it can support traders, old and new, so that they can continue to contribute to the rich variety of local life for many years to come.""

There are over 1,100 traditional retail markets and over 600 Farmers Markets operating in the UK today. Turnover is in excess of £3.5bn from 45,000 micro businesses supporting almost 100,000 jobs.

Joe Harrison, Chief Executive of NMTF said:

> ""The work that the Government and the markets industry have done to get to this stage has been groundbreaking. I believe that the three products launched by Markets Minister Andrew Stunell today will support existing and potential traders so that they can continue to contribute to the local economy and wider regeneration of an area.""

Graham Wilson Chief Executive of NABMA added:

> ""NABMA and colleagues in the Retail Markets Alliance are delighted that their work with Government has resulted in these important resources for the markets industry.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1912776,Minister supports shared ambition for growth across the Humber,"Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today met with local business and civic leaders to hear their proposal for a local enterprise partnership to drive growth and create upwards of 20,000 jobs across the Humber.

Mr Clark met with representatives from local business representatives, the four councils (Hull, East Riding, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincs) and local MPs at the Chamber of Commerce in Hull to hear their shared plans for exploiting the area's full economic potential. These plans focus on seizing the opportunities that exist around ports and logistics, chemicals, and renewable energy.

The Government has asked local business and local councils take charge of their local economy. Over 90 per cent of the country now has a local enterprise partnership. Humber is now set to join them with the full proposal expected to be formally submitted to the government shortly.

Mr Clark said:

> ""I've come to the Humber today to hear first hand how business leaders and local councils are taking the reins of the local economy and developing a Humber-wide approach to driving growth. They have come together with a common goal- to create an ambitious local enterprise partnership that will unlock growth and create jobs and prosperity across the whole of the Humber.
> 
> ""I'm impressed by the desire of all the partners to work together in the best interests of the Humber, regardless of party politics. And I'm grateful for the hard work and commitment of local business and council leaders, and local MPs, in getting everyone to this point.""

Business Minister Mark Prisk added:

> ""I want to encourage those final few areas without a local enterprise partnership to move quickly and come together so businesses and entrepreneurs in their area can start to benefit from the leadership and initiative that we want local enterprise partnerships to provide.
> 
> ""Already, 34 have been approved covering 94 per cent of businesses in England. They have begun working to break down the barriers to balanced, sustainable economic growth and jobs in their areas.
> 
> ""It's vitally important that all parts of the country work hard to address the challenges in their business communities and are able to apply for and benefit from the help we have put in place.""

The Humber local enterprise partnership proposal sets out a vision for Humber to become a national and international centre for renewable energy, capitalising on its natural assets, existing expertise and potential for development.

By working together through a focused, business-led partnership the partnership is aiming to create upwards of 20,000 jobs in this emerging sector in some of the most deprived parts of the country.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2052242,Minister urges public to be part of the solution to rough sleeping this Christmas,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has urged people across the country to help solve rough sleeping this Christmas by calling local hotlines if they see someone sleeping on the pavement in their neighbourhood.

The Minister for Housing slept rough himself in 2007 in order to highlight the plight of rough sleepers and recalling his night on the street he said:

> ""In a civilised society no one should have to sleep on the pavement.""

He acknowledged that factors like relationship breakdown can lead to sudden homelessness, but said that the Government is committed to its recently launched No Second Night Out policy.

Now the Minister has appealed to the public to help rough sleepers by calling one of the 24-hour hotlines to bring urgent assistance to rough sleepers.

For the first time, a complete list of these hotline numbers will be available on the Communities website, the Minister announced as he visited Emmaus in St Albans - a project where formerly homeless residents work to restore second-hand furniture and get their lives back on track.

He also announced his New Year's resolution - to establish a new national single phone number which will provide a central point of contact for people across the country to get help for rough sleepers in their neighbourhood.

Based on London's No Second Night Out number, introduced by the Mayor, this new phone line and website will ensure anyone wanting to get help for rough sleepers in their area will know where to go and who to call.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Christmas is a time for Goodwill, and with winter rapidly approaching, it's more important than ever to ensure that help and shelter are available for those who need it most.
> 
> ""We have some of the strongest homelessness protection in the world and councils have a responsibility to ensure that their residents aren't 'roofless' in their area, so I'm calling on members of the public to help them achieve this.
> 
> ""It is my New Year's resolution to ensure that a national 'No Second Night Out' hotline is in place by next Christmas, but there are already many local homelessness hotlines available, from Nottingham to Norwich. These numbers are now posted in one place on the Communities website. So my message is simple: if you see someone sleeping rough, please bring them the gift of shelter this Christmas.""

Local council leader Chris Roberts and Chief Executive Mary Ney showed Mr Neill around the affected town centre, where he listened to local experiences and witnessed the clean-up operation already in full swing. The Minister also met Greenwich councillor, Nigel Fletcher, to discuss the clean up operations.

In Woolwich the jewellers, banks and bookmakers were attacked and the local Wetherspoon's pub was left almost completely burned down, damaging what is normally a bustling town centre.

The Minister also met with local Fire and Rescue crews to thank the teams for their tireless work over the past few nights to ensure the safety of the local community and limit any fire damage to homes and businesses.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Residents of Woolwich should be in no doubt that we are doing everything necessary to restore order to Britain's streets and to make them safe for the law abiding citizens.
> 
> ""Our next priority is to help local communities rebuild their lives, get businesses up and running again and make sure nobody is left without a roof over their head.
> 
> ""Today we have made immediate financial support available to those that need it and we will continue to work closely with Greenwich Council who have already responded to situation. Even in the face of shameful criminal behaviour by rioters, local fire crews have carried out their duties bravely and professionally. We owe them all a debt of gratitude.
> 
> ""Finally I want to encourage every local resident to make an effort to shop locally in the coming weeks and show your support for the high street here.""

The package of one off support being announced includes:

  * A £10 million recovery fund to help councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe, clear and clean again, which can be used, for example, to clear debris left strewn in streets and make immediate repairs to pavements and roads. It will also support councils who want to office council tax discounts or relief to victims.

  * A £20 million High Street Support Scheme - will be made available immediately, for the streets and areas where businesses were affected by the rioting. The money will help get business trading again and meet short term costs like reducing business rates, finance building repairs and encouraging customers back to the area. In addition, seriously damaged homes and business properties will have their liability for council tax or business rates removed.

  * Re-housing funding to meet the immediate costs of emergency accommodation for families who have been made homeless by the disturbances. The Department will meet these costs under established homelessness funding processes.

This assertion has been taken out of context. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""The Minister's quote was taken out of context. The average reduction in spending power is 4.4 per cent. The Government has also ensured that the most vulnerable communities are protected and that there is a fair distribution between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire.

  * allocates a total government revenue grant of £72.7bn to local authorities in 2011-12
  * distributes £29.4bn in formula grant in 2011-12 and £27.1bn for 2012-13
  * keeps the average revenue spending power reduction for 2011-12 at only 4.4 per cent and reduces the upper limit from 8.9 per cent to 8.8 per cent
  * increases transitional grant to £96m in 2011-12 and £21 m in 2012-13
  * makes a further £10m available through formula grant to compensate shire districts for the loss of concessionary travel funding in 2011-12

It was also announced that the Government has endorsed the proposal for North East Lincolnshire to be a member of the Greater Lincolnshire local enterprise partnership. This means that North East Lincolnshire will be able to play a full role in both the Humber and Greater Lincolnshire partnerships.

The Government has moved quickly to recognise the Humber local enterprise partnership proposal, submitted last week, so that they can drive forward their economic ambitions.

Mr Clark visited local business and civic leaders last month at the Chamber of Commerce in Hull to hear about their plans for a pan-Humber partnership for growth. The Humber local enterprise partnership will focus on strategic opportunities for growth around ports and logistics, chemicals, international trade, strategic transport, infrastructure and innovation.

The final proposal outlines a vision for the Humber area to become a national and international centre for renewable energy and aims to create upwards of 20,000 jobs in this emerging sector.

There are now 35 local enterprise partnerships across the country covering over 96 per cent of England's population, 1.9 million businesses and 22 million employees. These partnerships bring local business and council leaders together to determine the economic priorities for their areas.

Mr Clark said:

> ""I'm delighted to announce that we are approving the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership today. This partnership has the ambition, ideas and business involvement to really exploit the potential for growth across the Humber area. 
> 
> ""I have taken a close interest in this local enterprise partnership and the potential it has to positively shape the future of the Humber local economy. Local business and civic leaders in the Humber area are now poised to realise major opportunities for economic development in renewable energy, ports, logistics and chemicals. They should now move swiftly to appoint their business led board and make their plans for a growth a reality.""

Mr Prisk added:

> 
> ""With the Regional Growth Fund and the Enterprise Zones both open for bids, now is the time for local enterprise partnerships to seize the opportunities to bring significant investment to their areas.

The Government announced in the Budget that 21 new enterprise zones will be created this year, with the first ones based in eleven vanguard local enterprise partnerships. Today the Government has invited applications for the remaining enterprise zones from established local enterprise partnerships, by the end of June 2011.

If the area is not part of a local enterprise partnership, it cannot apply. This is a crucial opportunity for the business community and local civic leaders to come together and put in place a partnership that will help Hull, the East Riding of Yorkshire and North and North East Lincolnshire realise its economic potential.

Following the Secretary of State Eric Pickles visit to Tottenham last week, Local Government Minister Bob Neill visited Woolwich and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell headed to Manchester and Salford.

Following the riots the Government acted quickly to make available a multi-million pound package of support to enable councils to act swiftly and confidently to restore communities and get support to local people and businesses.

### Woolwich

Mr Neill returned to Woolwich to see first hand how the community is using the support available to restore, rebuild and improve the town centre. He was first there in the immediate aftermath of the riots.![Bob Neill visits Woolwich after the riots](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2094721)

Calling into local businesses, Mr Neill talked to traders about the impact of the riots and how the community rallied round to help get them get back on their feet.

Local council leader Chris Roberts and Chief Executive Mary Ney accompanied the Minister. The council set up the Greenwich Backing Local Business fund and opened a special advice surgery for more than 60 businesses to drop in to get expert advice and support.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""The picture here in Woolwich is very different to the one I saw in the immediate aftermath of the riots. Despite the attempts of a few to wreak havoc, the community in Woolwich have pulled together to restore their town.
> 
> ""The progress well underway in Woolwich is symbolic of a community that is proud of their local area, their local businesses and determined to see their town thrive.""

### Manchester and Salford

Meeting local people, traders and council workers in Manchester and Salford, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell praised the energetic way communities came together in the aftermath of the riots and pointed to the true examples of community spirit in action.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Whilst the actions of a small minority determined on causing destruction caught our attention for a moment, it is the examples of true community spirit that will endure; the 'broom armies', the campaigns to support local businesses, the messages of pride in the area posted on shop fronts.
> 
> ""It's been great to meet the people that paint the real picture of community life in Manchester and Salford and see that recovery and progress is well underway.""

Mr. Stunell also met with council leaders in both areas to discuss the impact of the riots and the support improvement in the areas. An 'I love Salford' campaign was launched to build up the community spirit and invite people to show their support for their area by shopping locally and wearing campaign badges. In Manchester a campaign group called 'Eye on Manchester' rallied support from locals to help in the clean up.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1853571,Ministers take next steps towards fairer social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell have today taken the next steps towards the biggest reforms to social housing for a generation, moving power from Whitehall to town halls to help the millions of families left languishing on waiting lists.

Ministers have today set out proposals for how all social landlords will be required to show how their tenancy plans will provide for and protect the most vulnerable, including families with children. In these further details of reforms published today, Ministers also outlined the extra freedom from central control that councils will be given, so they can target help on the people in their communities who need it most.

Ministers also confirmed that all tenants will have access to a National Home Swap Scheme, making it easier for them to move should their situation change.

Despite £17billion spent on social housing over the past 13 years, the numbers of people on waiting lists has doubled to nearly five million. Ministers believe this is because the centrally-controlled system gives councils and housing associations little room to find innovative and creative solutions to their local housing problems.

Instead, the Localism Bill currently before Parliament will give landlords the option to offer flexible tenancies, and will give councils greater control over allocating their social homes, so this valuable resource is available to those who need it most, when they need it. Councils will continue to publish their policies on how social housing is allocated - showing how priority will continue to go to people in greatest need. All social landlords will be required to publish their policies on issuing different tenancies - including how they plan to meet their responsibility to make necessary provisions for the needs of the most vulnerable families.

Ministers have carefully considered the balance between central prescription of the lengths of tenancies available and local flexibility, and propose that a two-year minimum tenancy should still be available for landlords to offer - but in the vast majority of cases, they expect longer term tenancies to be offered - particularly for vulnerable households or those with children.

Existing tenants will not see their rights or rents affected by these far-reaching reforms. However, under ministers' plans, all tenants will benefit from national home swap services, giving tenants greater opportunities to move home if they want to - whether for work, to be closer to family or to a property better suited to their needs.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Over the past 13 years a lazy consensus in social housing meant the numbers of people left languishing on waiting lists almost doubled. We cannot sit idly by and watch as people simply join the back of the queue - urgent reform is needed to make sure as many people as possible benefit from the support that social housing offers.
> 
> ""This new system will be fairer and more flexible, ensuring the most vulnerable in our society continue to be protected, while giving councils the freedom to offer fixed tenancies to new tenants so they can give help where and when it's needed for as long as it's needed.
> 
> ""And while existing tenants will see no changes to their tenancy agreements, they will no longer be trapped in homes that no longer suit their situation, but will have much greater opportunities to move if they want to.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""It's clear that sticking to the status quo will not help the millions of families stuck on social housing waiting lists across the country, nor the hundreds of thousands of families forced to suffer homes that no longer meet their needs. Far-reaching reform is long overdue.
> 
> ""That's why today we can confirm how, through the Localism Bill, landlords will be given much more room for manoeuvre, to meet local housing demand - while at the same time making sure that the most vulnerable in society continue to be protected.
> 
> ""These changes will lead to a much smarter system, one led not from Whitehall but from the Town Halls by people who know the housing issues that their local communities face, and who will finally be able to make the changes they know are needed to tackle them.""

Today's announcement follows a consultation on social housing reforms launched in November. The Government received almost 700 responses from landlords, housing organisations, tenants and members of the public.

Around two thirds of the local authorities responding to the consultation welcomed plans to give them extra freedoms to manage their waiting lists, and two thirds of social landlords said they plan to use the new flexibility to offer fixed tenancies.

Key reforms include:

**Flexible tenure** - Landlords will be given the freedom to offer their properties under fixed term tenancies, from a minimum of two years, subject to consulting on a publishing a clear policy on how they will use their new flexibility on tenancies. The Government has today set out, in the light of consultation, more details about what landlord policies should contain, including protections for the vulnerable and existing tenants.

**Fairer allocations** - Under the Localism Bill, councils will have a new power to determine who qualifies to join their waiting list. Existing tenants looking to move house will no longer have to compete with those on the waiting list unless they have 'reasonable preference', giving councils and housing associations the flexibility to work with tenants who want, rather than need, to move.

**Greater mobility** - The Government plans to press ahead with a National Home Swap Scheme, making it easier for tenants who want to move to find someone in a similar position to exchange properties with. Landlords will be required to subscribe to Internet-based mutual exchange services, giving tenants access to as many properties as possible. In addition, Ministers plan to launch vanguard projects to trial innovative schemes to promote mobility still further: more details will be published later this year.

**Fairer provision for homeless people** - there will be greater flexibility for councils to make decisions on how best to help people at risk of homelessness at the local level. Currently some homeless families are turning down the decent private rented accommodation they've been offered as a settled home, and demanding to be provided with expensive temporary accommodation, at huge cost to the taxpayer, until a social home becomes available. Councils will be able to offer flexible solutions to people at risk of homelessness. Despite tight public finances, the Government will be investing £400million to prevent homelessness and rough sleeping.

**Affordable Rents** - a new 'Affordable Rent' tenancy will be offered by housing associations to some new tenants of social housing from April 2011. Affordable Rent properties will offer fixed term tenancies at a rent higher than social rent - with landlords able to set rents at up to 80 per cent of local market rents. This will enable landlords to raise funds to build more affordable housing for those who need it. The Government is investing £4.5billion in new affordable homes over the Spending Review period, which combined with the reform of social housing should deliver up to 150,000 new homes over the next four years.

**New tenants power of scrutiny** - Grant Shapps has announced plans for the abolition of the Tenant Services Authority, and instead to give England's eight million social housing tenants strengthened powers to ensure that their landlords provide quality housing and are held to account when problems arise. Landlords will be expected to support tenant panels - or equivalent bodies - in order to give tenants the opportunity to scrutinise the services being offered and to be involved in resolving disputes. These changes will be made as part of the forthcoming Localism Bill.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1643180,Ministers talk Big Society with faith leaders,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark, attended a meeting of religious leaders to discuss the ways in which faith communities can get involved in building the Big Society.

Hosted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the meeting at Lambeth Palace on Friday was an opportunity for the leaders of the main faiths to discuss with government ministers the role of faith groups in helping to strengthen communities.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""We see the Big Society as a very practical way to put people in control of the decisions that affect them and to encourage everyone to take an active part in civic life.
> 
> ""For years, faith communities have been quietly making a huge difference day-in and day-out, to every single neighbourhood in the country - something that has not been sufficiently recognised by central Government. Today has been an opportunity to do so and to explore how, in realising our ambitions for a Big Society, we can together build on the huge amount of experience faith groups have in getting out into the community.
> 
> ""Some see religion as a problem that needs to be solved. The new Government sees it as part of the solution. I want to send an important signal that we value the role of religion and faith in public life. The days of the state trying to suppress Christianity and other faiths are over.""

Dr Clark commented:

> ""Faith communities make a vital contribution to national life: guiding the moral outlook of many, inspiring great numbers of people to public service, providing support to those in need. A 'community of communities', they often have the experience, volunteers and connections that can put them at the heart of their neighbourhood.
> 
> ""Everyone has a part to play in building the Big Society. The Government's job is to make sure that religious groups and other grass roots organisations have the space in which to get on with their good work, unhindered by the barriers many of them currently negotiate.""

Today, the Prime Minister has fleshed out plans for developing the Big Society with the announcement of a Big Society Bank along with four areas - Liverpool, Sutton, Windsor and Maidenhead and the Eden Valley in Cumbria - who will lead the way in building the Big Society.

It comes as the Minister outlines the findings of his review of Communities and Local Government schemes providing support to homeowners at risk of repossession.

The Council for Mortgage Lenders has forecast that there will be 53,000 repossessions in 2010. With this in mind, Mr Shapps has decided to refocus the Mortgage Rescue Scheme so it benefits homeowners in need while providing value for money for taxpayers, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to Housing Associations and tighter caps on property price and repair costs.

Using their knowledge of the needs of their communities, councils will help to deliver the scheme alongside their local housing associations to ensure that the scheme is targeted at homeowners who are most likely to benefit from it. The longer term role for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme will be considered through the Spending Review.

### Homeowner Mortgage Support

Launched in April 2009, the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme has only helped 34 people although research to be published shortly shows that it has had a positive impact on lender forbearance practice and mortgage arrears management.

Because of low administrative costs, the Minister has decided that the Support Scheme will remain as a backstop that maybe needed if interest rates rise. It will close as planned at the end of the financial year.

Mr Shapps is also stepping up work with partner organisations, such as [Shelter](http://www.shelter.org.uk) and [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) (external links), to promote the help available to struggling homeowners.

But the Minister believes the most effective thing the Government is doing to help homeowners is tackling the record deficit and preventing the need for rapid increases in interest rates.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The most effective thing the Government can do for homeowners is to tackle the record deficit and avoid the need for rapid increases in interest rates. But there must still be effective help on hand for those struggling to pay their mortgages.
> 
> ""So today I can confirm that the Mortgage Rescue Scheme and Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme remain available as a last resort to homeowners facing the real threat of repossession.
> 
> ""But the most effective thing anyone with money worries can do is to not bury their heads in the sand, seek early advice and speak to their lender to avoid losing their home. I would urge people to visit [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link), or contact organisations like Citizens Advice for free advice on taking control of their finances.""

Independent money saving expert Martin Lewis said:

> ""Mortgage repossession's a catastrophic threat for struggling families, and anything that's done to help them ride it out is crucial. The most important rule is get help as soon as possible - fighting repossession when they're coming for your house is too late, instead act as soon as you spot the potential for trouble and possible arrears.
> 
> ""The help at hand means some who qualify will have their mortgage interest paid for them, others will be allowed to postpone paying both through official government scheme and improved lender leniency and a few may have their house part bought.
> 
> ""So the golden rule is if you're in trouble speak to your lender asap and a non profit agency like [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) or [National Debtline](http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/) for help plus visit Money Saving Expert and DirectGov and you may find its easier to start sleeping at night.""

### Help and advice for struggling homeowners

Anyone with mortgage worries can go to [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) where they can get impartial advice, find out the steps they can take to keep their home and prepare an action plan to tackle their own finances. Free debt advice is also available from organisations including [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/), [Shelter](http://www.shelter.org.uk) and [National Debtline](http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/) (external links).

The Financial Services Authority has also recently introduced tough new rules on lenders so repossession remains the last resort, and so those in arrears who have come to an agreement on repayment are treated fairly.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1975514,More communities chosen to try out new planning powers,"New powers to give local people unprecedented influence to determine the future of their areas are to be tried out in 36 more front-runner areas, Planning Minister Greg Clark announced today.

These areas are among the first to test out neighbourhood planning, a radical new power being introduced in the Localism Bill, which will give local people a real voice in deciding how development will look in their area.

For the first time, neighbourhood planning will allow communities to shape their own vision for their community, from deciding the locations of shops, offices and schools to setting standards of design for new housing and protecting green spaces of value to the community.

In areas where local people want to see homes and businesses built, neighbourhood planning will allow communities to grant a blanket planning permission for development to go ahead without developers having to make separate applications.

The community has the final say on whether a neighbourhood plan comes into force. If more than 50 per cent of people voting in a local referendum support the plan, then the local planning authority must bring it into force.

Neighbourhood planning is designed to return power to local people and local businesses on planning decisions in contrast to the top-down regional strategies being scrapped by the Government.

Planning Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""For too long local people have been shut out of the planning process with no real voice to affect decisions about the places where they live. Unpopular regional strategies left people without the ability to influence the future of their community and this fuelled resentment towards growth. Neighbourhood planning will hand power back to communities to decide the vision for their area as they see fit, encouraging people to plan positively for their future. This is localism in action and the enthusiasm across the country for neighbourhood planning shows how keen communities are to get involved.""

The 36 areas announced today are the next wave of 'front-runners' to test out neighbourhood planning, bringing the total to 126 across the country. Each front runner's local council is being given £20,000 to support work on neighbourhood planning and free advice from planning experts will be available for the local community. Examples of work to get underway include:

  * In Thame, South Oxfordshire, the town council is focusing their plan on the local need for more affordable housing and transport infrastructure, as well as developing open spaces and protecting the area's cultural heritage.

  * In Northumberland, two rural parishes are concentrating on the need for more affordable housing, a new high school and an education campus.

  * At the industrial estate at Trafford Park, the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce is working with Trafford Council on a Business Neighbourhood Plan to develop a state of the art, sustainable mixed use environment for high growth.

  * In Sherston, Wiltshire, the Parish Council is aiming to deliver new homes, especially affordable homes for elderly and disabled residents. Their plan will also look at the need for key local infrastructure such as high speed broadband and new schools, as well as opportunities to develop a community orchard.

  * At Uppingham in Rutland, local business and the community are working together on a neighbourhood plan for the town centre that will promote economic growth and social wellbeing.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1616206,More councils must be savvy shoppers,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is calling on councils to make every pound go further in the face of the nation's £156bn deficit.

Ministers want to see councils working together to use their collective buying power and innovative technology like e-auctions to get better deals from their suppliers.

Joint buying across the board could help get better value for taxpayers money and avoid the huge differences in prices charged to different authorities for the same product.

The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) found that only twelve per cent of local government used approved collaborative deals, way below the recommended level of fifty per cent.

### ""Supermarket sized budget and a cornershop mentality""

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""Some councils have a supermarket sized budget but a cornershop mentality. This has got to change. Local authorities need to look at where every penny is going and what that money is delivering.
> 
> ""Shining a light on spending will help to put savings before cuts. Whilst councils have already delivered significant efficiencies there is still more excess waste to cut back.
> 
> ""A renewed and concerted focus on better procurement, greater transparency and shared services that puts the emphasis on productivity above processes will end duplication, wasteful spending and wasteful working.""

Next week the Local Government Association will host an 'enhancing productivity' meeting chaired by Eric Pickles and Baroness Eaton to help councils improve value for money, procurement practices and collaboration in an effort to protect services.

> ""This has got to change. Local authorities need to look at where every penny is going and what that money is delivering.""

The Secretary of State has also written to councils to tell them they must do their business openly and transparently and called on them to publish details of all spending over £500 in full and online.

Greater transparency will root out wild overspending, expensive mistakes and waste and could be the key to saving the public purse millions of pounds.

For example the Audit Commission has abandoned plans to appoint a new Chief Executive after Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said the proposed remuneration deal on offer was against the spirit of public sector austerity and that it would send a signal to councils across the country.

### Facts and Figures

  * Local Government spends £42 billion a year on outside contracts including everything from construction, IT, telecoms and catering
  * That is more than the national GDP of ninety countries including Luxembourg, Jordan and Albania
  * Councils own and maintain a lot of assets. There are 470,000 civic buildings; over 50,000 vehicles including more than 6,000 bin lorries; 1.27million computers.
  * The National Audit Office found that in some cases there are huge differences in the prices parts of the public sector, including councils, are paying for goods and services
  * The cost of toner cartridges can vary between authorities by up to 745 per cent
  * The cost of envelopes varied between £2.04 and £9.13, and paper costs varied across councils from £6.84 to £14.79.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1901708,More councils wanted to lead growth front-runners project,"More pioneering local authorities are being asked to come forward to demonstrate how the benefits of development can be shared directly with their communities and neighbourhoods, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Last November, Mr Clark announced the Government's plans to reform the Community Infrastructure Levy - which has the potential to raise an estimated additional £1 billion a year of funding by 2016 to support growth locally - and invited local authorities to apply to become part of the Front Runners' project to develop the best approach to implementing the Levy in their area.

The first phase of the project is now underway and in response to the high demand from councils, local authorities are now being offered places to take part in a second phase.

Each front-runner will have access to a tailored package of support from the Planning Advisory Service to help them set a charge for their area, which is likely to include group workshops, good practice advice, and lessons learned from the first local authorities to implement the Levy.

Reforming the Community Infrastructure Levy is part of the Government's commitment to radically reform the planning system and gives local authorities more choice and flexibility in how they fund infrastructure that they, their local communities and neighbourhoods want.

The levy will have a positive economic effect upon development in a local area, unlocking land for growth and providing developers with much more certainty 'up front' about how much money they will be expected to contribute, which in turn will encourage greater confidence and higher levels of inward investment.

Greg Clark said:

> ""More and more local authorities are showing enthusiasm for introducing a reformed Community Infrastructure Levy, to help ensure the rewards of growth are felt at a neighbourhood level.
> 
> ""We are now looking for a further group of pioneering authorities that are not only committed to introducing the levy in their local area, but are also keen to demonstrate how the levy will act as an incentive to support growth and development.""

### Notes to editors

1. To ensure all those who have an interest in the levy and who might be involved in its operation fully understand its key features, its rationale, purpose and how it will work in practice, two new information documents about the levy will shortly be released - one on collection and enforcement and another on reliefs and exemptions - alongside a revised version of the Department[s Community Infrastructure Levy overview. The overview document is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/communityinfrastructurelevymay11](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/communityinfrastructurelevymay11).

The Community Infrastructure Levy Information Documents on Reliefs and Exemption and Collection and Enforcement will be released shortly.

2. On 18 November 2010 Greg Clark announced the Government's plans to reform the Community Infrastructure Levy. The Community Infrastructure Levy was first introduced by the previous Government in April 2010. It allows local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from developers undertaking new building projects in their area. The money can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development.

3. All local planning authorities that had previously applied to become a Community Infrastructure Levy Front Runner will be automatically submitted for consideration for Phase 2 of the project, but local authorities are strongly encouraged to submit an updated application that fits the amended selection criteria.

4. The Planning Advisory Service provides consultancy and peer support, learning events and online resources to help local authorities understand and respond to planning reform.

5. Further information about the application process can be found on the Department's website here: [www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/communityinfrastructurelevy/cilfrontrunners/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/communityinfrastructurelevy/cilfrontrunners/).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1681360,More local homes means more rewards,"Local communities that build more local homes will be rewarded by getting more funding to use in their local area on things they consider to be a priority. Communities will be able to use their reward for going for growth on whatever they wish locally, such as council tax discounts for residents or facilities like playgrounds.

The New Homes Bonus, to be introduced early in the Spending Review period, will mean more homes built where they are needed and is intended to reverse the decline in the number of homes being built, currently languishing at its lowest peacetime level for 80 years.

The Minister confirmed that councils who take action now to give planning consent and support the construction of new homes where they are needed and wanted will receive direct and substantial benefit for their actions.

Mr Shapps urged councils to open up an honest and direct debate with the communities they serve about the benefits of building new homes in their area - how they can reap the benefits of development and not just the costs.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We will not tell communities how or where they should grow. But the new Homes Bonus will ensure that those communities that go for growth reap the benefits of development, not just the costs.
> 
> ""With housebuilding at its lowest peacetime levels for over 80 years action is needed now to build the homes the country needs. That's why these new powerful incentives to build will be introduced early in the Spending Review period. And it's why I have confirmed that those councils who go for growth now will reap the rewards. So I urge councils to seize the moment and open up a debate with their communities now about the new homes they need and how they would use the new Bonus.""

The Government wants to hear the views of councils, communities and industry as it finalises the scheme. A consultation paper on the final scheme will be published following the spending review.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1919000,More support for voluntary and community groups campaigning to save local assets,"Planning Minister Greg Clark today outlined more support for voluntary and community groups campaigning to save much-loved local assets such as historic pubs, seaside piers or precious market halls, under threat when their owners refuse to sell.

A compulsory purchase order by a council and future development as a community asset can often be the ideal solution. But community groups with viable, fully financed schemes can feel shut out of the process, left without a voice in shaping local plans, as councils do not have to engage with them or acknowledge their contribution. In revised guidance issued today, Greg Clark calls on local authorities to take seriously all viable requests from voluntary and community groups put to them for the compulsory purchase of a threatened community asset.

The Right to Buy, being introduced through the Department for Communities and Local Government's Localism Bill, will give people a foot in the door when assets come up for sale. But some groups can't wait that long and are living in communities blighted by abandoned buildings and derelict sites spoiling the look, feel and safety of their area. Communities often have good ideas for making better use of these buildings or assets but are thwarted by negligent owners interested only in rising land prices. The revised guidance could help them to take action quickly.

If communities want to bring a valued local asset back to use - for example turning a boarded up building into a community centre - they can contact their council and ask them to use a compulsory purchase order to buy the asset. Mr Clark is urging councils to give greater attention to applications from voluntary and community groups who know their area and often have innovative ideas to make the best of local assets. That doesn't mean special treatment or an automatic green light but it might mean that communities know that their hard work and enthusiasm will not simply be met by a blank face or stuck at the bottom of a never ending in-tray.

Under the new guidance, local authorities would also have to respond formally, outlining the reasons behind their decisions. This will shine the light of transparency on council decisions about assets in their local area.

The revised guidance builds on the proposed new 'social responsibility' deal for councils, announced by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, which asks them to give them greater support to voluntary and community groups and treat them with the full respect they deserve.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Communities often feel powerless when they see local assets going to waste.
> 
> ""Voluntary and community groups who know their area best should have more of a say in determining how their neighbourhoods develop and local authorities - acting in the best interests of local people - should take seriously all viable requests put to them for the compulsory purchase of a threatened community asset.
> 
> ""Community groups would of course have to pay a fair price for the asset, as well as the costs incurred by the local authority. But they should be given the opportunity to save their village shop, the last remaining pub or bring dilapidated buildings back to life to help preserve the character and social fabric of their neighbourhood.""

The new guidance to local authorities builds on the Government's determination to hand power back to local people.

The Localism Bill will give bold new powers to local people to protect and improve their community assets and will enshrine in law the opportunity for community and voluntary groups to have a greater say over what happens in their local area including the running of local services.

### Notes to editors

1. Local authorities have wide powers to acquire land by compulsory purchase, for instance to secure the proper planning of their area and grant public access to land for recreation.

2. Current guidance to local authorities in England is contained in an Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Circular 06/2004 Compulsory Purchase and the Crichel Down Rules. A new Appendix to the Circular relating specifically to requests from voluntary and community organisations, and other third parties is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/circularcompulsorypurchase2](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/circularcompulsorypurchase2).

3. The guidance will remind authorities that, as with any compulsory purchase, they must be able to finance the cost of the scheme (including the compensation to the owner) and the Compulsory Purchase Order process either from their own resources, or with a partial or full contribution from the requesting organisation.

4. In order to assess whether there is a compelling case in the public interest for a compulsory purchase order, councils will have to ensure (as they must for all orders) that there is a viable scheme for the asset and that there are no other impediments to the scheme going forward. Local authorities should ask those making the request for such information that is necessary for them to do so.

5. This could include:

  * the value of the asset to the community

  * the perceived threat to the asset

  * the future use of the asset and who would manage it (including a business plan where appropriate)

  * any planning issues; and

  * how the acquisition would be financed.

6. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced a new fair deal for voluntary and community groups, to the National Council of Voluntary Organisations on April 13 2011. Further details on the Communities Secretary's speech can be seen at: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1855041](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1855041).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1730482,More than 60 councils open books to armchair auditors,"Local authorities that don't put their spending detail online are denying the public the right to hold their council to account, Secretary of State for Local Government Eric Pickles said today.

All councils and Fire and Rescue Authorities are expected to publish details of all spending over £500 in full online by January. With just 64 working days till the start of the New Year the clock is ticking for councils to open their files so the public can see where their money is being spent.

As part of meeting the transparency target Mr Pickles has welcomed new guidance from the Local Government Association detailing best practice for putting council spending and senior salary information online. They stress the importance of ensuring that the data is clear, comprehensible, machine readable, licensed to encourage reuse and so local people know it's available.

Mr Pickles' own department continues to lead the way. This week it published all its spending data online for 2008-09 and for the first quarter of 2010-11.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""I've called for a new era of transparency where all councils publish their spending over £500 online. I commend those councils that have been brave enough to face public scrutiny so far. There are now only sixty or so working days for those lagging behind to catch up.
> 
> ""This isn't another central government box-ticking exercise. The public have a right to see how their council tax is being spent so they know they are getting value for money and the best possible frontline services.
> 
> ""I want to see an army of 'Armchair Auditors' pore over the information and hold their council to account if things are not done right. That means the data also has to be easily accessible: today advice has been published that will help councils yet to comply. There are hundreds of computer whizzes who'll find creative new ways to make that raw data relevant to local life.""

Central Government resources to assist citizens wanting to access national and local data for free re-use include the website [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/home) (external link). The CLG datasets published this week are available on this [website](http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/transparencyingovernment/). Other websites like [OpenlyLocal](http://openlylocal.com/) (external link) are also making it easier to access data and to interrogate or compare the published information.

Some councils have also found innovative ways of using their spending data. For example, Redbridge Council has created a truly innovative budgeting tool called 'You Choose' which lets the public try to balance the council's budget themselves. This gives them a say on where every public penny goes in their area. It has been so successful that the Local Government Association has decided to sponsor it and make it available to all councils.

Professor Nigel Shadbolt of Southampton University, a member of the Public Sector Transparency Board said:

> ""The publication of all spends by Local Authorities over £500 is hugely important. Authorities spend millions and millions of pounds in our name, so why shouldn't we know how that money is spent?
> 
> ""It will be useful in a whole range of ways. We are going to be able to see what the pattern of spend is, what particular contractors are used and whether it represents value for money.  Once it's published councils can have a discourse with the citizen to find out how they want their money to be spent and where they would want to save. This is another important step in the drive for open data and transparency at all levels and across all of Government.""

Chris Taggart, creator of openlylocal.com added:

> ""This is about a conversation with the people. Publishing information - which belongs to the public after all - allows them to look at local spending and say: wait a minute you could be saving money there.
> 
> ""There are all sorts of benefits to be gained from understanding the data and using the skills of the community to understand it. Councils themselves can benchmark their data and spending against other councils. People can build applications which will allow everyone to ask questions and join the conversation.""

### Notes to editors

1. You can find out which councils have already published their spending data over £500 online at: [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/transparency/localgovernmentexpenditure/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1730482) ; a map and timeline of these councils can be found at: [www.dipity.com/CommunitiesUK](http://www.dipity.com/CommunitiesUK) (external link).

2. Getting data out in the open is just the first step for Government. The real potential for open government lies with greater transparency by unlocking innovation and analysis and scrutiny. Individuals and community groups can us the data understand the decisions councils take every day or to create new business opportunities who find solutions and ideas using the information in new ways. Here Communities Secretary Eric Pickles talk more about council transparency at: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOwG7gGp_Y4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOwG7gGp_Y4) (external link).

3. In line with the transparency agenda requirements on spend transparency for central government departments, councils should be publishing their own spend by January 2011. Today the LGA has published new advice about how councils should publish their spending details. It has taken the original advice of the Local Public Data Panel and sought to provide additional practical guidance. It sets out what should be included; how to make the information available under open license in machine readable format; and how to approach redactions and personal data. The guidance is currently aimed at councils, police authorities and fire and rescue authorities - but there is no reason why other public bodies such a parish councils and waste authorities should not also follow the guidance. Full details can be found at: [http://lgtransparency.readandcomment.com](http://lgtransparency.readandcomment.com) (external link).

4. In line with the transparency agenda requirements on the pay of senior public servants, councils should have their salary information published by 31 January 2011 providing a snapshot from 31st October 2010. Data to be published for each individual includes; Organisation Name, Body (organisational identifier), Individual's Name (subject to consent), Job title, Service Area, Full-Time Equivalent, FTE Pay band for disclosure - this will be shown in £5,000 bands (for instance, £80,000 £84,999). Councils are also asked to publish data on the scale of their authority in terms of; employment, expenditure and service responsibilities. The guidance, Transparency - publication of senior salary information Reporting Guidance, is intended to assist local authorities in the preparation and publication of senior salary information. Full details can be found at: [www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=21407431](http://www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=21407431) (external link).

5. Openly Local is a place to access data about the workings of your Local Council, without having to poke around through dense, difficult-to-navigate websites. It can be found at: [http://openlylocal.com/councils/spending](http://openlylocal.com/councils/spending) (external link).

6. Redbridge Council's new 'You Choose' public engagement tool shows residents how the council currently spends their money and asks them to feed back and suggest how they can make savings. Redbridge council successfully trialled the tool last year and it has now been expanded to other councils across the country with the help of YouGov and the Local Government Association. Redbridge's YouChoose tool can be found at: [http://youchoose.yougov.com/redbridge](http://youchoose.yougov.com/redbridge) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1768228,National Citizen Service pilots announced,"National Citizen Service will become a reality next year, providing young people with new experiences and skills to improve their confidence and help them make a difference in their communities.

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, has announced the locations and providers of the first National Citizen Service pilots, to take place in summer 2011.

The scheme, part funded by the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG), aims to help young people with the transition to adulthood and encourage them to get involved in improving their local area. In addition to a two-week residential component, participants will work together to develop social action projects in their own neighbourhoods.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Today's young people possess a huge amount of talent and energy but too often can feel disconnected from wider society. For many, National Citizen Service will be the first opportunity they have to leave their everyday surroundings, get out of their comfort zone and engage with people from different backgrounds.
> 
> ""The activities will equip participants with essential skills and allow them to develop as individuals. Not only that, but the whole of society be changed for the better by more confident, empowered and engaged young people.
> 
> ""This scheme is crucial for strengthening the foundations of the Big Society and I am fully committed to supporting it.""

Young people will be directly involved in the forward momentum of the programme, as feedback from participants in next year's pilots will inform the future development of the scheme and the nationwide roll-out.

Several of the chosen providers' proposals included strong partnership working with councils and other partners. The Government hopes that many other local authorities will be inspired to consider hosting a pilot in their area.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2137365,National taskforce to end the problem of 'beds in sheds',"A new national taskforce has been set up to tackle the issue of ""beds in sheds"" by taking action against criminal landlords and removing illegal immigrants.

Today Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Immigration Minister Damian Green held the first in a series of cross-Whitehall summits with representatives from the police, the UK Border Agency and local government.

The meetings will find ways to close down thousands of sheds and outbuildings being rented out illegally to migrants, including some with no right to be in the UK.

These 'tenants' are being exploited by ruthless landlords who charge them extortionate rents to live in cramped conditions.

These modern day shanty towns, often visible on websites such as Google Earth, can be plagued with rats and cockroaches - and are potential death traps with dodgy wiring and poor sanitation.

Some foreign 'tenants' wish to return home but, after destroying their passports to avoid removal, find it difficult to do so quickly.

Today, Mr Shapps and Mr Green discussed:

  * encouraging councils to make greater use of legal powers across planning, fire safety, housing and environmental health
  * how to better measure the extent and nature of the problem, drawing on information collected by Whitehall and Town Halls
  * how best to ensure councils and the police share the intelligence available and enforcement activity
  * closer working with organisations such as the Indian High Commission to help those wanting to return home; and
  * steps to prevent more ""beds in sheds"" from being created.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It is a scandal that these back garden slums exist to exploit people, many of whom are prepared to return voluntarily to their home country but instead find themselves trapped into paying extortionate rents to live in these cramped conditions.
> 
> ""I want to see a crackdown on these criminal landlords. So today we are launching a national taskforce, made up of the police, local councils, the UK Border Agency and HM Revenue and Customs to close down these 'beds in sheds', help those living there to be reunited with their families and ensure their so-called landlords feel the full force of the law.""

Immigration Minister Damian Green said:

> ""Those with no right to be in the UK must leave the country. If they volunteer to leave, we will help. If they refuse, we will enforce their removal.
> 
> ""The UK Border Agency will do whatever is necessary, working with local authorities and the police, to clear up this problem and enforce our laws against those who are in the UK illegally and the employers who exploit them.
> 
> ""This work is well under way - many individuals have already been removed from the UK and further enforcement visits will follow.""

### Notes to editors

1. Some councils have argued that they need to have a new legal power of entry into premises without notice. However, councils already have this ability provided they obtain a magistrates' warrant - which provides a proportionate check and balance on the use of such powers.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2034246,New Build Indemnity scheme,"The Prime Minister has today (21 November 2011) announced that the Government will provide a guarantee for up to 100,000 new mortgages at up to 95 per cent loan to value for new build properties in England. The scheme will be led by the Home Builders Federation and Council of Mortgage Lenders.

The new build indemnity scheme will deliver both a significant increase in housing supply, and access to affordable mortgages for those without large savings who wish to purchase a new home.

The scheme will be open to all builders and all lenders operating in England who wish to participate. The scheme will apply to all new build properties, both houses and flats, and will be available to all potential buyers, subject to appropriate underwriting criteria. Mortgages will be available under the scheme from March 2012.

The Government can confirm today that the following major lenders have agreed in principle to participate in the scheme: Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS, Santander and Yorkshire and Clydesdale Banks.

These lenders make up over 80 per cent of mortgage lending in the UK.

The Government can also confirm that over 25 home-builders have agreed in principle to participate in the scheme, including the three largest Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey (full list at end).

These house builders provide over 60 per cent of new homes in the UK.   

The Government hopes that other lenders and builders will also want to participate in the scheme.

### Detail

Borrowers will now have access to mortgages of up to 95 per cent loan to value at affordable rates on new build homes from participating builders.

The scheme will be available to all potential buyers, except buy-to-let investors or second home owners.

The process for agreeing these mortgages will be the same as for any other mortgage. From the borrower's perspective, this is a 'normal' mortgage, with no equity loans or second charges.

For each new build property sold under the scheme, the home builder will contribute 3.5 per cent into an indemnity fund, with the Government supporting the fund to a total of 9 per cent of the property value.

The indemnity fund pays out to the lender if a property financed under the scheme is repossessed and there is a shortfall. Builders will take the first loss in the indemnity, with Government only being called upon to pay once the builder's fund has been exhausted.

Lenders and builders will retain the right to decide which builders and lenders they wish to engage with, according to their own commercial judgements.

The Government will establish a delivery group of lenders, builders and Government to meet on a regular basis to monitor the practical implementation of the scheme.

There will be a cap on the value of properties eligible for inclusion in the scheme.

The scheme will be delivered by the Department for Communities and Local Government and will be available in England only.

The Government will conduct an evaluation of the scheme after two years, to ensure that there has been an appropriate and positive effect on the demand and supply of new build properties.

  * Crest Nicholson PLC
  * McCarthy and Stone Retirement Lifestyles Ltd

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1978640,New factsheets give tenants and landlords the lowdown on their rights and responsibilities,"In a move designed to strengthen tenants' and landlords' awareness of their rights and responsibilities, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today published helpful advice aimed at those letting or renting a property.

Mr Shapps said that too often, unnecessary disputes between those renting and letting a property were caused by misunderstandings that could be prevented by having access to better information on the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.

So today, he has published three easy-to-understand factsheets offering helpful advice on different aspects of letting and renting out a home. These are:

  * [Dos and Don'ts factsheet for landlords](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/tipslandlordsassuredshorthold)   
giving advice on securing a suitable letting agent, the need for written agreements and inventory's, and protecting tenant's deposits
  * [Dos and Don'ts factsheet for tenants](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/tipstenantsassuredshorthold)   
giving top tips to on the legal requirements of renting, how to deal with disputes and what to expect from your landlord
  * [Gaining possession factsheet](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/factsheetgainingpossession)   
to help landlords decide which route to follow when they need to take back their property, how much notice they must give the tenant and guidance on the procedures which can be used to help speed up the process.

The vast majority of England's private tenants report they are satisfied with the service they receive from their landlords, but councils have a wide range of powers at their disposal to tackle the minority of rogue landlords that blight some communities. These include:

  * powers to require landlords to take action to rectify hazards in their property
  * where landlords resist, the ability to make and charge for improvements and to prohibit use of the affected parts of the property; and
  * discretionary licensing powers to tackle areas blighted by poorly managed privately rented stock.

Mr Shapps also announced his backing for a new industry-led campaign launched this month, aimed at addressing a key area of concern tenants and landlords alike have in dealing with letting agents - making sure their money is safe. Many of those involved in the private rented sector often worry about what protection is available if an agent were to go out of business or, in extreme cases, abscond with their rent and deposits.

![SAFEagent kitemark](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1978586.jpg)SAFEagent, set up and managed by the National Approved Letting Scheme (NALS), have introduced a new kitemark that will allow landlords and tenants to identify agents who are members of a Client Money Protection insurance scheme, and to vote with their feet when looking to let or rent a property.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The private rented sector provides a valuable source of accommodation for over three million people in England, and the vast majority of them are happy with the service they receive. That's why I have promised not to wrap the sector in red tape, but to instead work with the industry to help them develop their own plans to tackle those bad landlords, and with councils to throw the book at those who don't live up to their responsibilities.
> 
> ""Tenants have a right to expect good quality safe accommodation when they rent a property, and equally landlords are right to expect that the property is looked after, that problems are reported to them quickly and that rent is paid on time. These factsheets are the starting point for those looking to rent or let a property, or for those landlords and tenants looking to resolve any misunderstandings that may arise. I would encourage all those in the private rented sector to read through them carefully and understand their own rights and responsibilities.""

### Background

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1636966,New government makes housing design a top priority,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has called on the country's architects to ensure their great designs deliver more benefits for the local community.

Speaking at the Housing Design Awards, Mr Shapps said design would be even more important in the new era of community-driven development.

### Good design priceless

The expert audience of architects, house builders and planners were told that although great design is inexpensive compared to overall project budgets, it is priceless for the benefits it brings to communities.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""My first visit as Minister for Housing was to launch one of today's winners - Kevin McCloud's new Triangle development in Swindon. This was no coincidence - I wanted to send a strong signal that in these straightened times, grand design is more important than ever.
> 
> ""Today in our towns and cities we see communities living out the broken dreams of your predecessors. Places built with the very best of intentions but resulting in the very worst for residents.
> 
> ""But lessons have been learnt and I know designers across the country share my enthusiasm for change. Together, we will give people the power to make their own decisions for the places where they live.
> 
> ""Rather than being told what will be built and where, residents of villages, towns and cities will be given powerful financial incentives to develop their own vision for the community. And they will demand great design that meets their needs - something I know you will deliver.""

### Community involvement

Mr Shapps praised the overall winner for making respect for the community a key feature of the design.

The blueprint for the 400-home Icon development in Street, Somerset evolved through community workshops.

Mr Shapps said he was particularly impressed at the involvement of local people in the design of the new development, which he highlighted as a model for the way the new Government sees good design and community involvement working in the future.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2051437,New green building hub puts Britain centre stage of transition to low-carbon future,"A new national construction centre will provide thousands of young people with the building skills they need to refurbish the nation's homes so they become greener and cheaper to run, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

Mr Stunell said the new Centre of Refurbishment Excellence, which he opened today in Stoke-on-Trent, would provide the nation's first green building skills hub, helping to create thousands of new jobs and preparing Britain for a low carbon future.

Located in the heart of the country on the site of a Victorian pottery works, the £11 million centre will provide a national focal point for the construction industry and related trades, serving as a training facility and showroom for the latest green building solutions.

The unique education centre will host courses and tutorials for 300 students and 2,000 tradesmen, teaching the latest innovative techniques for the green refurbishment of homes, and preparing the country for the Green Deal that is due to launch in autumn 2012.

Under the Green Deal homeowners and tenants will be able sign up specialist providers to upgrade properties so they become more energy efficient. No money will be paid upfront - instead people will be able to pay for the improvements over time, with the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the savings on energy bills.

The Green Deal represents a major opportunity for business - by 2015 up to 100,000 workers could be employed in the effort to upgrade Britain's homes, and the new centre in Stoke will play a major role in the training of students and tradesmen in the methods and materials they need to become Green Deal providers.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Over three-quarters of the buildings that will be standing in 2050 have already been built - so it is vital that we find ways to reduce carbon emissions from all types of existing buildings, and for every type of budget, or the country risks losing its battle against climate change.
> 
> ""That's why this Government has wasted no time taking practical steps to pave the way for tenants and homeowners to retrofit their homes through Green Deal, and for businesses to provide the upgrades.
> 
> ""But with the clock ticking towards the launch of the Green Deal, it is now essential that businesses have all the necessary skills to carry out green upgrades on existing homes.
> 
> ""So I'm delighted to be opening the new national centre for green building expertise - the new skills hub will become an international centre of excellence for providing the right skills to retrofit homes, helping to create jobs and putting Britain centre stage of the multi-billion pound transition to a low-carbon future.""

The new centre will become a catalyst for the regeneration of the Longton area of the city, and help provide much-needed training and employment to local young people and tradesmen.

Their new skills will help them refurbish the UK housing stock to the highest modern standards - in areas such as photovoltaic solar panels, ground source heat pumps, and new insulation techniques - and help Britain compete in the global low carbon market that is projected to be worth £4 trillion a year by 2015.

Government funding helped develop the new centre, which will now run as a partnership between Building Research Establishment, Stoke-on-Trent City Council and Stoke-on-Trent College. A second phase will see the redevelopment of the Grade II listed Enson Pottery Works into an additional exhibition and training facility.

Pioneer projects that are similar to the Green Deal have already started - in the largest scheme of its kind in Manchester, the Social Homes Ecofit scheme will provide improvements such as solid wall insulation and better heating systems for up to 9,000 social homes to make them more energy efficient, at no upfront cost.

The upgrades could save tenants up to £500 per year on energy bills, and at the same time create more than 1,800 jobs and bring a £100 million boost to businesses in Manchester carrying out the home improvements. Mr Stunell called for other social landlords to follow their lead, to improve the lives of their tenants and at the same time bring a much needed economic boost to local economies.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1753497,New incentives for councils to support local firms and create new jobs,"New proposals unveiled today could give Councils a renewed incentive to grow their local economies and attract new businesses to their areas.

Ministers have set out radical new proposals to look at ways for Local Authorities to keep the business rates they collect locally, thereby reducing central redistribution. However, the Government is clear any change must be to encourage growth and not lead to an increased tax burden on business.

The announcement was made as part of a White Paper on Local Growth published today that seeks to rebalance the economy and drive sustainable growth.

Under the current system over £20bn of business rates collected by councils are pooled by central government and redistributed across all local authorities. The result is that councils have a vital role supporting the local economy but the cash return for doing so is limited.

The plans to localise the business rates would introduce genuine incentives for local economic growth. By giving councils the ability to retain the money they raise in business rates, councils will have a more direct stake in the future of their own economies and access to funding to deliver the services their communities need.

Importantly, businesses should not be subject to locally imposed increases in the burdens of taxation that they do not support. Businesses that contribute financially to their local area can remain confident that the reforms will not lead to an increase in the tax burdens they face, without their support.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""We want every community to be open for business and every community to share in the benefits of economic growth. We intend to radically change the way local business taxes are allocated.
> 
> ""By scaling back central government's control and redistribution of this local business tax it will give them a genuine financial stake in their economy so local policy makers actively encourage growth and new businesses in their area.
> 
> ""The changes will introduce new incentives for councils to support local firms and create new jobs. It is what councils have been calling for, what government means when it talks about putting communities in control and what is required to grow our local economies.""

The Government also remains committed to providing more freedom to local authorities by introducing new borrowing powers against their business rate revenues to carry out Tax Increment Financing. Councils can use that borrowing to fund key infrastructure and other capital projects which will further support local driven economic development and growth.

Following consultation on the White Paper these proposals will be considered as part of the Local Government Resource Review in January 2011. Before proposals can be taken forward the Review will need to consider:

  * how to fund councils where locally raised funding would be insufficient to meet budget requirements and control council tax levels, as well as councils who do not collect business rates, such as upper tier authorities
  * the position of councils whose business rate yield would be significantly higher than current spending
  * how to ensure that proposals retain a genuine incentive effect and reward for promoting growth.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1813469,New incentives to tackle the blight of empty homes,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has set out how local people can bring back into use empty homes that attract anti-social behaviour and cause misery for neighbours.

The Government is offering powerful new incentives for councils to get empty homes lived in again, matching the council tax raised for every empty property brought back into use - which can be spent as they wish. Mr Stunell urged local communities to work with their council to identify where empty homes are blighting the neighbourhood, and start benefiting from extra cash that can be used to improve the local area.

There are around 300,000 long term empty properties across England. They can easily fall into disrepair, attracting squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour, bringing down the neighbourhood. So Mr Stunell is calling on residents to come forward and point out these properties to their local council so action can be taken to tackle the problem.

Under plans recently consulted on, the Government will match through the New Homes Bonus any council tax raised from a property that previously stood empty. The extra funding can be spent to benefit the local community - whether on council tax discounts, boosting local services, renovating more empty properties or improving local facilities.

The funding is part of a two pronged attack to get to grips with the issue of empty homes, and will supplement the £100 million already announced as part of the Spending Review for Housing Associations to bring empty properties back into use.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Long-term empty properties easily fall into disrepair, and attract the squatters, vandalism and anti-social behaviour that bring down our local neighbourhoods. With as many as 300,000 long-term empty properties across the UK this precious resource is being squandered.
> 
> ""Empty properties should instead be treated as an asset and brought back into use for those families that need somewhere to live.
> 
> ""That's why we're giving local councils powerful new incentives to tackle the problem. The Coalition government is pledging to match the council tax raised for every property brought back into use to help these properties become homes for thousands of families in need.
> 
> ""It's vital that local communities, councils and owners of empty properties work together to bring properties back into use and begin to tackle this problem that is blighting our local communities.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1924587,New 'Inspiring Communities' guide launched to help people get involved in community activities,"Today sees the launch of a new handy tips and advice guide designed to help encourage people of all ages and backgrounds to get further involved in local life and bring lasting improvements to their communities.

From kickstarting local projects, organising community festivals and engaging local businesses, the Inspiring Communities guide offers practical tips for anyone interested in running similar projects. It draws upon real life examples highlighting the experiences and the important and creative contributions made by communities across the country.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Whatever your age, everyone should be given the opportunity to feel part of their community and get involved in local projects. The examples highlighted are just a flavour of what can be achieved when people of all ages and backgrounds work together, bringing their own unique perspectives and ideas.
> 
> ""We know that real change is driven by those who know their local area best. That's why we are shifting the emphasis back to local neighbourhoods and giving power back to the people to take in the lead in their own communities.
> 
> ""I hope these examples and pointers are a useful source of inspiration for the many people across Britain raring to get more involved in their community.""

One of the examples in the guide is the 'Meet up Cafe' in Thetford, Norfolk. Set up in 2009 the cafe provides a hub for the local community, providing training opportunities and activities to help get the young people of Thetford more involved in the local area.

Sharon Matthews, of the Benjamin Foundation, who help run the Community Cafe said;

> ""We are always looking for new ways to inspire and empower our services users and the young residents of our county. Using both the Customer Insight material, and the Inspiring Communities guide we have been able to ensure that a new service launch, the Meet Up Cafe in Thetford, has made the best use of the strengths of the local community which it serves.
> 
> ""In little more than 18 months the Meet Up Cafe has worked with over 400 children and their families, held many learning events for adults and young people, ran intergenerational projects, and has encouraged many young people to try new things and visit new places.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1708636,New local enterprise partnerships criss-cross the country,"The commitment and ambition shown by councils and business to radically reshape the way business and government interact at the local level was praised by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Business Secretary Vince Cable today.

Following the closing day for submitting local enterprise partnership proposals the Government confirmed that it has received 56 proposals from across the country.

Ministers have been impressed by many of the proposals which are radical in their approach. They identify the variety of challenges facing individual local economies and put forward innovative ways of tackling them - reflecting the importance of allowing local areas to determine their own economic development and drive private sector job growth.

The Government is keen to see partnerships remain proactive and maintain momentum. Over the coming weeks Ministers will consider the proposals in detail, looking at how they will support economic growth, before providing feedback to partnerships ahead of the publication of the White Paper on sub-national economic growth and the introduction of the Localism Bill.

Tackling the debt crisis and rebalancing the economy are urgent national priorities.

Local enterprise partnerships can rewrite the economic geography of the country - unconstrained by arbitrary boundaries of Regional Development Agencies and the top-down prescription approach taken previously. Proposals include partnerships that cut across existing regional boundaries and include universities or community groups among them.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""These 56 local enterprise partnership proposals are just the beginning of a new radical way of delivering prosperity and rebalancing the economy.
> 
> ""We are facing economic problems that need solutions from local communities. The secret to the success of local enterprise partnerships will be working on the basis of local economic geography - gone are the artificial political regions of RDAs - this will better serve the needs of local business.
> 
> ""The bureaucracy of Regional Development Agencies gave local authorities little reason to engage creatively with economic issues. Local enterprise partnerships are a way of tying council and business interests together, and creating the conditions for business to thrive and prosper.""

Vince Cable said:

> ""Business leadership in local enterprise partnerships is critical. Mark Prisk and I have met many leading groups including the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the British Chambers of Commerce who have all contributed their thoughts to how it should work. It is clear that there must be genuine partnership between business and local government and that local enterprise partnerships should be practical bodies for promoting enterprise, not talking shops.
> 
> ""Trade and investment promotion, sector leadership, innovation, business support and access to finance will in future be led nationally, though with devolved local management in many cases. This still leaves huge scope for local initiatives to promote enterprise. The outcome will vary just as local economic priorities differ across the country. In some areas, there might be a focus on skills. In others, local enterprise partnerships may help set priorities for planning and infrastructure decisions. The key is that these partnerships are built from the bottom-up and will have the flexibility to determine their own agenda, rather than have it handed down to them by Whitehall.""

Yesterday was also the closing date for the consultation on the Regional Growth Fund. Announced in the Budget, the £1bn fund will provide support for projects that offer significant potential for sustainable economic growth and can create new private sector jobs. The two-year fund will particularly help areas that have been traditionally reliant on the public sector make the transition to private sector growth and prosperity. Proposals for funding will be sought from private organisations and public-private partnerships, and local enterprise partnerships will have a key role to play in coordinating bids across areas and communities.

Around 350 responses to the consultation were received, from organisations including trade associations, business groups, local authorities, universities and, environmental bodies, setting out their views on how the Fund can be designed to best meet the needs of local areas and communities. The Government's response to those views and further criteria for funding proposals will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2115515,New Mayors Cabinet to provide cities with a voice in government,"A new Mayors Cabinet that will ensure elected city mayors have a voice at the heart of Government was announced today by Prime Minister David Cameron and Cities Minister Greg Clark.

The Cabinet will provide city mayors with a direct route to the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers and provide a forum for cities to exchange ideas, highlight new innovations and lobby for the interests of their city.

Cabinet meetings will be held at least twice a year and will provide a valuable opportunity for cities to discuss key local issues with decision makers in Whitehall and for mayors to strengthen relationships with each other.

The Government believes that elected mayors can provide cities with the strong, visible and accountable leadership that will help them prosper nationally and internationally and deliver the homes and jobs this country needs.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

> ""Inspirational city leaders can do great things for their communities which is why I truly believe having a directly elected mayor in every major city in the country will bring about real change for the benefit of local people. And on 3 May 2012 we will be asking 10 cities to vote on having their own Mayor.
> 
> ""To ensure elected Mayors have a voice right at the heart of Government, I am pleased to announce I will establish a new City Mayors Cabinet so these locally elected leaders can meet regularly with me and raise the views of local people, tackle concerns, share ideas and highlight innovation. I very much look forward to meeting all the new mayors and to our first meeting.""

Cities Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""A Mayors Cabinet is a real opportunity for an elected mayor to represent their communities at the heart of Government and will ensure their city's voice is heard right at the top.
> 
> ""Mayors are a very good way of providing the strong, visible leadership that helps attract investment and have enormous potential to drive a city's future prosperity.
> 
> ""By coming together, sharing innovations and building relationships, city mayors will play an important role in ensuring their city lives up to its full potential.""

The Government is committed to the creation of directly elected mayors in the 12 largest cities outside of London.

On the 3 May 2012 ballot boxes will open in Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, Nottingham, Sheffield and Wakefied for local people to decide whether to have directly elected mayors.

Leicester has already elected a mayor and Liverpool, following a resolution of the City Council, will hold an election for a mayor on 3 May 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1786564,New national 'address book' to be free to emergency services,"A single 'address book' for England and Wales is to be created and made free to the emergency services for the first time, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

For years business and essential services have had to pay for the two different national address lists maintained by councils and Ordnance Survey creating a costly and inefficient system.

An agreement has been reached to set up a joint venture between Ordnance Survey and the Local Government Group to create a new single source of address data.

The new National Address Gazetteer will be free to all public services including the emergency services that rely on it to get to people in distress quickly. Essential services currently need both sets of address lists to ensure they have a comprehensive list of addresses available. It is also vital for managing benefits, arranging school buses, refuse collection routes and registering to vote.

Businesses will benefit from now only having to get one license for the addresses instead of two. This information is vital for many private sector businesses, such as utility companies or insurance firms who use address data to respond to incidents and help them fix problems quicker.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""It's crazy we don't have one single address list in this country. It makes no sense that both the public sector and businesses have to bear the unnecessary expense of licensing two sets of data, especially in these straiten times.
> 
> ""In particular, it is vital that the emergency services can get to people as quickly as possible. Having only one 'address book' will make that job easier, deliver vital savings that can be put towards frontline services and bring real benefits for business.""

Having just one database will cut out the time and money needed to produce and maintain two separate registers and bring savings that can be used for frontline services. This will provide:

  * greater efficiency by removing duplication and inefficient processes, such as the time needed to match addresses and work between two different databases

  * better delivery by being a simpler, easier product for both the public sector and businesses

  * greater transparency and make all addressing information free at the point of use for the entire public sector including those organisations working on behalf of the public sector.

Baroness Margaret Eaton, chairman of the Local Government Association, said:

> ""We are delighted to be working with Ordnance Survey to bring together, for the first time, this important information. This landmark agreement will allow councils and other public sector organisations to build a better, more accurate picture of where people live to help them deliver the services people need in a way that they want.""

Sir Rob Margetts CBE, Ordnance Survey non-executive chair, commented:

> ""I am enthusiastic about the creation of a single national address gazetteer and very confident that it will bring new benefits to all users of address information. Much hard work has gone into creating this joint venture which will supply a definitive source of accurate spatial address data to both the private and public sectors. I would like to thank everyone involved for getting the project this stage.
> 
> ""Over the last nine months Ordnance Survey has achieved some major milestones with the launch of OS OpenData in April, the Public Sector Mapping Agreement in August and now the announcement of a single national address gazetteer database. The demand for accurate, accessible, high quality geographic information has never been so high and the products which will be created from the new national address gazetteer database will be another step in meeting the needs of all of our customers.""

### Notes to editors

1. Local Government Group and Ordnance Survey are working together to create a single national address gazetteer database to combine the best of local government's address data (the National Land and Property Gazetteer) with Ordnance Survey's flagship address product (OS MasterMap Address Layer 2).

2. Access to addresses in the Gazetteer will be free at the point of use for the entire public sector including organisations delivering services on behalf of the public sector, as part of the Public Sector Mapping Agreement.

3. The joint venture will be responsible for the production and maintenance of the National Address Gazetteer database.

4. It is anticipated the database will be developed by April 2011. This will allow the market to review the database before it is released.

5. The proposal for the National Address Gazetteer will be referred to the Office of Fair Trading for third parties to comment.

6. Local Government in Scotland and the Scottish Government are supportive of creating a national address gazetteer and are working with Local Government and Ordnance Survey on ways to achieve this.

7. ONS are working with the Local Government Group and Ordnance Survey to share their knowledge gained from preparing the 2011 Census.

8. The national address gazetteer is welcomed by Royal Mail. Their 28 million addresses and 1.8 million postcodes in the Postcode Address File (PAF) will form a key component of the national address gazetteer database.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1658244,New people power to end the era of soaring Council Tax,"The public will be given the power to veto excessive council tax rises, Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles, announced today.

Council tax bills across England have doubled since 1997, pushing the average bill to £120 a month on a Band D home. The police authority levy imposed on council tax has trebled since 1997.

The new Government has already committed to help councils to freeze council tax. In parallel, steps are now being taken to help prevent bills skyrocketing down the line by giving local people the final say in a vote on excessive increases. This will replace top-down council tax capping by Whitehall, which gave no choice to local residents.

Under the new proposals laid out in a technical consultation today, any council that set its council tax increase above a set ceiling, approved in a democratic and transparent manner by Parliament each year, would trigger an automatic referendum of all registered electors in their area.

Residents would be asked to choose between the proposed rise and a 'shadow budget', which the council must also prepare within the defined limit. A no vote would leave councils having to refund taxpayers or give a credit at the end of the tax year.

The previous Government stepped in to take capping action against 36 authorities which set excessive rises. Some of the highest rises were South Cambridgeshire who tried to set a 100 per cent increase in 2005-06 and Lincolnshire Police Authority a 79 per cent increase in 2008-09.

The Secretary of State is determined to reverse the presumption that Whitehall knows best by making local councils directly accountable to the local taxpayer. Today's proposals would mean councils have to defend their budget decisions and bill increases to the local electorate instead of Whitehall.

Eric Pickles said:

### Notes to editors

1. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. By contrast, council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax in this period has risen 109 per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, every type of home has seen their bill double. The average police precept on council tax in England has trebled from £54 on Band D in 1997-98 to £161 in 2010-11. Average council tax and percentage change 1993-94 to 2010-11: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1518299.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1518299.xls).

2. The new proposals will ensure that councils know where they stand, as they will know in advance what the threshold is that will trigger a referendum. Under the capping regime, they were not told of capping limits until after they set their council tax increases. This threshold will be approved democratically and transparently by Parliament. Council tax referendums will replace the old regime of Whitehall capping. Ministers have written to the Welsh Assembly Government offering to extend the powers to the Welsh Assembly to offer similar protections and rights for council tax payers in Wales.

3. The technical consultation includes measures to tackle _de minimis_ increases, for example by parish councils, options to avoid expensive re-billing, and the mechanism by which a referendum would take place. Primary legislation is required to change the law. The right of veto is expected to be in place for council tax bills issued in March 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1634950,New plan locks-in radical decentralisation course,"A new action plan for the radical shift of power from Whitehall to local councils and communities that will make the Big Society part of every day life was published by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

Today the Prime Minister is announcing new Structural Reform Plans for making departments accountable for the implementation of the reforms set out in the Coalition agreement. They replace the old, top-down systems of targets and central mismanagement.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said in a speech today that the new 18 month programme will deliver radical decentralising and transparency reforms that put citizens and councils in control of their communities.

Mr Clark believes too much power has been sucked out of communities into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy.

Already Ministers have begun to remove swathes of centralising and red tape policies including ending Regional Strategies and putting housing back into local hands, ending unwanted garden grabbing, abolishing Home Information Packs and a burdensome council inspection regime.

The new 45 point action plan will force the department to shift gear so its purpose will be putting localism into action instead of ruling by central diktats.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""We're busting open the established way of doing things. The department will now only work to empower people, not to keep Whitehall in power.
> 
> ""Councils are no longer going to be strangled by prescribed one-size-fits diktats on the one hand and smothered by regional bureaucracy on the other.
> 
> ""We won't be micromanaging, second guessing, and interfering in your affairs any more. We're going to put citizens and communities in control.""

The Communities and Local Government's Structural Reform Plan will set out the department's five priority actions for making localism and the Big Society part of everyday life by:

  * decentralising power as far as possible
  * meeting people's housing aspirations
  * putting communities in charge of planning
  * increasing accountability
  * letting people see how their money is being spent.

### Notes to editors

1. The Cabinet Office has published Structural Reform Plans for Education and Communities and Local Government alongside the Cabinet Office Structural Reform Plan which was published recently. More information on the Structural Reform Plans can be found at [www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/07/structural-reform-plans-53023](http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/07/structural-reform-plans-53023) (external link).

2. The CLG Structural Reform Plan is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/structuralreformplan](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/structuralreformplan).

It sets out a range of actions and milestones envisaged to deliver Coalition Agreements including:

  * Stopping the restructuring of councils in Norfolk, Suffolk and Devon
  * Moving from Local Authorities reporting to central Government to Local Authorities reporting to local people
  * Giving residents the power to instigate local referendums on any local issue and to veto excessive council tax increases, as part of a Localism Bill
  * Freezing Council Tax in England for at least one year and seek to freeze it for a further year, in partnership with local authorities
  * Giving residents the power to instigate local referendums on any local issue and to veto excessive council tax increases, as part of a Localism Bill
  * Scrap Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), and replacing them with local enterprise partnerships
  * Scrapping Regional Strategies and return decision-making powers to local councils

3. The coalition has already begun row back on swathes of unnecessary red tape:

  * Called time on the Regional Spatial Strategy putting power back in the hands of local people and scrapped housing targets. Soon I will be announcing the full list of incentives to local authorities that will encourage development.
  * Made HIPS history and already the number of homes being put up for sale has gone up by 35 per cent. 
  * Put an end to unwanted 'garden grabbing' putting the decision back in the hands of local people.
  * Cut the ring fencing and red tape which comes attached to hundreds of millions pounds worth of central government grants.
  * Abolished Comprehensive Area Assessments where town halls report back to Whitehall.
  * Handed over more power to councils so they can manage high concentrations of shared housing in their area, without putting off landlords from renting the homes people need. 
  * Vince Cable has announced an immediate review of all regulation in the pipeline for implementation which has been inherited from the last Government.
  * Lord Young of Graffham has been appointed as advisor to the prime minister on health and safety law and practice to reduce the compensation culture.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2099384,New planning powers continue to be a hit with communities,"More than 100 communities eager to trial new rights that give local people powers to bring jobs and homes to their area and shape development were announced today by Communities Minister Bob Neill.

The areas are some of the first preparing to use new neighbourhood planning powers introduced in the Localism Act. Neighbourhood planning is an innovative part of the Government's localism agenda and ensures people for the first time have a major say in shaping development in their area.

Communities can help determine where development should go and can decide the type and design of development that can be granted automatic planning permission, through a Neighbourhood Development Order.

Today's bumper group of 108 communities join 125 other 'frontrunner' communities that have recently been working up plans and testing out the principles of neighbourhood planning before the system formally commences later this year.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""There has been enormous interest in neighbourhood planning and the large number of communities jumping at the chance to trial these new powers demonstrates the enthusiasm people have for this local approach to planning.
> 
> ""For the first time communities will be in the driving seat and allowed to shape the way they want their area to develop instead of having a vision imposed upon them from above.
> 
> ""Neighbourhood planning encourages people to plan positively for their future and is a real opportunity to deliver the homes and jobs communities need to thrive.""

Bob Neill will today meet Sir Bob Russell, MP for Colchester and community leaders from one of the successful fifth wave frontrunner applicants.

Myland Community Council, near Colchester in Essex, will develop a neighbourhood plan to manage future development proposed for the area. The core strategy for the area identifies North Colchester as a significant area of growth, with Myland (sometimes called 'Mile End') expected to accommodate 5000 new homes and new business premises.

The Minister will explain how neighbourhood planning works and hear how the local community wants to use their neighbourhood plan to identify sites and to produce detailed design briefs for new housing, employment and leisure facilities as well as looking at other important matters such as transport and travel.

The local councils of the successful front runners have been given £20,000 per project to support their work to help their communities with neighbourhood planning.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2046502,New powers for public to stop Council Tax rises this year,"A new 'local tax lock' that allows people a vote to stop council tax going up if their local authority refuses to freeze bills and hike the tax by more than 3.5 per cent was hailed by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today as a radical extension of direct democracy.

Council tax has more than doubled since 1997 and despite the huge public finance pressures the Government has taken unprecedented steps to fund £675m for a second year bill freeze.

If councils agree to the freeze local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could once again save up to £72 in council tax.

Councils that do not take up the freeze and instead seek to increase council tax above the 3.5 per cent level, proposed by Government today, will trigger a referendum. If the local electorate vote against that increase the local authority will have to revert to a council tax level that is compliant.  
  
The Localism Act abolishes Whitehall capping in England and puts local referendums in its place. Parliament will be asked to endorse the final vote threshold before councils set their annual budgets in the spring.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Since 1997 people have seen their council tax more than double, pushing typical bills to £120 a month. We are getting to grips with this with another council tax freeze deal and by radically extending direct democracy over big bill increases with a new local tax lock.
> 
> ""Councils have a moral obligation to help hard-working families and pensioners with the cost of living. If they want to hike taxes on their local residents above 3.5 per cent they'll now need to get a direct democratic mandate to do it.""

The Government also set out today its provisional second year funding settlement for English local authorities as announced a year ago. Councils will have an average spending power of £2,186 per household at their disposal.

£27.8 billion will be distributed in 2012-13 in a fair and sustainable way across all parts of the country - rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. It will give more weight to areas with the highest levels of assessed need. For example, the average spending power per household in Hackney will be £3,050 compared with £1,537 in Windsor and Maidenhead reflecting the fairness of the settlement.

Overall the average spending power reduction for councils in 2012-13 is expected to be limited to just 3.3 per cent or £75 per household, less than last year's comparable figure of 4.5 per cent.

The 2010 Spending Review set out the Government's plans to tackle the deficit and return the public finances, including local government, to a sustainable footing. Councils accounts for a quarter of all public expenditure.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles added:

> ""Every corner of the public sector has to help pay off the deficit including local government, which accounts for a quarter of all public spending.
> 
> ""The second year of our fair and sustainable settlement will mean councils still have on average £2,186 for every household they serve, enough to safeguard the most vulnerable, protect taxpayers' interests and the front-line services they rely on.
> 
> ""New financial incentives and powers for councils will mean they are well placed to find the necessary savings without salami slicing services - they have already started to show what can be done to increase efficiency, reduce overheads, shop smarter and fight fraud.""

In the coming year councils will have access to new financial measures including over £430m of match funding under the New Homes Bonus, up to £1 billion in Community Infrastructure Levy, a General Power of Competence and in future years the potential to increase revenue from business rate retention.

Councils will also benefit from the £2.4 billion Regional Growth Fund, the £500m Growing Places Fund and the Housing Strategy investment in social housing.

### Notes to editor

1. The Coalition Agreement committed the Government to relinquishing control over excessive council tax increases and giving that democratic power directly to local communities. This was legislated for through the Localism Act. Government has today published the council tax level principles it is proposing for 2012-13. No equivalent principles are being proposed for town and parish councils for 2012-13, although they may in future years. Council tax increases would trigger a referendum, if they exceed:

  * 3.5 per cent for most principal authorities
  * 3.75 per cent for the City of London
  * 4 per cent for the Greater London Authority, police authorities, and single purpose fire and rescue authorities.

2. The final principles for 2012-13 will be set out in a Report for the approval of the House of Commons early next year, at the same time as the final report on the Local Government Finance Settlement.

3. The Government's £675m council tax freeze offer for 2012-13 means that if councils take up the offer available local taxpayers in England living in an average Band D home could again save up to £72 on top of this year's equivalent saving compared to a five per cent rise in council tax. This builds on the current freeze offer, taken up by all eligible councils, boosting funding over four years to £3.3 billion. In order to meet our 2010 Spending Review Control Totals and to adhere to the Local Government Finance Act 1988 the second year of the grant for councils that froze or reduced council tax in 2011-12 is now within the 2012-13 settlement. Details of the council tax freeze offer are here: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2028954](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2028954).

4. Spending power data by Local Authority for 2012-13 can be found here: [www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1213/spendpwr.xls](http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1213/spendpwr.xls) (external link). The 'per household' figures are calculated using total spending power and the number of dwellings by Council Tax Band for each administrative area in England. The counts are calculated from data for England extracted from the Valuation Office Agency's database on 12 September 2011.

5. Total Formula Grant for 2012-13 will be £27.8 billion, of which an estimated £23.1 billion of business rates will be redistributed, Revenue Support Grant £477 million and Police Grant, £4.2 billion. Ministers have taken a progressive and fair approach to calculating how the grants will be allocated with more money going to those areas of the country that have the highest levels of dependency on grant. A plain English guide to cut through Whitehall jargon and the sheer complexity of the current system is available here: [www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1213/simpguid.pdf](http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1213/simpguid.pdf) (external link).

6. The Government has:

  * Focused resources in a way that insulates those areas of the country most dependant on central government funding by creating four separate grant bands to group councils into the settlement mitigates the effects of year to year changes, based on the extent to which different councils are reliant on government funding. These bands or 'floors' set the limit for their reductions and thereby protect councils against the sharper grant reductions they would otherwise have faced. This is a fairer and more progressive system than in the past.
  * Provided a transitional grant of £20 million for 2012-13, on top of £96m last
  * Devolved more power and financial control to local areas to manage reductions in line with the priorities of their residents, protect key frontline services, protect the local taxpayer, reduce burdens and drive efficiencies.

7. Technical data for the 2012-13 Local Government Finance Settlement can be found here: [www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1213/grant.htm](http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1213/grant.htm) (external link).

8. There will now be a short period of statutory consultation on the settlement which runs to 16 January. Ministers will then finalise their proposals and the settlement for 2012-13 will be debated in Parliament in early February in time for councils to set their budgets for next year.

9. The Chancellor announced in the Autumn Statement that the early education entitlement for two year olds will be expanded to cover around 260,000 children by 2014. In recognition of the increased costs of this expansion, additional funding will be included in the Early Intervention Grant in 2012-13. Extra funding amounts to £73m nationally, in addition to the £223m that was previously announced.

10. In addition to the Police Core Settlement was published by the Home Office today and revenue funding in 2012-13 have remained unchanged. The Olympic safety and security budget has been prioritised for 2012-13. The precept, which police authorities will set for 2012-13, will not be affected by the election of Police and Crime Commissioners in November 2012.

11. Average Band D council tax and percentage change between 1993-94 and 2011-12 are shown below:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1897172,New powers for the green fingered to protect allotments,"New community powers giving people rights to shape development in their neighbourhood could provide a bumper crop of allotments, Planning Minister Greg Clark announced today.

There is a growing interest from the green fingered wanting to grow their own fruit and vegetables but sites are becoming increasingly scarce. Research commissioned but unpublished by the previous Government that has been put online today reveals that in the period 1996 to 2006 the number of allotment plots fell by 50,630.

This legacy of decline has made it increasingly difficult for people to live the good life. Today 59 people are waiting for every 100 plots in contrast to 1996 when there was an average of 4 people waiting for every 100 plots.  

The Government is committed to turning this situation around and ensuring that allotments remain available to communities for years to come.

New neighbourhood planning powers currently being trailed across the country provide communities with a means to boost the number of sites with powers to protect existing allotments and identify new plots. In addition requirements for councils to provide allotments will be safeguarded as part of a wider review into reducing statutory burdens on local authorities.

The new right for communities to create a neighbourhood plan is being introduced in the Localism Bill. It will allow local people to set out the exact locations of sites that can be used for new allotments and those sites they want protected in the future. Once a neighbourhood plan had been independently assessed and passed by the community in a local referendum, a council will be obliged to adopt the plan.

Mr Clark said:

> ""More and more people want to grow their own vegetables but sites are becoming unnecessarily difficult to come by.  We need to stop this decline in allotments especially as people are so eager to enjoy the fruits of their labour.
> 
> ""People who get behind Neighbourhood Planning and develop a plan have real powers to not only protect existing sites but create more plots for the whole community to enjoy.""

Donna McDaid, National Secretary of the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners said:

> ""It is great news that people can now help ensure allotments remain available to communities for years to come.  We are always being told to be environmentally friendly and to reduce our carbon footprint wherever we can and allotments can go a long way in helping us achieve that. 
> 
> ""There is growing interest in community grown food, and allotments have an important role in providing space for groups to grow their own produce.""

About 300,000 people are already using allotments, which have an important role to play in helping to reduce carbon emissions. The combined plots in England and Wales are capable of producing more than 240,000 tons of food. The same amount of imported produce is equivalent to 116 journeys by 40 ton articulated lorries each week.

### Notes to editors

1. Neighbourhood Plans will give communities radical new rights to determine the look and feel of their area and a much greater ability to shape local development. Local people will be able to use Neighbourhood Plans to allocate land for allotments.

2. Further detail on Neighbourhood Planning proposals and the seventeen communities currently trialling Neighbourhood Planning can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1879129](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1879129). In Bermondsey, for example, the community is looking at whether green space on council estates could be used to provide allotments, as part of their neighbourhood plan.

3. The report Allotments in England Report of Survey 2006 is published for the first time today. The report is a partial survey of local authorities, which examines comparisons and trends relating to allotments for the period 1996-2006. It demonstrates a reduction of plots and sites; reduction of vacant plots and an increase in waiting list numbers across all allotments, including in community gardens and city farms.

  
  


 

4. Section 23 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908 states that allotment authorities (parish councils or district councils) must provide a sufficient number of allotments and let them to persons resident in the area (where they are of the opinion that there is a demand).  This duty is amended for inner London boroughs to a discretionary power to provide allotments by section 55(4) of the London Government Act 1963. There are no plans to change this requirement.

5. The Government does not intend to remove the statutory requirement that local authorities must seek the Secretary of State's agreement to dispose of or use statutory allotments for other purposes.

6. Surveys undertaken by West Kirby Transition Town in conjunction with the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners show waiting lists for allotments are considerable.  The latest survey conducted in 2010 estimated that more than 94,000 people are on waiting lists for 159,000 statutory plots managed by principal local authorities (not including those run by parish or town councils or allotment associations).  This equates to 59 people waiting for every 100 plots.  In 1996 there was an average of 4 people for every 100 plots.

7. The National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardens report that the 330,000 combined plots in England and Wales are capable of producing more than 241,560 tons of food.This is equivalent to 116 x 40 ton artic lorry journeys not taken each week, a saving of more than £75,000 in fuel.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1610351,New powers preventing unwanted 'garden grabbing',"Councils and communities are being given new powers to prevent the destructive practice of 'garden grabbing' and to decide what types of homes are suitable for their area, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

**Garden grabbing hotspots** [ ![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1610269.gif)](http://bit.ly/aYgMJY) Map of local authority areas with high rates of garden grabbing.   
[View Map](http://bit.ly/aYgMJY) (external link)

Over the last decade, many councils have been left frustrated at being unable to prevent a dramatic increase in the number of new houses being built on previously residential land such as people's back gardens - up from one in ten to one in four between 1997 and 2008.

Planning guidance has classified gardens as previously residential land', in the same Brownfield category as derelict factories and disused railway sidings, robbing communities of green breathing space, safe places for children to play and havens for urban wildlife.

Mr Clark is today unveiling plans to take gardens out of the Brownfield category, a simple step that will dramatically transform councils' ability to prevent unwanted development on gardens where local people object and protect the character of their neighbourhoods.

From today Mr Clark will also scrap the minimum density target, handing power back to town halls and local communities to decide what new homes are best for their area. The target has contributed to the lack of family sized homes and flats that local people need. Councils will now work with local communities and developers to deliver more family homes and affordable housing the local community.

Greg Clark said:

> ""For years the wishes of local people have been ignored as the character of neighbourhoods and gardens have been destroyed, robbing communities of vital green space.
> 
> ""It is ridiculous that gardens have until now been classified in the same group as derelict factories and disused railway sidings, forcing councils and communities to sit by and watch their neighbourhoods get swallowed up in a concrete jungle.
> 
> ""Today I am changing the classification of garden land so councils and communities no longer have their decisions constantly overruled, but have the power to work with industry to shape future development that is appropriate for their area.
> 
> ""This is just the start of wholescale reform I want to make to the planning system, so councils and communities are centre-stage in a reformed system that works for them, and is not just a tool of top-down policy.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The current system with its push for high density has resulted in developers building one or two bedroom executive flats, when the greatest need is often for affordable family homes. That's why from today communities will be allowed to make their own decisions about what homes are needed in their area, and no longer be victims of a system designed to maximise profits and minimise choice.""

Dr Simon Thornton Wood, Director of Science and Learning at the Royal Horticultural Society said:

> ""We welcome any measure that protects the vital resource we know gardens to be. Gardens like parks, are the green lungs of cities, improving air quality, controlling air temperature and flood risk and providing a haven for wildlife. Beyond these very practical benefits of gardens we know that gardening is great for physical and mental health. That's why we would like planning measures to go further than protecting existing gardens, to guarantee high quality green space and gardening opportunities in all new building developments, wherever they are.""

Richard Bashford - Project Manager, RSPB said:

> ""Gardens are mini nature reserves on our doorsteps and vital habitats for all sorts of wildlife. Many much loved species rely on green spaces like gardens, such as the song thrush and house sparrow, both of which have suffered massive declines in the last few years. House sparrow numbers have plummeted by over 60 per cent and we have lost almost 75 per cent of song thrushes. If more garden space is turned into buildings they will likely decline further and the wonder that children experience on the doorstep will dwindle.
> 
> ""We hope that the new measures will protect the habitats of species that have become synonymous with English gardens and demonstrate a rich eco system in our own back yards such as frogs, toads and bumble bees.""

### Facts on garden grabbing

  * Recent Government figures for 2008 show that 80 per cent of homes were built on Brownfield land, up from 56 per cent in 1997. This incorporates development on previously residential land that includes gardens, which has risen nationally from 11 per cent to 23 per cent between 1997 and 2008, but is much higher in some local areas (see the spreadsheet below)
  * New build statistics show the decline in the number of houses built has largely been for 4+ bed houses, with small declines in 2 and 3 bed houses. There has been a corresponding proportionate increase in 2 bed flats

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1785519,New powers put Londoners in the driving seat,"Londoners are set to benefit from an unprecedented devolution of power from Whitehall, Communities and Local Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

Radical new plans will see the Mayor of London and Borough councils and neighbourhoods handed greater decision making powers over the city's housing, regeneration, economic development, and Olympic legacy as part of the Localism Bill to be published shortly.

These reforms pave the way for further devolution down to the London Boroughs to make sure decisions reflect local priorities including more decisions on planning being put into to the hands of locally-elected London leaders.

Ministers believe that, as things stand, too many major planning applications are decided by the Mayor and there are various unelected bodies taking decisions over London leading to confusion and duplication between City Hall, Government Office for London, the Homes and Communities Agency, London Development Agency and the Olympic Park Legacy Company.

The London Assembly will also gain new scrutiny powers to hold the Mayor to account on behalf of Londoners.

Mr Pickles believes the changes will also restore the democratic deficit in the capital and make it more accountable by putting London's future firmly in the hands of Londoners and their leaders.

The Government has already acted to protect local services by freeing all councils from the straight jacket of ring-fenced funding, regional governance, central targets and inspection as well as wider planning reforms and new incentives for housing and local growth.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""London is a global powerhouse, with global reach - and yet it can't make local decisions on local issues.
> 
> ""Today I'm announcing that we will streamline the way London is run so Londoners a stronger voice with decisions taken by Mayor, Borough leaders and neighbourhoods based on local priorities in the capital.
> 
> ""London is a democracy not a quangocracy and the Mayor has a clear electoral mandate from London voters so he should be at the head of the table.
> 
> ""Instead of quango-itis stifling the pace of London's progress its elected leaders will decide what housing and regeneration investment to make or what London's Olympic legacy should be, all in a more open and transparent way than ever before.""

The full range of powers to strengthen London's governance includes:

  * The devolution of executive powers over housing investment from the Homes and Communities Agency to the Greater London Authority (GLA) so it can be fully aligned with the Mayor's own funding pot and the London Housing Strategy;

  * The abolition of the London Development Agency, with its city-wide roles on regeneration and management of European funding to be transferred to the GLA so that the Mayor is directly accountable. The Government has already announced the end of the Government Office including London (GOL) and the Regional Development Agencies;

  * New powers for the Mayor of London to create Mayoral Development Corporations to focus regeneration where it's needed most, such as to help secure East London's Olympic legacy, in partnership with London Boroughs;

  * Boroughs will be given control over more of the major local planning decisions that affect their local communities. The Mayor will only consider the largest planning applications in future;

  * Streamlining consultation on Mayoral strategies, so there is a single environmental strategy. The Assembly will also gain a new  power to reject the Mayor's final strategies by a two-thirds majority.

### Notes to editors

Measures relating to governance arrangements for the Metropolitan Police are being considered as part of wider Home office reforms and measures relating to the management of the Royal Parks are being considered separately.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1924848,New powers will put faith groups at the centre of their communities,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today urged faith groups to make use of new powers in the Government's Localism Bill to end their reliance on the goodwill of local authorities alone, and strengthen their arm in playing an active and visible role in society.

Speaking to the Cinnamon Network - a faith-based charities group - the Secretary of State outlined the Government's continued financial support and commitment to faith groups. He acknowledged that faith groups - often engaged in vital work within communities - can face barriers in terms of securing funding from local authorities and endless unnecessary red tape.

Mr Pickles argued that a misplaced suspicion of faith groups risks society missing out on opportunities to make the most of their enthusiasm and expertise, whilst health and safety zealots pushing rules and red tape beyond the realms of taking care of people makes it unnecessarily hard for people to play their part.

He used the speech to outline how this Government is committed to giving faith groups new powers and freedoms to act in their communities, from the running of public services to taking over much-loved local assets. He also pledged to help to overcome red tape and petty regulation that stands in their way of getting further involved in local life.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""In the eyes of some, being religious is seen as being 'weird'. They don't want public discussion about faith, and don't want faith to have a role in our communities. Everyone - whether religious or secular - loses out from that kind of attitude.
> 
> ""We need to ensure that all our faith groups have every opportunity to make their mark. To restore some common sense, give them new powers and freedoms, and remove the over-the-top bureaucracy and red tape that stands in their way. So we are changing the balance putting faith groups on surer footing with new rights to have a say and to challenge that will open the door for faith groups to get further involved in local life.""

The Localism Bill - currently going through The House of Lords - includes two key measures that place power in the hands of local charities and local people giving them a greater say over what happens in their area.

First under the Community Right to Challenge community, voluntary sector and faith groups with bright ideas on how services could be better run will be given new powers to challenge and take over local services, such as meals on wheels, or homelessness support. Second, under the Community Right to Buy they will be given greater opportunities to have a fair chance to take over, save or transform local buildings. This could see for example a run-down village hall transformed into a centre for social enterprise.

Ministers have also set out a reasonable set of expectations of how local authorities should behave towards faith, voluntary and community groups. They have made clear that whilst councils have challenging decisions to make around their spending priorities they should avoid passing on disproportionate cuts to the voluntary sector. Charities and volunteers should be included in local debates about future services and should be given at least three months' notice when councils decide to end grants or payments under contract.

### Notes to editors

1. Set up in October 2010, the Cinnamon Network is a group of over 40 Chief Executive Officers of faith-based charities developing responses to the Government's Big Society agenda.

2. The Government continues to recognise the importance of faith organisations to local communities. Earlier this year, £5m was awarded to the Church Urban Fund for the 'Near Neighbours' programme, £5,000 each for small-scale, grass-roots projects designed to bring people of different backgrounds together.

3. Research commissioned by the Cinnamon Network shows that almost 70 per cent of Churches plan to increase their social action initiatives this year.

4. Putting a monetary value on the contribution faiths make is not easy, but the Cinnamon Network commissioned research reveals that churches and their congregations contribute significant time as well as monies to their communities. The 284 churches involved in the sample delivered a total of 439,000 hours of volunteer service in the last 212 months, which equates to 1,925 per church on average; These churches contributed £1,234,000 to finance social action work, or £7,568 per church, spent on an average of 3.3 projects; Projecting these figures against population and church going for the UK gives an estimate of 72 million hours of volunteering for Church-led initiatives over 12 months.The Cinnamon Network research into the Church's current involvement in local social action, is available at [www.brin.ac.uk/news/?tag=cinnamon-network](http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/?tag=cinnamon-network) (external link).

5. The Localism Bill includes new rights for local communities, including the Community Right to Buy and the Community Right to Challenge. The Government has consulted on both rights and will be responding shortly.

6. Those faith groups who are finding it hard to get things done because of excessive red tape, rules and regulations can get in touch with Communities and Local Government through our 'barrier busting' website at [http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1769410,New proposals for planning fees to make a fairer system,"Proposals for a fairer planning fees system are being set out today for consultation.

At the moment local council taxpayers have been left subsidising the costs of dealing with planning applications.

Councils have been unable to recover the true costs of applications because of a fixed fee charging system set by central Government. This has meant local taxpayers having to make up any shortfall in revenue through their council tax bills.

Local authorities and developers have argued for greater flexibility in the system so there is enough revenue to cover the costs. Under new proposals - set out today in a consultation - local councils will be given the power to set their own fees to cover costs. They will not be able to make a profit on fees but they will be able to recover the actual cost of submitting an application from those benefiting.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""Having a system where Whitehall dictates to local councils what planning fees they can charge is very unfair for local taxpayers around the country who are left paying for the shortfall where fees don't cover costs.
> 
> ""Letting councils set their own fees is a much fairer system for both the applicant and the local taxpayer and will ensure there is flexibility in the system to recover the actual costs of applications.""

David Cook, Chief Executive at Kettering Borough Council said:

> ""The current system of nationally set fees means that, typically, councils don't recover the full costs of processing large commercial planning applications. This cost has to be met and thus results in an extra burden on local council tax-payers. The proposals in the consultation should address this.""

Simon Loomes, Strategic Projects Director at The Portman Estate added:

> ""I welcome the consultation on decentralising planning application fees to the local level. It is essential that local authorities are properly resourced to respond in a proportionate and timely way to applications which in the main represent economic progress.""

National fees fail to take into account that local authorities have different resources and so incur different costs. Councils setting their own charges will mean fees in some areas may increase but similarly in other areas fees will fall to cover actual costs.

### Notes to Editors

1. Research commissioned from Arup in February 2009 to re-examine planning application costs and fees suggests that fees were approximately 10 per cent below associated costs. This is based on an overall average cost of £619 per application and an average fee of £563.

2. If proposals on decentralising planning fees are taken forward following consultation, local authorities will be able to set their own fees from April 2011. They will be given six months from April to October to publish their fees. During that period they will be able to use the current fees set by Government; these will be withdrawn in October.

3. Planning application fees constitute a very small portion of development costs - less than half a percent. Business will benefit from fees that are more transparent and more accurately based on cost.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1840403,New protections for residents of park homes announced,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has announced new rights for those who live in park homes that will allow them to resolve disputes with site owners quickly and more easily, and ensure that their sites are safe and better maintained.

Under changes to existing legislation, residents will be given access to a dedicated, low cost specialist housing tribunal, which can deal with cases quickly and without the need for legal representation. This removes the prospect of large legal costs which currently puts park home residents off taking action to resolve disputes with site owners.

Residential Property Tribunals will take over most of the powers currently assigned to County Courts under the Mobile Homes Act 1983, and will put park homes residents and their owners on a level playing field when working to resolve disputes.

Mr Shapps also announced his plans to consult on new measures to modernise the licensing of caravan and park home sites and allow local authorities to monitor and enforce licences better, thus protecting the many thousands of mainly older people who live on these sites.

Under the changes that will be put to consultation this Spring, local authorities would be given the power to charge site owners for licensing - a function that is currently funded by the tax payer or not provided at all to a satisfactory standard where authorities do not have the resources.

The proposals would also give local authorities the power to carry out emergency works on sites where the owner had failed to do so, and charge the cost back to them.

Other proposals to tackle unscrupulous site owners will also include preventing them from unreasonably blocking sales of homes, by removing their role in approving purchasers, a power which would instead be transferred to the Residential Property Tribunal.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Park homes play an important role in the housing market by offering an affordable alternative to mainstream housing for many people, and the reforms I intend to consult on will modernise the licensing system and make it more effective in ensuring that sites are safe and properly managed.
> 
> ""Many residents appreciate and value the sense of community that park home living offers, but I know there is concern about what appears to be abuse by some site owners. Failings by site owners can significantly impact upon the well-being of the local communities.
> 
> ""And that is why I have announced my intention to consult on giving courts the power to impose higher fines for the most serious breaches of licences, allow councils to carry out works where site owners refuse to do so, and extend the role of the Residential Property Tribunal in the sales process.
> 
> ""These proposed changes will help us tackle the unscrupulous owners who are failing in their duties and eliminate the unacceptable practice of a small minority of site owners who routinely block sales for their own financial gain.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1841582,New publicity rules for councils published,"New rules to stop taxpayers' money being spent on town hall newspapers or hired lobbyists have been put before Parliament, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

In recent years there has been a marked growth in the frequency and scope of council publicity techniques funded by taxpayers' money, whilst local papers have struggled in a saturated news environment.

Mr Pickles has raised strong concerns over the frequency of council papers, politically contentious advertising and use of lobbyists, pledging to rewrite the rule book. He believes councils should redirect resources into protecting front line services.

The new 'publicity code' for English councils tightens up the rules to protect the use of taxpayers' money being spent inappropriately. Following consultation it sets out specific rules to stop municipal newspapers being published more often than four times a year and to prevent the hiring of lobbyists.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""An independent local press is an essential part of our open democracy and it is a vital part of local accountability, but the rules around council publicity have been too weak for too long squandering public funds and pushing local newspapers out into the abyss.
> 
> ""Some councils have pushed this to the limits and were effectively lobbying on the rates. The changes will end the weekly Town Hall freesheets, stop professional lobbyists being hired and make advertising guidelines crystal clear so councils know exactly when misuse of public funds is a breach of the code.
> 
> ""Councils need to give due diligence to their communications operation and make sure every effort has been made to focus taxpayers' money to where it should be spent - protecting frontline services.""

The revised Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity includes seven new central principles that make sure that council publicity is lawful, cost effective, objective, even handed and appropriate, and that it has regard to equality and diversity and is issued with care during periods of heightened sensitivity.

In particular, the new rules would define 'appropriate use of publicity' in relation to council newspapers and use of lobbyists:

  * Advertising should be balanced, factually accurate and not likely to be perceived by the public as a political statement or a commentary on contentious areas of public policy.
  * Councils should not publish newspapers in direct competition to local press. They should not appear more than quarterly and should only include material directly related to local services.
  * Councils should not spend taxpayers' money to lobby government through private sector lobbyists or through publicity stalls at party conferences.

### Notes to editors

  1. Full details of new Government Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycode2011](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycode2011).
  2. The Code was originally introduced in 1988 and amended by the last Government in 2001. The revised Code applies to England only. The purpose of the Code was to ensure proper use of public funds for publicity. Effective, efficient publicity that successfully tells the public what they need to know about the services and activities of their council is legitimate; the public need information to hold their authority to account. The Publicity Code is statutory guidance to which local authorities have to have regard in the production of their publicity.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2128931,New reforms will stop town hall corruption and culture of malicious complaints,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill today called on councils to use their new found freedom from the recently axed Standards Board to prevent corruption and ensure high standards in local public life.

The Standards Board Regime has now been abolished for good - freeing up councils to put in place locally drawn up codes of conduct for their elected members. Ministers hope these new codes will enable local authorities to ensure the highest standards of conduct are maintained while avoiding them becoming a vehicle for malicious complaints that dragged down the reputation of local government in recent years.

Today Mr Neill published an illustrative text that councils can, if they choose, use as a basis for their new local code of conduct. He has also written to council leaders to remind them of this new opportunity to raise the bar on local standards.

The new code is a matter for local determination, but the Department is publishing an example code illustrating what a new code might look like. By releasing councils from the old regime of prescriptive uniform codes councils will be able to ensure that their own codes encourage freedom of speech and can not be used to silence or discourage conscientious councillors from whistle blowing on misconduct.

The new freedoms to draw up local codes will come as a particularly welcome relief to smaller authorities and parish councils, where the burden of investigating unnecessary and frivolous complaints weighed heavily on resources.

Ministers believe that the previous Standards Board regime, which was axed as part of the Government's flagship Localism Act 2011, had become a vehicle for petty and sometimes vexatious complaints about councillor conduct that drained time and resources and damaged local confidence in democracy. For example, one authority had to fork out £160,000 after receiving more than 170 complaints from the same person. Each one had to be examined, but only three were considered worth investigating and after investigation all were dismissed.

Ministers are determined to ensure local councillors are held to the highest standards of conduct. To ensure that corruption in local life is prevented, the Government is bringing in tough new legislation that makes serious misconduct for personal gain a criminal offence, dealt with by the courts. Councillors will also have to register certain personal interests on a publicly available register.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""As the death knell tolls for the unpopular and unelected Standards Board regime, councils and communities can look forward to a new era of locally set codes of conduct that will prevent corruption, ensure high standards in public life, and put an end to petty, partisan and malicious complaints that have dragged down the reputation of local government.
> 
> ""Instead of having hundreds of expensive and frivolous investigations hanging over their heads local councillors will be free to get on with the job of getting the best for their local area. But far from letting councillors off the hook without any checks we are ensuring that they conform to the highest standards and anyone who abuses their position for personal gain can expect to face the full force of the law.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Standards Board for England ceased its regulatory functions on 31 January 2012, and was formally abolished on 31 March 2012.

2. The illustrative example of what a local code of conduct could look like can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localcodeconduct](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localcodeconduct).

3. From 1 July 2012, all standards matters - including consideration and determination of outstanding complaints made during the period the Standards Board regime was operating - will be the responsibility of local authorities, to be handled under the new arrangements. This date will also see the new standards arrangements, which include a 'Nolan-based' code, the involvement of an independent person in allegations of misconduct, and a new criminal offence for failing to declare or register interests, coming into force.

4. The abolition of the Standards Board was included in the Localism Act. The Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1858342,New report shows resilient seaside towns can take new chance to grow,"Resilient small seaside resorts can seize the opportunity presented by local enterprise partnerships to transform economic growth along our coast, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

A new report by Sheffield Hallam University on small seaside towns, paints a compelling picture of economic and social challenges, enterprise and resilience over the last decade.

Classic seaside towns - mainly in the South West and East Coast - missed out on the economic growth of the past decade that centred on London and the South East, the report finds. But despite this smaller resorts have often done better than their larger counterparts - for example experiencing a smaller rise in unemployment during the recession.

The report finds smaller seaside towns are more reliant on the seaside tourist trade despite lacking the ""more diverse economic base that in many larger seaside towns dilutes the local dependence on tourism and retirement"". Research last year found UK seaside tourism has remained healthy and overall employment in tourism in seaside towns is increasing as more people holiday in the UK.

The Government sees business as the driver of economic growth and innovation. Ministers are committed to urgent action to boost enterprise, rebalancing local economies so that new businesses and economic opportunities spread across the country.

Local enterprise partnerships are central to this vision, bringing together local business and civic leaders who will operate within a geography that reflects natural economic areas to drive private sector growth and job creation.

Mr Pickles believe today's report underlines the need for a new approach to coastal resorts, which have growth potential that needs to be harnessed locally. Local enterprise partnerships are putting local councils and local businesses back in charge of economic growth so they can transform places from the ground up.

Over three quarters of these resorts are now covered by local enterprise partnerships. All areas are expected to be covered over the next few months.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Seaside towns play a vital part in the country's £115 billion a year tourism industry.
> 
> ""Today's report paints a picture of resilience and enterprise in rural seaside towns, despite missing out on the London centric growth and prosperity of the past decade.
> 
> ""Small coastal resorts have shown they can build stronger, more diverse economies when given the chance. The new network of local enterprise partnerships will give local communities and local businesses the chance to transform economic growth along our coast and our localist business support will also help them thrive all year round.""

### Notes to editors

1. The report by Sheffield Hallam University looked into 37 of the country's smaller seaside towns with populations lower than 10,000. It is available here [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/smallerseasidetownbenchmarking](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/smallerseasidetownbenchmarking).

Key findings include:

  * Smaller seaside towns to be more reliant on the seaside tourist trade. Low wages, seasonal unemployment, retirement destinations and a proliferation of small businesses are more common than larger seaside towns.

  * In some areas smaller seaside towns have done well relative to England on key indicator including employment growth (pre-recession), claimant count (to January 2010), household overcrowding, health deprivation and crime.

  * Over 40 per cent of the jobs in the towns are in distribution, hotels and restaurants - the main sector where tourist-related jobs are concentrated. This compares to an England average of 23 per cent.

  * The data suggests that Aldeburgh, Arnside, Budleigh Salterton, Grange over Sands, Lynton/ Lynmouth, Portreath, Salcombe and West Mercia have strongest local economies among smaller seaside towns.

  * Those facing toughest economic problems, are: Chapel St Leonards; Cromer; Dymchurch/St Mary's Bay; Filey; Hunstanton; Mablethorpe; Sutton on Sea; Watchet; and Withernsea. Seven of the nine towns are on the East Coast.

2. The Government is committed to growing the domestic tourism market including seaside resorts. The Prime Minister announced progress on a £100m international marketing initiative, jointly funded by VisitBritain and private sector partners, in January. The Government's forthcoming tourism strategy will set out ways tourism can support the wider enterprise and employment agenda. The seaside industry in England and Wales directly supports some 210,000 jobs.

3. Coastal businesses that are eligible for small business rate relief, will benefit from the Government's doubling of the normal business rate discount, worth £390m, for a year from October that will benefit over half a million businesses. Backdated business rates bills of £175m have also been waived, giving a lifeline to many struggling firms in port towns.

4. Seaside towns will also benefit from the Government giving councils the power to set local discounts on business rates, provided that they are funded locally. Ministers have also set out radical new proposals to let councils keep the business rates they collect locally giving them genuine incentives to promote local economic growth.

5. Local groups will also be able to take advantage of the Government's plan to introduce new powers to help local communities save local facilities (like piers and community centres) and services threatened with closure. The Localism Bill, currently going through Parliament, will allow local people to take them over and run them as community businesses.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1730322,New repossession rules to protect tenants from being booted out without notice,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today welcomed new rules which mean that tenants will no longer live in fear of being booted out of their home with little or no notice.

Before today, if a landlord has not been given consent to let out their property from their lender, and later faces repossession action, the tenants could be left vulnerable since the courts were unable to take account of their circumstances and many were placed in the distressing situation of being given very short notice to find a new place to live.

But new rules, coming into force today, mean that tenants will for the first time be able to attend the court hearing, and judges will be able to take their situation into account and delay repossession by up to two months to give them more time to find a new home.

Guidance published today makes clear the rights these tenants have when their landlord faces repossession action, but also sets out the steps lenders must take. These changes come as part of the Mortgage Repossessions (Protection of Tenants etc) Act 2010.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Of course all landlords should get permission from their lender before renting out their home. But when landlords don't, and they face the real prospect of repossession, their tenants should not be left worse off than any other tenant as a result.
> 
> ""That's why I backed the Mortgage Repossessions Bill last year so tenants can have their voices heard in court, and can get enough time to find a new place to live.
> 
> ""As with all homeowners, I expect lenders to seek repossession only as a last resort. But where action is being taken against a landlord, their tenants must get a fair amount of time to find themselves a new home.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1621887,New research shows a nudge helps people develop the tools to build the Big Society,"A nudge in the right direction and tailored feedback from councillors and members of voluntary groups, increases people's willingness to get involved in their neighbourhoods and help build the Big Society.

New research from the universities of Manchester and Southampton suggests people are more likely to get involved in local community activities such as increasing recycling or through measures such as recycling and volunteering, if they get feedback on what a difference their contribution can and will make.

### Individuals making a difference

The university findings confirm what many, such as Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark have long suspected - that individuals can make a major difference to their community given the right opportunity and that a nudge from their local council or volunteer group can be the key to success.

Findings from the research include:

  * door-to-door canvassing by a local social enterprise led to a 10 per cent increase in kerbside recycling
  * provision of tailored information about organ donation resulted in a 17 per cent increase in registered donors
  * book donations to set up school libraries in South Africa going up by 22 per cent as a result of the names of donors being displayed in the local drop off points.

Welcoming the findings, Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark, said:

> ""This research confirms my fundamental belief that people are perfectly willing and able to take the lead in transforming their neighbourhoods; and the more they take pride in the places they live, the more they want to contribute. The old fashioned use of rules, instructions and directions often fails, whereas helping people to do the things they want to succeeds. I welcome the work by Manchester and Southampton Universities - it shows that citizens together can create the Big Society.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1727284,New rules rein in town hall freesheets and use of lobbyists,"New proposals to stop taxpayers' money being squandered on town hall newspapers or hired lobbyists have been announced by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today.

In recent years there has been a marked growth in the frequency and scope of council publicity techniques funded by taxpayers' money, whilst local papers have struggled in a saturated news environment.

A consultation published today outlines new proposals to tighten up the publicity rules for councils so they guard against campaigning with public funds. Mr Pickles has previously raised strong concerns over such practices and pledged to rewrite the rule book.

Today's proposals set out specific rules to stop municipal newspapers being published more often than four times a year and to prevent the hiring of lobbyists. Instead, Ministers believe councils should redirect resources into protecting front line services.

The proposals also give more transparency and certainty to local authorities and political parties about exhibition stands at party conferences, for example, by distinguishing between the promotion of a local area for tourism purposes and the taxpayer-funded lobbying of politicians.

Mr Pickles emphasised that he believed the assumption should be that all council publicity would be clearly branded material, issued solely to explain services, and not to influence opinion.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""An independent local press is an essential part of our open democracy helping local people scrutinise and hold elected councillors to account.
> 
> ""The rules around council publicity have been too weak for too long allowing public money to be spent on wasteful town hall papers that have left many local newspapers looking over the abyss.
> 
> ""The proposals I am publishing today will close off these inappropriate practices and encourage councils to focus taxpayers' money on where it should be spent - protecting frontline services.""

The revised Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity includes proposals for seven new central principles that will make sure that council publicity is lawful, cost effective, objective, even handed and appropriate, and that it has regard to equality and diversity and is issued with care during periods of heightened sensitivity.

In particular, the new rules would define 'appropriate use of publicity' in relation to council newspapers and use of lobbyists:

  * Councils should not publish newspapers in direct competition to local press. They should not appear more than quarterly and should only include material directly related to council services.
  * Councils should not spend taxpayers' money to lobby government through private sector lobbyists or through publicity stalls at party conferences.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2114110,New rules to ensure fair play on planning,"Government issues new planning guidance on traveller sites

Local Government Minister Bob Neill has published a radically streamlined planning policy that will ensure fair treatment of travellers in the planning system while respecting the interests of the settled community.

Condensing the previous 54 pages of traveller site guidance into just eight pages, the new policy puts the provision of sites back into the hands of local councils, in consultation with local communities.

Ministers believe planning rules have seriously harmed community relations over the last few years, by imposing top-down targets for traveller sites on local councils, increasing the number of unauthorised sites, and compelling councils to encroach onto the Green Belt. At the same time ministers believe that policy introduced under the previous administration created a perception of special treatment for some travellers undermining the notion of 'fair play' in the planning system and further harming community cohesion.

The Government is committed to the protection of the nation's green spaces and this policy will protect Green Belt land and countryside. Traveller sites are an inappropriate development on Green Belt land and the new guidance makes clear that there should be due regard for the protection of the local environment and amenities when local authorities set out their criteria for allocating sites.

The new measures continue the Government's policy of abolishing top-down targets set by central government. Previously the Government has abolished the architecture of regional planning tiers through the Localism Act to prevent any more regional strategies being created and set out measures in the Localism Act to provide stronger enforcement powers for local authorities to tackle unauthorised developments and abuse of retrospective planning permission.

The new planning policy also gives councils the freedom and responsibility to determine the right level of traveller site provision in their area, in consultation with local communities, while ensuring fairness in the planning system.

The result of these changes will reduce tensions between settled and traveller communities whilst enabling provision of accommodation from which travellers can access education, health, welfare and employment infrastructure.

Mr Neill said:

> ""Top-down targets from central Government failed to provide adequate land for travellers and caused tensions with the local settled community. People want to see fair play in the planning system, treating everyone fairly and equally.
> 
> ""These new policies will allow local authorities to govern their own affairs whilst ensuring that both travellers and the settled communities get a fair deal through the planning system.""

The new policy forms part of a broader package, including changes to planning law to limit retrospective planning applications for any form of unauthorised development and the provision of incentives for new and refurbished traveller sites, which will deliver a better balance between site provision and enforcement.

The Government has also been looking at the inequalities faced by traveller groups and will shortly be publishing a report from the Ministerial Working Group.

### Notes to editors

1. The full planning policy for traveller sites can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/planningpolicytravellers](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/planningpolicytravellers).

2. The Government's key aims in respect of traveller sites are:

  * that local planning authorities should make their own assessment of need for the purposes of planning;
  * to ensure that local planning authorities, working collaboratively, develop fair and effective strategies to meet need through the identification of land for sites;
  * to encourage local planning authorities to plan for sites over a reasonable timescale;
  * that plan-making and decision-taking should protect the Green Belt from inappropriate development;
  * to promote more private traveller site provision while recognising that there will always be those travellers who cannot provide their own sites;
  * that plan-making and decision-taking should aim to reduce the number of unauthorised developments and encampments and make enforcement more effective;
  * for local planning authorities to ensure their local plan includes fair, realistic and inclusive policies;
  * to increase the number of traveller sites in appropriate locations with planning permission, to address under-provision and maintain an appropriate level of supply;
  * to reduce tensions between settled and traveller communities in plan-making and planning decisions;
  * to enable provision of suitable accommodation from which travellers can access education, health, welfare and employment infrastructure; and
  * for local planning authorities to have due regard to the protection of local amenities and the local environmental.

3. The Department has previously announced the inclusion of traveller sites in the New Homes Bonus to reward councils that deliver additional sites. This means that councils will get financial benefits for building authorised traveller sites where they are needed. The Department has also secured £60 million Traveller Pitch Funding to help councils and other registered providers build new traveller sites. Successful bids totalling £47 million were announced in January, helping to provide over 750 new and refurbished pitches for travellers.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1861993,New seamless arrangements for major infrastructure planning will ensure stability and a 21st century system,"New arrangements to ensure a smooth and stable transition to a democratic system for major infrastructure planning decisions have been announced by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today.

The Government is setting out the next steps to return democratic accountability to major infrastructure applications, while maintaining the essential expertise, stability and speed of the existing system.

This will ensure it is 'business as usual' during the transition to the new Major Infrastructure Planning Unit, which will sit within the future integrated Planning Inspectorate, and will mean developers can rest assured the transfer will not delay applications.

Sir Michael Pitt, currently Chair of the Infrastructure Planning Commission will become Chief Executive of the Planning Inspectorate when Katrine Sporle, the Inspectorate's Chief Executive, retires at the end of March. Katrine has made a significant contribution to the Inspectorate and helped build both its reputation and track record during her tenure.

The current team of commissioners examining applications at the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be retained to ensure a high quality professional system continues with no unnecessary delays in the examination of applications. This work will move to the Major Infrastructure Planning Unit once the Localism Bill receives Royal Assent.

Sir Michael will divide his time equally between both organisations and will become the full time Chief Executive of the Planning Inspectorate following closure of the Infrastructure Planning Commission, on a fixed term basis through to April 2014. He has a wealth of relevant experience and brings the energy and commitment required to make the transition a success.

Mr Clark said:

> ""It is vital we have a planning system that is swift and efficient, and that captures the confidence of business and communities alike.
> 
> ""The Major Infrastructure Planning Unit, within the Planning Inspectorate, will be at the forefront of helping deliver growth and investment in this country and key to ensuring we have an infrastructure planning system fit for the 21st century.
> 
> ""The new leadership arrangements being brought in with Sir Michael Pitt at the helm and the retention of the Commissioners will ensure a smooth transition to restoring democratic accountability to major infrastructure planning decisions, while maintaining the expertise, stability and speed of the current system.
> 
> ""Developers can rest assured it will be business as usual during the transition with no unnecessary delays.""

### Notes to editors

  1. Sir Michael Pitt was formerly Chief Executive of Cheshire and Kent County Councils. He has been Chair of the Infrastructure Planning Commission since 1 May 2009.
  2. He will take on his additional role within the Planning Inspectorate on 1 April 2011 on a fixed term contract until 30 April 2014, in line with his original five year contract at the Infrastructure Planning Commission. His role at the Inspectorate will become full-time once the Commission closes.
  3. Katrine Sporle was awarded a CBE for outstanding public service in the 2011 New Year's Honours.
  4. Commissioners currently working at the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be retained within the Planning Inspectorate until September 2014.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1656427,New steps to cut the cost of moving home and open up the books,"Home buyers can access more information about their new home without having to pay for the information, the Government announced today.

The fixed fee charged for personal searches of councils' local land charges register is to be abolished. Such land searches tell a home buyer about restrictions or issues that affect the property, such as planning conditions, conservation areas and protected trees.

The new Government has already suspended costly and bureaucratic Home Information Packs. Today's move will further help reduce costs for home buyers.

The law is now being changed to stop people being charged a £22 fee for a personal search of the Local Land Charges Register. This move is intended to make key environmental information more accessible to the public.

Making sure that this information can be accessed free of charge fits with the Government's wider drive for 'open data' to make public sector information more transparent and accessible to the public online. Local councils are in the forefront of this agenda to increase accountability and open up the books.

Housing Minister, Grant Shapps, said:

> ""Moving home is difficult and stressful, and the new Government wants to make it easier. We've already taken steps to scrap Home Information Packs, and now we are cutting the cost of researching the detail about your new home.
> 
> ""This shows in practice how freeing up public sector data and opening up the books can benefit the whole economy, by cutting transaction costs and increasing competition.""

### Notes for editors

A 'local authority land search' tells a potential home buyer about potential issues or restrictions affecting the home. For example, if the house is in a conservation area that would limit an extension or if there is a protected tree that cannot be cut down. A 'personal search' is a check of records undertaken by an individual, inspecting the records in person. Until now, legislation under the Local Land Charge Rules 1977 stated that a £22 fixed fee should be charged for this information.

Today's measures are being introduced to ensure compliance with European law because information on the local land charges register is overwhelmingly environmental information. The Environmental Information Regulations say that examination of environmental information on site should be free of charge.

The Government is liaising with local councils to provide guidance and assistance on the changes, and to tackle the financial impact. The Local Government Association has been asked to work with Government to assess the impact of removing this fixed fee on local authority finances.

The Government is also working with councils to see how a whole range of public sector information can be opened up to the public in an open and standardised manner.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2033731,New strategy to deliver homes and strengthen the economy,"An ambitious new strategy to tackle the housing shortage, boost the economy, create jobs and give people the opportunity to get on the housing ladder was announced today (21 November 2011) by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister said the Government has inherited a broken housing market and a devastating collapse in construction from the era of top down targets, but new plans will give the housing market a shot in the arm by boosting supply, easing financial pressures and helping with demand. The action we take will drive up the level of housebuilding, ensure we are helping new home owners and boost consumer confidence.

The Strategy will break the current cycle in which lenders won't lend, builders can't build and buyers can't buy. We'll be making it easier for people to secure mortgages on new homes, help people get on the property ladder, address unfairness in social housing and ensure homes that have been left empty for years are lived in once again.

### Help for home buyers

At the heart of the strategy is a new build indemnity scheme that will give a helping hand for up to 100,000 prospective buyers who are currently frozen out of the housing market because of the need for large deposits.

Under the proposals, homebuyers will be able to secure loans on newly built homes - the bedrock of the first time buyer market - with only a five per cent deposit.

The Government and housebuilders will help provide security for the loan, so if the house is then sold for less than the outstanding mortgage total the lender will be able to recover its loss.

Through the scheme lenders will be encouraged to offer mortgages with smaller deposits, increasing demand for new homes and giving a welcome boost to the housing market.  
   
The Government will also consult shortly on proposals to increase discounts under the Right to Buy, giving social tenants the opportunity to buy the homes they live in. The discount will be improved dramatically and will be up to half the value of the home, making home ownership ever more achievable.

For the first time, the receipts from additional Right to Buy sales will be used to support the funding of new affordable homes for rent on a 'one for one' basis, which is expected to deliver up to 100,000 new homes and support 200,000 jobs.

### Help for housebuilders

Assistance for people buying homes will be matched by support for the people who build them, from the largest housebuilder to people who want to build their own homes.

Affordable housing providers are in line to share almost £1.8bn cash to develop new affordable homes. The first £1bn worth of contracts  under the Affordable Homes Programme  have just been confirmed, putting the Government on track to deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes across the country over the next four years.

The Government will give more support for local areas that want to deliver new, larger-scale developments that meet the needs of their growing communities. A new prospectus will be published shortly inviting councils and communities to identify opportunities for locally planned large scale development, which will take advantage of streamlined planning processes, giving communities a stronger say and developers greater certainty.

The new plots could vary in size, from a small expansion of a few hundred homes through to a new market town with up to 10,000 homes. Viable schemes that are sustainable and have strong local support will be given financial assistance to get the work going, and will be prioritised for future infrastructure spending.

Where there are existing building sites that have stalled, a £400m Get Britain Building funding pot will enable housebuilders to restart construction, helping to deliver up to 16,000 new homes on sites that already have planning permission, but have been shut down because of economic conditions.

The new support on offer will also benefit self builders, an industry often assumed to be out of reach for some, but one that is increasingly popular and already worth £3.6 billion for the national economy. We are announcing £30 million additional funding to support provision of short term project finance on a repayable basis.

Councils will receive support to work with local people and bring forward plans for larger custom-built housing projects, similar to the successful project in Almere in the Netherlands.

All these measures will be supported through the New Homes Bonus, which will ensure that those areas which are growing have the resources to meet the needs of their new residents and existing communities.

### Improving fairness in social housing

Efforts to boost the supply of new homes and help homebuyers will be matched by improving fairness for those living in social homes.

Measures in the strategy will support the radical programme of reform to the system for social housing that is already underway. The Government will consult on 'Pay to Stay' proposals. This will mean that those social tenants on high salaries, such as household incomes of over £100,000 a year, will pay up to market rents if they want to continue living in taxpayer-subsidised homes.

Councils will be given new powers to reject applications for social housing from people who own a perfectly acceptable home of their own. And there will be stronger measures to help tackle the outrage of 50,000 unlawfully-occupied social homes - with a more detailed consultation to be published later this year.

The overly bureaucratic and complex model of council housing finance will be scrapped too so councils can manage their social housing stock more effectively.

Instead of the revenue generated from social housing being handed over to central Government and redistributed, councils will be able to keep their own receipts, giving them freedom to maintain their housing stock with more efficiency and transparency, in a way that meets local needs.

### Support for the private rented sector

The Strategy will also support greater investment in the private rented sector, a sector which accounts for around 16 per cent of all households.  
Large scale investment will be driven through changes to the tax rules affecting bulk purchases of buy-to-let homes, as well as through measures to encourage the growth of Real Estate Investment Trusts - the globally recognised model for real estate investment that provides low cost access to capital.

An independent review will also consider whether there are barriers to greater large-scale investment in rented housing.

### Action on empty homes

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister said that the fact that for years so little has been done to bring the nation's empty homes back into use is a ""national scandal"". Tackling the 700,000 empty homes across the country is a top priority in the strategy, and a key feature in the drive to increase the provision of affordable housing.

Housing Associations and councils will be able to apply for part of £100m of Government funding to bring empty homes that blight neighbourhoods back into use. The money will be used for innovative housing schemes that will ensure empty properties that ruin neighbourhoods are lived in once again, communities are regenerated and at the same time more affordable housing is provided. Government is also announcing £50 million of further funding to tackle some of the worst concentrations of empty homes.

The schemes will be backed by cash rewards through the New Homes Bonus for councils bringing empty homes back into use, and many schemes will also have wider benefits such as providing excellent training opportunities for local people.

The Government is also consulting on plans to allow councils local discretion to introduce a council tax premium on homes in their area that have been empty for more than two years, to provide a stronger incentive for empty homes' owners to bring them back into use.

### Supporting older people to live independently

The Strategy also focuses on the needs of older people and includes a deal to improve the quality and choice of housing available for older people, which aims to help them to stay independent for longer.

Nearly a third of all homes are occupied by the elderly, and nearly two thirds of the projected increase in the number of households over the next twenty years will be headed by someone aged 65 or over.

So a package of measures will help the elderly adapt their homes, or move into alternative housing, to meet their changing needs. As part of this package the Government will work to develop simple and attractive financial products that help older home owners safely release equity that they can then use to maintain or adapt their homes.

Other reforms set out in the strategy include:

  * transferring housing and planning powers from central government to councils and local people, so that they can shape development in their areas
  * replacing top down targets with powerful cash incentives through the New Homes Bonus, so instead of simply feeling the strain that new building projects place on existing services, communities have a reason to support new development
  * supporting private sector growth by reducing regulation and other burdens on house-builders
  * accelerating the release of public sector land with capacity to build up to 100,000 new homes by 2015, and support up to 200,000 construction and related jobs during development.

### Notes to editors

Laying the Foundations: a housing strategy for England can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011)

Using previously-developed land owned by the public sector to deliver new homes could support as many as 200,000 construction and related jobs, 50,000 in every year of the spending review period.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1612979,New study shows support for new homes,"The British public are far more supportive of new housing developments in their area than commonly thought, according to a new study published today.

Today's _Public Attitudes to Housing_ survey, published by the National Housing and Planning Advisory Unit (NHPAU), finds that more than three quarters of people would support more homes being built in their area, provided that local services such as GP surgeries and schools do not suffer.

Good quality housing design is also important to people with 73 per cent saying they would support the building of more homes if well designed and in keeping with their local area.

Speaking to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) earlier this week, Housing Minister Grant Shapps outlined his plans to introduce incentives for local communities to give the green light to new developments, while at the same time ensuring local services are able to meet the community's needs.

He said:

> ""If we are really serious about supporting people's aspirations for home ownership, the real prize is we must build more homes. For the first time incentives will create direct benefits for local communities, bringing jobs, investment and more homes for local people.
> 
> ""Rather than being told what to build and where, residents of villages, towns and cities will be able to develop their own vision for their place.""

Today's NHPAU survey also shows that while the vast majority of people aspire to own their own homes, their efforts are still being hampered by the economic downturn. While 82 per cent see home ownership as preferable to renting and other forms of tenure, three quarters of 25-34 year olds who do not own a home and expect to rent for the next three years, want to buy but cannot afford to do so.

In his speech to RICS, Mr Shapps heralded the return of an Age of Aspiration for new homeowners, and committed the Coalition Government's support for those struggling to get their first foothold on the housing ladder.

He said:

> ""I believe that it is human nature to aspire to shelter and security - and for the many that means owning the roof over your own head.
> 
> ""And I don't consider it my job as Housing Minister to hold those aspirations back.
> 
> ""With a new Government and despite the enormous financial difficulties the country faces, I want to state clearly today:
> 
> ""The Age of Aspiration is back.""

The project also forms part of the £1.5 billion North Solihull Regeneration project launched in 2005 to transform the three wards of Chelmsley Wood, Smith's Wood and Kingshurst and Fordbridge by improving homes, shops, schools, health and community facilities, transport, the environment and creating jobs.

Councillor Ian Courts, Cabinet Member for Economic Development and Regeneration from Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council explains the importance of the changes.

He said:

> ""The investment into the new village centre at North Arran Way will create a thriving environment both for the local community and for businesses. This project and the wider plans for the area provide the opportunity to do things differently, taking a joined up approach to creating the conditions for economic growth and prosperity in the area.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2082948,New Voluntary and Community Sector Partnership Board meets for the first time,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has announced the line-up of the Department's expanded Voluntary and Community Sector Partnership Board to take on new members drawn from the voluntary sector, including grassroots organisations, innovators and local authorities.

Recognising the crucial role the sector has to play as communities are given new freedoms to achieve their own ambitions, the expanded board will share their on the ground expertise and intelligence on how policies are being delivered, generate new ideas in taking forward strategic challenges, and raise any concerns over progress or barriers to delivery.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""I would like to thank all members who have served on the Board to date. Their contribution to the Department's thinking has been much valued and is an example of how Government and the Voluntary and Community Sector can work together to meet common objectives.
> 
> ""Now that the Localism Act has been passed I've announced the line-up of the Department's expanded Voluntary and Community Sector Partnership Board to include councils, funders and innovators. The new Board will focus on implementation and innovation as communities are given the freedom and flexibility to achieve their own ambitions from the running of local services, given a greater influence over housing and planning decisions and the right to have a fair chance to bid to take over land and buildings that are important to them.""

The restructured Board's involvement will focus on the following key policies:

  * **Neighbourhoods**: Aiming to ensure that citizens are able to make the best of their communities, with neighbourhoods as the building blocks for action
  * **Big Society / community rights**: Trusting people to take control of the decisions that affect them by devolving power closer to neighbourhoods
  * **Planning**: Giving local people and communities more ability to shape the places in which they live by radically reforming the planning system
  * **Housing**: Meeting people's housing aspirations and promoting social mobility; and
  * **Integration**: Creating the conditions for a more integrated society through promoting common ground, responsibility and engagement and empowerment

The newly restructured board met for the first time on 9 December.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2144176,NewBuy guarantee gathers pace as Santander signs up,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today welcomed Santander's decision to start offering mortgages under the NewBuy Guarantee scheme.

Just two months after its launch, Santander has become the fifth lender to become part of the scheme that will help prospective home buyers buy new build properties.

The NewBuy Guarantee scheme enables those looking to get on or move up the property ladder the opportunity to do so with just a fraction of the deposit currently required.

Santander will initially be working closely with four different housebuilders to offer 95 per cent mortgages on their new build properties.

The products available will include:

  * 3 year fixed at 5.49 per cent with a £99 fee
  * 5 year fixed at 5.49 per cent with a £99 fee
  * 7 year fixed at 5.99 per cent with a £99 fee.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's great news that Santander will start offering its customers deals on NewBuy Guarantee properties. As one of the UK's biggest mortgage providers, their participation demonstrates the growing enthusiasm by lenders to get involved in this scheme, and will boost the range of options customers can choose from when buying their newly-built home.
> 
> ""The NewBuy Guarantee is offering a ray of hope for thousands of people who thought their dream of home ownership might never happen. Thanks to the agreements the Government is striking with lenders and builders across the industry, those aspiring to get on the property ladder are now able to do so with a fraction of the deposit they needed before.""

Phil Cliff, Director of Santander Mortgages, Santander said:

> ""Santander is delighted to be joining the NewBuy scheme and has launched a range of competitively priced products with low upfront fees which reflect our commitment to NewBuy and customers, particularly first time buyers looking to get a start on the housing ladder. The range will have wide appeal and is designed to meet the needs of both first-time buyers looking to buy their first home and existing homes owners who are considering moving house.
> 
> ""Sales of new homes have suffered since the economic downturn in 2008 and borrowers with smaller deposits have found it more difficult to access funding to purchase new homes. NewBuy has collectively brought together lenders, builders and the Government to provide a solution to increasing the supply of affordable credit on new build homes. The NewBuy scheme provides a strong platform to help get the overall housing market going and will also have positive benefits on the wider UK economy.""

The four builders working with Santander are:

  * Barratt Homes

  * Berkeley Homes

  * Bovis Homes; and

  * Persimmon.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1723670,No Council Tax revaluation tax rises pledge ministers,"Local taxpayers have been reassured that there will be no unexpected wave of council tax revaluation hikes in the next five years.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and Treasury Minister David Gauke have today confirmed that the Government will not carry out a council tax revaluation in England during the lifetime of this Parliament.

In addition an independent Data Protection Audit of the Valuation Office Agency's (VOA) council tax database is to be carried out to make sure people's privacy is protected when the Agency assesses properties and stores data. This takes forward the Coalition's desire to defend civil liberties, restore the rights of individuals and in keeping with Britain's tradition of freedom and fairness.

There are also plans for a broader local government resource review that will examine the way councils are funded, to provide greater financial freedoms and decrease dependency on Whitehall funding, which has previously pushed up council tax in many local authorities due to so-called 'gearing' effects.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""We are today confirming that there will be no council tax revaluation which could have pushed up taxes on people's homes. The new Government will protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens and halt state inspectors from unnecessary intrusion.
> 
> ""We are standing up for people who have pride in their home, and calling time on the surveillance state.
> 
> ""Hefty council tax bills are a constant financial worry for many people. Today we are setting their minds at ease, and protecting the interests of the less well-off in particular.""

David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, added:

> ""We want fairness in the tax system. Therefore this Government will avoid an unnecessary and expensive revaluation that could lead to increased council tax bills. The Government is committed to being open about its work while protecting the privacy of personal data. To provide assurance on this point, the Valuation Office Agency is commissioning an independent Data Protection Audit of the council tax database.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Coalition Government is committed to undertaking a full review of local government finance. This is due to report in summer 2012.

2. On 23 September the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) published statistics on the numbers of dwellings by Council Tax band and by property attributes, as at 13 September 2010. Data was published for all billing authorities in England and Wales, including national and regional totals.

3. The publication of properties by band is the next release of an ongoing annual series showing the number of properties in each council tax band. This information was previously published by Communities and Local Government. The count of properties with each of the VOA's Property Attribute Codes is newly published as an official statistic. These statistics are published in compliance with the code of practice for official statistics set out in the Statistics and Registration Act 2007.

4. While the VOA aims to be as open and transparent as possible about the data it holds and continually looks for ways to improve the understanding of its work, it takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously. As an Executive Agency of HM Revenue & Customs, the VOA is subject to taxpayer confidentiality laws.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1777766,Nominate your Big Society champion,"The Prime Minister has launched the new Big Society awards to recognise some of the excellent work going on across the country.

Individuals, businesses, charities, community groups and other organisations are all eligible if they illustrate the Big Society in action. It's also an excellent opportunity for projects in the Big Society vanguard areas, currently working with DCLG to bust the bureaucratic barriers, to show how they are leading the way.

Over the past few months, the four vanguard areas across the country have been given dedicated support from civil servants to nurture their Big Society project - turning them from ideas to reality.

Their job is to remove the bureaucracy and red tape that impedes community action. Many similar barriers have been identified, including:

  * accessing the right information
  * navigating around the various Whitehall contacts and agencies
  * cultural barriers and perception problems in Whitehall

The Prime Minister said:

> ""There are some amazing projects and remarkable voluntary work going on in towns and cities up and down the country, by all kinds of organisations from large enterprises to tiny grassroots schemes and inspirational individuals.
> 
> ""These awards are a chance to pay tribute to those making a valuable contribution to their community, the real champions of the Big Society, but perhaps more importantly, I hope they will motivate many others to take action, get involved and drive change in their area.""

Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark added:

> ""There is no shortage of talented and passionate people out there who every day think 'I could do that better'. I believe they are right and it's these local innovators who need a government that actively supports them in their endeavours.
> 
> ""These awards are an excellent way of paying tribute to the inspirational work underway right on our doorsteps. The four vanguard areas are helping us understand and resolve the bureaucratic hurdles that get in the way of locally driven social action, essential to building the Big Society, so I hope the local champions will come forward as nominees.""

Individuals, businesses, charities, community groups and other organisations are all eligible if they illustrate the Big Society in action.

These might be:

  * people or groups who are bringing their community together and helping to give people more power to take decisions and shape their area;
  * people who are transforming our public services, staff setting up their own cooperatives, or new providers or frontline staff finding innovative ways to deliver better services to the public; or
  * people who are giving their time and money to help others, the unsung heroes changing lives in every neighbourhood of the country.

People will be able to submit nominations via a form on the Number 10 website (see link, top right). Nominees will then go through a selection process which will eventually involve a panel of previous winners and individuals from civil society organisations, government and the private sector.

Award winners will receive a certificate from the Prime Minister and will be invited to a regular Big Society Award Winners Reception at Downing Street.

The Awards kick of this week with the first winner, Central Surrey Health, a social enterprise providing community nursing and therapy services on behalf of NHS Surrey and other partners.

Further information can be seen on the Number 10 website (see link, top right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1848583,Norfolk flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Norfolk has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

The Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk, Richard Jewson, said:

> ""We are very proud that Norfolk follows the City of London in having its flag flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government. Norfolk is second to none when it comes to combining a strong county identity while being staunchly English. Norfolk always has a presence in the heart of London - it is a Norfolk man that stands atop Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square, honoured as this country's greatest naval hero.""

The Leader of Norfolk County Council, Derrick Murphy, said:

> ""It is fitting that one of England's great shire counties should follow the City of London in having its flag flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government. Norfolk is in its own way extraordinary, boasting a Royal residence at Sandringham, rich history and heritage, outstanding coast, countryside and waterways with the fine city of Norwich at its heart.""

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Leader of Northamptonshire County Council, Councillor Jim Harker said:

> ""We are immensely proud that the Northamptonshire flag is being flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government in London.
> 
> ""Our county lies at the very heart of England. From the main Roman highway of Watling Street, to the seat of numerous medieval parliaments at Northampton, to the decisive civil war battlefield of Naseby, to the home of the British Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone, it is consistently playing a major role in shaping the national history.
> 
> ""We will continue to ensure that our rich heritage plays a part in guiding the way as we face up to the challenges of the 21st Century.""

> ""Northumberland is one of England's most rural and northerly counties so we are delighted that the flag is being flown down in London. This is an imaginative way of celebrating the unique and rich heritage of both our country and county.""

The Venerable Bede, an early English historian, talks about a flag of purple and gold which hung over the tomb of St Oswald, the 7th century king of Northumbria. Later, in medieval times the colours of gold and red were adopted by the first Earl of Northumberland and these have remained the county colours ever since.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1735211,Olympic Park vision set to transform East London,"A regenerated East End boasting an Olympic Park fit for champions was described by the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) as they set out their ambitions for the years following the 2012 Olympic Games.

Plans include the development of five neighbourhoods based around the park, creating a total of 11,000 new homes, as well as a network of facilities, blending commercial opportunities, sporting venues and visitor attractions with the surrounding community.

The park itself will be renamed the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and will be the hub of a comprehensive redevelopment of the area.

Communities Minister Bob Neill welcomed the OPLC's vision for the Olympic Park alongside the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt and the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

Mr Neill said:

> ""This is an exciting time for the people of East London. They're already set to host the greatest games event in the world and the Olympic Park Legacy Company's new twenty year vision for the area means the future beyond 2012 is full of promise.
> 
> ""This vision has the potential to transform East London so that it grows and prospers with the rest of the capital. And we are committed to working with the OPLC and the Mayor to help meet this potential, bring in new business and nurture the vibrant heart of the local community.""

[![Olympics Minister joins local pupils to tackle the 2012 rapids](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6052/5909354984_93cf53ef2e_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/communitiesuk/5909354984/)

The only brand new London 2012 venue open to the public, the Centre brings white water rafting and canoeing to a huge new audience in London and the south east, with the Olympic Standard Course for the sporting elite and a smaller Legacy Loop to train and develop the next generation.

The Minister tackled the waves as part of the Lee Valley White Water Centre Schools Festival, where 1500 school children across London, Essex and Hertfordshire were given the chance to experience the Olympic Standard Competition Course for free a year before the Games begin.

Mr Neill said:

> ""The Lea Valley White Water Rafting Centre is a wonderful example of a world class facility designed for the sporting elite and local people alike.
> 
> ""I have seen just how seamlessly the centre blends sporting excellence and community use. I've enjoyed the thrilling rapids, taken in the luscious parkland and spoken with visiting children who are taking part in the day's events with great gusto.
> 
> ""The world, and posterity, will judge the legacy of the 2012 Olympics very simply: against the quality, and long term value, of the Legacy it leaves behind. This centre, and the other venues run by Lea Valley Regional Park Authority- the Lea Valley Hockey and Tennis Centres and the Velopark - are playing a hugely important role in bringing a meaningful and exciting legacy from the Olympic Games to the local community and beyond.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1930410,One week left to apply for enterprise zones that will make the UK best for growth,"Enterprise Zones can help make this country the best place in Europe to start and grow a business, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today, with just one week to go for second round bids to be submitted.

Enterprise Zones are a crucial element of the Government's ambition to make the UK a world leader for new business investment. The first 11 partnerships to get Enterprise Zones were announced in the Budget 2011 and the designated zones will get simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses to promote growth.

In a speech to the Institute of Directors today, Mr Pickles urged local enterprise partnerships yet to submit a bid, not to let their local area miss out on the competition for Enterprise Zone status and the local growth and prosperity this could bring about.

The competition for 10 further enterprise zones was announced in May 2011. Successful applicants have to show their prospective zone would have genuine potential to create the new business and jobs they need, with positive benefits across the wider economic area.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""There is a week to go before applications close for the second round to host Enterprise Zones. Bidders have no time to lose. Only the best will be get the go ahead and I want to see different areas put their very best ideas forward.  I'm delighted by the ambition that we've already seen coming through.
> 
> ""Enterprise Zones will transform 21 under-utilised parts of the country into hothouses for growth drawing in firms with simplified planning, super fast broadband and business rates discounts. Enterprise Zones can help make this country the best place in Europe to start and grow a business.""

John Rider, Chairman of the Institute of Directors West Midlands Region said:

> ""Getting councils to channel their energies into building a pro-business environment that will aid a private-sector led recovery is crucial. Enterprise Zones will show local government across the country that de-regulating, reducing tax and investing in key infrastructure brings significant long term benefits for business and local communities alike.
> 
> ""Over the coming months, the Institute of Directors will be calling on council leaders to develop stronger strategies for private sector growth in their communities and we very much hope Enterprise Zones will play their part in this process.""

Ministers believe that diverse local economies require different approaches that can't be imposed from the centre. The Government is determined to unlock the strengths and ingenuity of local businesses and civic leaders.

Local enterprise partnerships, which bring together local businesses and local councils have been invited to nominate specific sites for Enterprise Zone status, with specific plans to rejuvenate the local economy. Bids are expected to have the support of a range of local businesses - from large companies to small and medium enterprises.

The 11 local enterprise partnerships announced at the Budget 2011 as having an Enterprise Zone are making good progress on choosing their sites.

For example the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership has recently put forward Temple Quarter in Bristol as its proposed Enterprise Zone, while the Birmingham and Solihull partnership is looking at a zone in the city centre, focused around the new High Speed rail terminus.

When selecting the winners for the second wave, the Government will look at issues such as the choice of site; plans for development; targeting of sectors; and specific plans by local areas to remove barriers to business growth and reduce costs.

### Notes to editors

The first eleven vanguard Enterprise Zones were announced in the Budget 2011 and will be based within the following eleven local enterprise partnerships: Birmingham and Solihull, Sheffield City Region, Leeds City Region, Liverpool City Region, London, Greater Manchester, West of England, the Black Country, Derby and Nottingham, Tees Valley and the North East.

2. All Enterprise Zones will benefit from:

  * a business rate discount worth up to £275,000 per eligible business over a five year period

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1947092,One year on and vanguard communities instigate social change,"Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark, announced today that any citizen who wants to take social action and find community-led solutions to local needs will receive full support from Whitehall in the form of a dedicated barrier busting service.  

On the anniversary of the Prime Minister's launch of Big Society vanguards, Mr Clark was speaking at a 'reporting back' event at the House of Commons to hear the achievements of local communities over the past year, and what Government can learn about the challenges they have faced.

The Prime Minister described the vanguards as 'great training grounds for change'. In each vanguard the local community wanted to take action to improve their area - from devolving budgets to street-level, to developing local transport services, taking over local assets such as a pub, piloting open-source planning, delivering broadband to local communities or generating their own energy - but had been prevented from doing so by barriers. A year on, with a firm commitment from Government to help these communities and a dedicated team of civil servants helping them overcome obstacles or bureaucratic log-jam, many of these ideas have come to fruition.

Three vanguard areas, Eden Valley in Cumbria, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead and the London Borough of Sutton, have seen some exemplar community initiatives come to fruition. Some of their recent successes include:

  * the recent launch in Sutton of a Citizens' University scheme 'The U' - to help people develop skills and confidence to enable them to play a more active role in their community
  * the laying of the first brick on the community-run Crosby Ravensworth housing development in Eden Valley
  * the imminent announcement of the consortium that will run a CareBank scheme, a time credit based service that will encourage residents to volunteer or provide mutual support for those with unmet support needs in Windsor and Maidenhead.

Speaking at the Vanguards reporting back event Greg Clark said:

> ""The vanguards have achieved remarkable results in a year and learning from their experience we are inviting every citizen across the country to become a 'vanguard'. We will support them with a dedicated barrier busting service from Whitehall ready to help overcome hurdles.
> 
> ""Local communities in the vanguard areas have clearly demonstrated how with some government support they can develop ideas, find solutions to local issues and have a stronger say in how their local services are delivered. The process of working through barriers - both real and perceived - with these communities has highlighted some issues which continue to inform all our work across Government.""

Vanguard leads presenting at the report back event outlined their experiences on facilitating the Whitehall drive to pass more control to local communities.

Cllr David Burbage, Leader of the Council and the vanguard champion for Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead said:

> ""We have been privileged to be a vanguard authority, helping promote and develop the Big Society in our communities. From enhancing transparency, delivering incentive schemes and promoting volunteering in many ways, the impetus from the Prime Minister, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Cabinet Office and the rest of Whitehall has been valuable in spreading the message.""

Rory Stewart MP said:

> ""Eden Valley has proved that barrier busting works. An amazing amount has been achieved in the last twelve months. The passion, commitment and ideas from communities across the Eden Valley are the embodiment of Big Society, which is all about trusting people. It is not an anarchic dream, or a cover for cuts: it is a story of individuals, personalities, charisma. It is about listening to communities, who know more, care more and can do more than distant officials. We want to see other communities across Cumbria and across England benefiting from the real potential of the Big Society, which has been proven with such success right here in the Eden Valley.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1698504,Our streets shouldn't be an obstacle course,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has called for unnecessary signs, railings and bollards to be removed in a bid to make streets tidier and safer - saying ""We need to cut the clutter"".

Mr Pickles believes that many traffic signs and railings are put up in the mistaken belief that they are legally required. Although some signs are required by law, Government advice is that they are most effective when kept to a minimum.

![embed: ](http://www.youtube.com/v/338crEdi_FM?fs=1&showinfo=0;hl=en_GB&rel=0)

_A transcript is available to download below._

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Our streets are losing their English character. We are being overrun by scruffy signs, bossy bollards, patchwork paving and railed off roads wasting taxpayers' money that could be better spent on fixing potholes or keeping council tax down. We need to 'cut the clutter'.
> 
> ""Too many overly cautious townhall officials are citing safety regulations as the reason for cluttering up our streets with an obstacle course when the truth is very little is dictated by law. Common sense tells us uncluttered streets have a fresher, freer authentic feel, which are safer and easier to maintain.""
> 
> **Key Facts**   
Decluttering Kensington & Chelsea's High Street saw a 40% reduction in road traffic accidents and a 60% reduction in pedestrian accidents.

### Councils urged to cut the clutter

Councils have been urged to get rid of unnecessary clutter in a bid to make streets tidier and less confusing for motorists and pedestrians.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Philip Hammond are concerned that the character of the country's urban spaces is being damaged and have today written to councils leaders.

Philip Hammond said:

> ""We all know that some signs are necessary to make our roads safe and help traffic flow freely. But unnecessary street furniture is a waste of taxpayers' money and leaves our streets looking more like scrap yards than public spaces.
> 
> ""We have written to councils to remind them that it need not be this way - we don't need all this clutter confusing motorists, obstructing pedestrians and hindering those with disabilities who are trying to navigate our streets.""

### Big Society solution

Mr Pickles wants communities to tell councils about particularly bad examples of clutter as part of the Big Society in action. Organisations like Civic Voice, Living Streets and fixmystreet.com are already helping people alert councils to examples of clutter and showing people how to carry out street audits.

Mr Pickles added:

> ""Organisations like Civic Voice, Living Streets and fixmystreet can help councils provide a Big Society solution - local people carrying out street audits will bring power and character back to neighbourhoods.""

The Salisbury Civic Society concluded, after carrying out a survey of over 60 streets, that it has become cluttered over time markedly reducing its character. They found the city centre was littered with hundreds of bollards including one parking area for 53 cars had 63 bollards.

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice, said:

> ""Too many streets are plagued with pointless clutter, blighting the local environment and people's lives. With today's welcome backing from the Government we should reclaim our streets and see them cleared of clutter.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2077107,Over 150 councils already pledging to freeze or cut Council Tax,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today praised councils that have already signalled they intend to help hard pressed families cope with the cost of living by signing up to the Government's council tax freeze offer.

With over a month to go until final budget decisions are taken, press reports have shown that 152 councils in England are preparing to freeze or reduce council tax next year. Councils which have indicated they are going further and cutting council tax in cash terms include Hammersmith and Fulham, South Oxfordshire, Stratford-on-Avon, Tendring and Windsor and Maidenhead.

Council tax bills more than doubled since 1997 until last year's freeze. This is the second year the Government has offered support to freeze council tax to support local residents, families and pensioners.

The Government has set aside up to £675 million for local authorities in England to help keep council tax down. Last year's freeze saved households up to an estimated £72 on a Band D bill, and this year's freeze could potentially do the same.

This new support builds on the offer taken up by all councils last year boosting what they could get over four years to £3.3 billion if they hold council tax for a second year.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""I would like to congratulate the 150 or so local authorities, which have already signalled their intent to freeze or cut council tax this year.
> 
> ""This will be welcome news for many council taxpayers who've seen their bills double since 1997.
> 
> ""It is very early in the budget setting process, and I would fully expect this number to increase significantly over the next few weeks.
> 
> ""Every councillor still to decide has an obligation to keep the living costs of their residents down and take the freeze money. A vote against a freeze is a vote for a punitive tax-rise when typical bill are already around £120 a month.""

### Notes to editors

1. The list of councils that have signalled their intention to take part in the Government's 2012-13 £675 million council tax freeze initiative as of 25 January 2012 is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/pdf/2077094.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/pdf/2077094.pdf) (PDF, 38kb) .

2. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. This year, 2011-12, the average Band D bill set by local authorities remained at £1,439. In London it was £1,308; in metropolitan areas it was £1,399; and in shire areas it was £1,484. Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double.

3. The value of saving for taxpayers by area from two years of the council tax freeze scheme compared to a five per cent rise can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls) (Excel, 63kb).

4. Local authorities who do not put up their council tax will receive a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax income. The freeze means local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £72. More details on how the council tax freeze scheme works: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf) (PDF, 32kb).

5. The Localism Act abolishes Whitehall capping in England and puts local referendums in its place. This gives the public the right to veto excessive council tax rises. Councils that set council tax increase above a ceiling approved by Parliament each year would automatically trigger a referendum of all registered local electors in their area. This year the proposed new 'local tax lock' allows people a vote to stop council tax going up if their local authority refuses to freeze bills and hike the tax by more than 3.5 per cent. Parliament will be asked to endorse the final vote threshold before councils set their annual budgets in the spring.

6. The Government's provisional funding settlement for English local authorities next financial year will mean councils have an average spending power of £2,186 per household at their disposal. £27.8 billion will be distributed in 2012-13 in a fair and sustainable way across all parts of the country - rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. It will give more weight to areas with the highest levels of assessed need. For example, the average spending power per household in Hackney will be £3,050 compared with £1,537 in Windsor and Maidenhead reflecting the fairness of the settlement. Overall the average spending power reduction for councils in 2012-13 is expected to be limited to just 3.3 per cent or £75 per household, less than last year's comparable figure of 4.5 per cent.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2122232,Over 180 bids to improve or reinstate weekly rubbish collections,"A groundswell of councils want to take up the Government's £250 million offer to support better, more frequent, more environmentally friendly bin collections for residents, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles revealed today.

Over 180 potential bids have been sent in, surpassing expectations. Nearly two-thirds came from authorities that want to retain or reinstate weekly collections to offer more comprehensive collections of residual waste and recycling for their residents.

A number of bids are proposing to use the funding to invest in new infrastructure or technology to improve services or increase recycling. Others focus on better services like tackling 'bin blight' by reducing bin numbers or tailoring collections for specific neighbourhoods.

Ministers believe waste services have become too complex. In the past, councils had been actively encouraged to make cuts to services instead of improving value for money through better procurement, technology and incentives. In February 2012, the Government launched a new fund of up to £250 million Weekly Collection Support Scheme to help councils retain or reinstate weekly waste and recycling services.

The fund will also promote innovation, better procurement and joint working across local authorities supporting initiatives to increase recycling and deliver weekly collections. This will deliver benefits to the environment and taxpayers.

Government will now be working with councils to make sure quality outline bids are submitted by the May deadline. The scoring system will reward bids that support comprehensive weekly rubbish and recycling collections.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Rubbish collections are the most visible service that people get for their £120 a month council tax bill. The public are fed up of all the bin do's and bin don'ts - now our fund will mean councils can sort out their service and offer a high quality weekly collection or invest in ways to improve recycling through incentives and new technology.
> 
> ""I'm pleased to see so many councils come forward to stop the rot. This shows councils recognise more can be done to increase the sustainability, frequency and the quality of rubbish collections people get in return for their council tax.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Weekly Collection Support Scheme was launched on 3 February 2012. The fund encourages councils to focus on three things: better weekly collections, better contracts and better use of innovative ideas or technology that help residents to recycle more and do their bit for the environment. The prospectus Supporting Weekly Collections explains how councils should apply. Councils hoping to be eligible for a slice of the funding should submit their outline bid by 11 May 2012.

2. The Scheme follows on from the Government's announcement as part of the Waste Review in June last year to introduce a series of measures to make life easier for the householder. It has already scrapped plans to introduce new bin taxes with provisions through the Localism Act; reversed Audit Commission guidance and inspections which marked down councils who do not adopt fortnightly rubbish collections; and abolished Local Area Agreements imposed by Whitehall which created perverse incentives to downgrade waste collection services.

3. The fund will inject up to £250 million into projects that will help to improve local waste and recycling services, develop infrastructure, and reward recycling (for example, building on examples like Windsor and Maidenhead's Recyclebank scheme and Birmingham's Nectar points scheme).

4. The Government has committed to reducing waste and accelerating recycling rates by focusing on rewards incentives that encourage recycling. More details can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1608336](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1608336). A Government scheme to encourage councils and other organisations to test out innovative reward and recognition schemes is now in place: [www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/consumer/reward-scheme/](http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/consumer/reward-scheme/) (external link).

5. The Government has recently consulted on measures to stop councils imposing unfair 'bin fines' of up to £1,000 on households for breaches of confusing bin rules. The consultation, promised in the Waste Review, can be viewed here: [www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/01/16/bin-fines-consultation](http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/01/16/bin-fines-consultation/) (external link). A Government response is expected shortly.

6. A recent Sauce-Icaro Attitudes to Waste Survey found that two-thirds (67 per cent) agreed with the statement the Government should mandate weekly collections. Weekly collections had higher satisfaction levels than fortnightly (83-74 per cent). Reports of problems with flies and smells for fortnightly collections was more than double that for weekly (14 per cent - 6 per cent).

7. The average Band D council tax bill in England is £1,444 a year (an average of £120 a month).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1768224,Over-confident 'Generation Super Gran' dismisses risk of home fire,"Over-65s are putting their lives at risk when it comes to the life threatening danger of a fire in the home, with almost 80 per cent dismissing the possibility of fire.

Dubbed 'Generation Super-Gran', England's over 65s are more active and independent than ever, with role models such as Felicity Kendal, Helen Mirren and Joanna Lumley. However, while tradition teaches that the older we are, the wiser we become, a younger generation are outstripping their elders when it comes to fire safety.

Despite the fact that over half of all the people killed in an accidental fire in the home are aged 65 or over1, the vast majority don't consider fire a risk. On top of that, a massive 90 per cent overestimate their ability to escape.

In comparison 25 to 35 year olds are much more conscious of the need to plan an escape route - only six out of ten thinking they'd realise there was a fire and be able to escape.

The Fire Kills Campaign is reminding over 65s that they're not invulnerable to the danger of toxic smoke and asking them to become more fire-aware.

  * 79 per cent think it's unlikely there will be a life threatening fire in their home2, yet nearly 1,700 people in this age group suffer fire-related injuries each year.3
  * Half think it's unlikely they would die if there was a fire.4
  * Nine out of ten think they'd realise if there was a fire in their home and be able to escape.5
  * A quarter don't think it's necessary to test their smoke alarm every week.6

Sir Ken Knight, the Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser:

> ""What many people over the age of 65 don't realise is that just two to three breaths of toxic smoke could leave you unconscious. You have less than two minutes to escape in a fire before your lungs fill up with smoke and you can't breathe - so it's vital that as well as having a working smoke alarm, an escape route is planned and practiced, especially as you get older, it will take more time to evacuate your home safely.""

Judy Moore, who sadly lost her father in a domestic fire said:

> ""There is nothing more devastating than losing a loved one in a fire. The fire was caused by an old-fashioned blow heater, and at the time my father was sleeping and unaware of what was happening. A working smoke alarm may have made all the difference, the sound of the alarm could have woken him up and given him those valuable few minutes to escape. I know the distress a fire can cause and would not want anyone to experience the same. I now ensure all my family, including my two grand daughters in their new homes, are doing all we can to prepare for and prevent fires.""

Michelle Mitchell, Age UK's Charity Director adds:

> ""It's shocking to hear that people over the age of 65 are more likely to die in a fire in their own home, compared to someone who is younger. It's therefore vital that we all take the steps to make sure we are doing what we can to prevent this from happening. Planning your escape route now, as well as testing your smoke alarm every week to check it works, are two important steps. If you are unable to test your own alarm, ask a family member or neighbour to do so for you. You can also contact your local fire and rescue service to ask for an expert to come out to your home to look for any potential fire hazards and help you with your escape route.""

The Fire Kills campaign provides the following tips on how to make sure you can escape safely in a house fire:

  * Make sure you have a working smoke alarm and you test this once a week
  * Preparing and practicing a plan of action will help you act quickly if there's a fire in your home - it could even save your life.
  * Make sure you've chosen your escape route and think of any difficulties you may have getting out and help you may need, such as a torch to light your way or a stair rail.
  * Consider a place to go if you can't escape, especially if you have trouble moving around or can't get downstairs on your own.
  * Make sure everyone knows where the door and window keys are kept.
  * You could even write out a step-by-step escape plan and leave it somewhere safe so can you have it to hand if needed.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2054429,Overhaul of town hall funding hands councils the means to boost finances,"Councils will be freed to generate greater levels of income, encouraged to support local firms and jobs and be well placed to reap the rewards of success, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today, as he confirmed that Government will introduce major reforms enabling councils to keep a share of business rates they collect rather than paying them back to Whitehall.

Ministers are committed to letting councils benefit from business rates growth in their areas and borrow against future rate income. They see this as the means to putting all parts of the country on a surer path to economic growth and, following consultation, have today set out further detail on how the changes will be introduced.

Last year £19 billion in business rates collected by councils were recovered by Government and redistributed back out through a complex grant. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) called this one of the most centralised systems in the world.

Ministers believe that the new business rates system will not only be more transparent but by introducing a new incentive for councils to work with business in their areas and grow their economies, will increase the amount of revenue they generate from business rates and provide confidence that they will receive their fair share of that revenue.

The reforms will establish a direct link between the effort that councils put into growing local economies, supporting jobs and infrastructure and the amount of money that they have to spend on local services and local people.

Council tax payers and business rate payers stand to benefit from additional income that rate retention could bring authorities, through better services and more investment.

The Government is not proposing to change the way that business rates bills are calculated, the way that properties are valued or the way business rates levels are set. National discounts and rate relief will continue to be supported meaning there will be no adverse change to such groups as charities, amateur sports clubs, voluntary groups, those in hardship and eligible rural or small firms.

Ministers are clear that helping small shops and businesses grow is a crucial part of rebalancing and rebuilding the economy. To that end, the Government has doubled small business rate relief helping half a million small firms for two years, scrapped red tape making it easier for small shops to reapply for discounts and has given councils powers to set local business rate discounts. Ministers are also committed to supporting local high streets though policies such as town centre first and are currently considering recommendations from the recent Mary Portas high street review. 

The Government will today introduce legislation to devolve greater financial powers and freedoms to councils. The Local Government Finance Bill will set out the legislative foundations to implement changes from April 2013.

In developing the proposed reforms the Government has taken steps to ensure that the interests of the vulnerable and local taxpayers are protected, that the changes are fair to all councils and will encourage growth.  
                              
Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""We need to restore the country to strong sustainable growth and Local Government has a key part to play in this. For too long councils have been hamstrung and discouraged by a system that failed to encourage and reward economic success.
> 
> ""This isn't simply about redistributing the proceeds of growth.  If these reforms lead to every council working as hard as it possibly can to help businesses thrive, then they have the potential to benefit individually and increase growth overall.  It's good news for communities - growth in business rates means more money to invest in local services.  And it's good news for local businesses, who can look forward to an even stronger partnership with councils.
> 
> ""Our reforms are fair and sustainable. They will deliver long term certainty and protection for those areas in need of additional support.""

The reforms being announced today include measures to:

  * enable councils to directly retain a portion of their business rate growth

  * introduce tax increment financing giving councils freedom to borrow against future income from business rates to pay for roads and transport projects alongside other local priorities

  * ensure a stable starting point for all authorities. No authority will be worse off as a result of their business rates base at the start of the scheme

  * establish a national baseline alongside a system of top ups and tariffs. Councils with business rates in excess of a set baseline would pay a tariff to government whilst those below would get an individually assessed top up from government. This would ensure that all councils would start from a level playing field. How far they then progressed beyond that would be entirely down to them

  * create a levy to take back a share of growth from those councils that gain disproportionately from the changes. This money would be used to fund a safety net providing financial help to those authorities who experience significant drops in business rates, for example caused by the closure or relocation of a major business.

The changes to the way in which councils are financed should be seen in the context of wider reforms designed to support local growth. Local government will have access to new financial measures including over £430 million of funding under New Homes Bonus, up to a £1 billion in Community Infrastructure Levy, access to the £2.4 billion Regional Growth Fund and the £500 million Growing Places Fund (through their Local Enterprise Partnerships).

The reforms should also be considered alongside changes to give councils greater financial autonomy - for example putting councils in charge of providing financial support for council tax. This reform will enable expenditure on council tax support to be reduced by over £400m a year in England, will give local authorities a greater financial stake in getting people back into work, and ensure that vulnerable pensioners continue to receive support. The Local Government Finance Bill includes measures to introduce localised schemes in England from 2013-14.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The reforms we are delivering to the way support for council tax is provided will mean councils are much better placed to help their residents get off welfare and reap the benefits of work instead. They will directly benefit from improving the prosperity of the local area that will in turn drive down their benefit bill.
> 
> ""The reforms go hand in hand with wider economic reforms and will mean the new system will be a fairer one, where tax payers can be more confident that spiralling benefits bill are controlled and where work pays.""

### Notes to editors

1. Proposals for a new business rates retention scheme were first published for consultation in July 2011. The proposals were based on four key principles:

  * to build into the local government finance system an incentive for local authorities to promote local growth over the long term

  * to reduce local authorities' dependency upon central government, by producing as many self sufficient authorities as possible

  * to maintain a degree of redistribution of resources to ensure that authorities with high need and low tax bases are still able to meet the needs of their areas; and

  * protection for businesses and specifically, no increases in locally-imposed taxation without the agreement of local businesses.

2. A plain English guide to the core components of the rate retention scheme was published alongside the consultation and is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/resourcereviewplainenglish](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/resourcereviewplainenglishres)

3. The Government has today published its response to that consultation setting out a clear central proposition for the business rate scheme [www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/lgresourcereview/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localgovernmentfinance/lgresourcereview/). This document provides further detail on how the scheme will operate and next steps on delivering reform.

4. The Government will today introduce into the House of Commons The Local Government Finance Bill which will make it possible for local authorities to retain business rates and will set out, in legislation, the structure of the business rates scheme.

5. The Local Government Finance Bill will contain provisions for the establishment of localised council tax support schemes in England. The Government has today published its response to the consultation on the localisation of support for council tax in England [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localisingtaxresponse](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localisingtaxresponse). The detail of the framework for local schemes will be set out in regulations, which the Government intends to publish in draft form for consultation while the Bill is in passage through Parliament. The Department for Communities and Local Government will also continue to engage with local authorities to support their work in preparing for the introduction of local schemes.  
   
6. The Bill will also provide for a number of technical reforms to council tax, including powers to reduce certain discounts and exemptions. Government has proposed a series of practical proposals which will help hard-working families and pensioners with their council tax bills. The reforms could allow councils to make up to a £20 reduction in the bill for a typical Band D property in England. These proposals are subject to consultation and the Government will if necessary introduce amendments to the Bill in line with final policy decisions.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Tim Stevenson OBE, Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire said:

> ""Oxfordshire is a county famous for its University and its science and technology industries and car-making on the one hand and for Winston Churchill, Blenheim Palace and a fair share of the Cotswolds and the Chilterns on the other.
> 
> ""We are the most rural county in the South East but we have made and will continue to make a real contribution to English and British life. The fair people of Abingdon, Banbury, Bicester, Chipping Norton, Didcot, Henley, Oxford, Thame, Wantage and Witney and all points between are proud to have their county flag flying at the Department for Communities and Local Government.""

Councillor Keith Mitchell, Leader of Oxfordshire County Council, said:

> ""I am proud that our county flag will be flying at the Department for Communities and Local Government in London. I am an Englishman who is proud of his country - and this nation's network of counties is integral to what being English is all about.
> 
> ""Our contribution to the region and the capital's status as the engine of the UK economy is important to us here in this ancient yet modern shire.""

### Notes to editors

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2126286,Parish power to pray reinstated in time for Easter,"As Easter weekend approaches Parish Councils across England, including Bideford Town Council, have been handed a new power to continue to hold prayers as part of their formal business, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

In February 2012, the High Court ruled against Bideford Town Council, maintaining that it was illegal for councils to continue with the long-standing practice of holding prayers at the beginning of their meetings. This judgment was based on an interpretation of Section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972.

In response, Eric Pickles fast-tracked the introduction of the new general power of competence for (principal) local authorities in England. Amongst other things, this new power enables councils to continue to include prayers as part of the formal business at council meetings, if they wish.

Following approval in both houses of Parliament, the power to include prayers has now been extended to town and parish councils, like Bideford, that meet the criteria.

This builds on the speech by the Prime Minister in Christ Church, Oxford, in December 2011, where he asserted:

> ""We are a Christian country and we should not be afraid to say so.""

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Parliament has been clear that councils should have greater freedom from central interference. These new powers let councils innovate and also hands them back the freedom to pray.
> 
> ""Bideford Town Council will be able to hold prayers once more at the start of council business. With Easter approaching, this sends a strong signal that this Government will protect the role of faith in public life against aggressive secularism.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Coalition Government's Localism Act 2011 contains a 'general power of competence' that will allow councils to innovate and legally do anything an individual could do unless specifically prohibited by law. This should give councils that want to continue holding formal prayers the confidence and legal standing to do so. It gives councils more freedom to work together act creatively and innovatively to improve services, drive down costs and enhance their local area. Councils have asked for this power because it will help them get on with the job. It does not remove any duties from local authorities - just like individuals they will continue to need to comply with duties placed on them.

2. The implementation of the Parish Councils (General Power of Competence) (Prescribed Conditions) Order 2012 allows for parish councils that have a trained clerk and where two thirds of their members had been elected to resolve to use the general power of competence at any full council meeting. These conditions are intended to ensure that councillors seek proper advice before using the power and ensure a democratic mandate for the members actions. It is expected that every parish council will be able meet these basic eligibility requirements. Ministers are now considering what further steps can be taken to help the smaller parish meetings and parish councils who will not have the general power of competence.

4. Wider powers for English Fire and Rescue Authorities, Integrated Transport Authorities, Passenger Transport Executives Combined Authorities and Economic Prosperity Boards came into effect on 18 February 2012. The Welsh Assembly Government has decided that Welsh fire and rescue authorities will not have access to the power until April 2012.

The appointment was confirmed by Downing Street. Sir Bob, who joined the Department a year ago, will take on his new responsibilities alongside his existing role after Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell retires at the end of the year.

As previously announced, Sir Gus's responsibilities will be separated out after he steps down, with Jeremy Heywood - currently Permanent Secretary at Number 10 - set to take over as the new Cabinet Secretary.

Before taking over the top job at DCLG, Sir Bob served as the first chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency. He has also served as chief executive of Sheffield City Council.

Commenting on the news, Sir Bob said:

> ""I am delighted and honoured to be given this leadership role at such an important time for the Civil Service. We have immense strengths in the service that we should be justly proud of, but we must also embrace change. I want to engage all parts of the Civil Service in the reform process.""

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

> ""I am delighted to announce that Sir Bob Kerslake will become Head of the Civil Service in January, working alongside Jeremy Heywood as Cabinet Secretary. Sir Bob brings with him a wealth of experience in both central and local government, gained from over 20 years of public service. This is a time of significant change and challenge for the Civil Service - driven by the demands for new skills and capabilities, and the delivery of substantial financial savings without compromising on standards. I feel absolutely confident that Bob and Jeremy will provide the leadership to ensure that our Civil Service continues to be admired around the world for its strength and professionalism.""

",21-May-10,,,,,eric-pickles,,,,
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1812648,Pickles acts to protect the rights of homeowners,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is today bringing an end to heavy handed rules that can mean people who leave their house empty for more than six months risk having it seized by their local authority.

In 2006, the previous Government introduced 'Empty Dwelling Management Orders'. They allow councils to take over properties that have been empty for as little as six months.

  * the home does not have to be blighted or boarded up to be taken over, just empty for six months - including homes of the deceased
  * councils have the right to seize furniture, fixtures and fittings, when the home is taken over, including where the home has been left empty for a period after the owner has died
  * homes already on the property market can be seized if councils believe the asking price is ""unrealistic"".

In order to protect civil liberties, Mr Pickles is today introducing powerful safeguards to restrict the use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders.

  * they will be limited to empty properties that have become magnets for vandalism, squatters and other forms of anti-social behaviour - blighting the local neighbourhood
  * a property will have to stand empty for at least two years before an Empty Dwelling Management Order can be obtained, and property owners will have to be given at least three months' notice before the order can be issued.

Mr Pickles is concerned that councils have used the Orders to instigate action against homeowners that is inappropriate, including against people in vulnerable situations. Councils have, for example, attempted to use the powers against a homeowner whilst she was caring for her injured daughter in France; to take over an Order being used against the house of a 96 year old as soon as he passed away in a nursing home; and against a divorcee, who faced action because he only lived in the property at weekends to visit his estranged children.

These new safeguards will ensure that responsible homeowners do not face having their properties seized. Mr Pickles said it is wrong that a bereaved family could face having their loved one's home seized for a period if there is a delay in them deciding what to do with it.

The move comes as the Government prepares to introduce wider plans to bring back into use many of the 300,000 properties in England that have been empty for a long period of time.

From next year, councils will have a new incentive to bring empty properties back into use through a New Homes Bonus, under which the Government will match the council tax raised from any council tax collected from a property that previously stood empty.

Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""There is a case for action to put boarded-up and blighted properties back into use. But these draconian and heavy-handed state powers have allowed councils to seize private homes in perfect condition, including their fixtures and fittings, just because the homes have been empty for a short while.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is standing up for the civil liberties of law-abiding citizens. Fundamental human rights include the right to property. People suffering the loss of a loved one should not have to endure the added indignity of having their home seized because of a delay in them deciding what to do with it.
> 
> ""That's why the new Government is introducing new safeguards that mean the rights of responsible homeowners will be protected, while allowing action to be taken against genuine derelict buildings which blight neighbourhoods.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Government will use secondary legislation to introduce safeguards that restrict the use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders 2006, and will be engaging with interested parties on the extent of the changes.

2. In 2006, the previous Government introduced new 'Empty Dwelling Management Orders' (EDMO) that give town halls the power to take over the management of private homes which have been empty for as little as six months.

  * There are two types of EDMO - an interim EDMO which lasts for a year during which time the local authority must try to work with the owner to get the property back into use. If no agreement is reached the local authority can make a final EDMO which can last for up to seven years.

  * The home does not have to be run down or uninhabitable to be seized, merely empty for six months.

  * Homes of the deceased can be confiscated for up to seven years, even if inheritance issues are not yet finalised. The regulations allow for the home of a deceased person to be seized at any point after six months from the 'grant of representation' (the proof of legal authority allowing a personal representative to start administering an estate).

  * The council is not obliged to obtain a market rent, but in most cases can still deduct all their running costs from the rent.

  * Tenants in the home still have contractual and legal rights of occupancy, making it more difficult to return the property to the owner if the Order is revoked.

3. In guidance issued in 2009, the previous Government called for local authorities to make use of these powers. The guidance can be found at [http://www.emptyhomes.com/usefulresources/edmos.html](http://www.emptyhomes.com/usefulresources/edmos.html).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1809347,Pickles and Hammond to end the war on motorists,"Parking space limits for new homes and higher parking charges guidance scrapped

Limits on car spaces for new homes and guidance encouraging higher parking charges are being abolished ending the war on motorists, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles and Transport Secretary Philip Hammond announced today.

Ministers are today removing national planning restrictions put in place in 2001 that required councils to limit the number of parking spaces allowed in new residential developments and set high parking charges to encourage the use of alternative modes of transport.

The Government believes these rules unfairly penalised drivers, led to over-zealous parking enforcement, and increased unsightly on-street parking congestion - putting the safety of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians at risk.

From now on, councils and communities will be free to set parking policies that are right for their areas. This could include taking into account the effect of parking charges on the vitality of their local economy and local shops. Councils wanting to attract shoppers through setting competitive local parking charges in town centres will now be able to do so without interference from Whitehall.

The Government has also announced it wants councils to promote electric vehicle charging points in new developments to encourage more green drivers, without making developments unaffordable. As part of this Ministers have announced their intention to allow charging points to be built on streets and in outdoor car parks without the need for planning permission.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Whitehall's addiction to micromanagement has created a parking nightmare with stressed-out drivers running a gauntlet of unfair fines, soaring charges and a total lack of residential parking. The result is our pavements and verges crammed with cars on kerbs endangering drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, increased public resentment of over- zealous parking wardens and escalating charges and fines.
> 
> ""Today the Government is calling off Whitehall's war on the motorist by scrapping the national policy restricting residential parking spaces and instructing councils to push up charges. We expect councils to follow suit. From now on communities have the freedom to set competitive local charges that bring shoppers to the high street, proportionate enforcement and the right number of spaces for new development. We're getting out of the way and it's up to councils to set the right parking policy for their area.""

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said:

> ""This is a key step in ending the war on the motorist. For years politicians peddled the pessimistic, outdated attitude that they could only cut carbon emissions by forcing people out of their cars.
> 
> ""But this Government recognises that cars are a lifeline for many people - and that by supporting the next generation of electric and ultra-low emission vehicles, it can enable sustainable green motoring to be a long-term part of Britain's future transport planning.""

Parking problems on new developments can cause knock-on effects to surrounding neighbourhoods. Spill-over creates street congestion that can cause blind spots for pedestrians, hinder emergency vehicles and lead to fly parking.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark added:

> ""Limiting the number of drives and garages in new homes doesn't make cars disappear - it just clogs residential roads with parked cars and makes drivers cruise the streets hunting for a precious parking space. That's why I'm pleased today to get rid of another daft, interfering rule that has only succeeded in annoying people.""

### Notes to Editors

  1. _Planning Policy Guidance 13: Transport (PPG13)_, in conjunction with _Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing (PPS3)_, sets out the need for Local Councils to use maximum parking standards for residential development. By ending this requirement Councils will have the freedom to decide how many parking spaces they want to see in new development in their area. The new rules will ensure local authorities can choose what sort of new housing developments they want in their communities, rather than having homes where the choice on parking provision has been restricted by central government.
  2. Ministers also believe that Government should not tell local authorities how they should set parking charges. The policy to set parking charges to encourage the use of alternative forms of transport was also contained in PPG13, and has now been deleted. Local authorities will have the freedom to set parking charges to take account of the needs of their communities.
  3. The Department for Transport's Operational Guidance on _Parking Policy and Enforcement_ maintains that charges should not be used to raise revenue or as a local tax and an authority is likely to be acting unlawfully if it were to do so.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1592737,Pickles and Shapps announce HIPs are history,"![Eric Pickles, Kirsty Allsop and Grant Shapps cutting housing market red tape](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1592620.jpg)Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Housing Minister Grant Shapps have announced that, with immediate effect, Home Information Packs (HIPs) are suspended.

_Location, Location, Location_ presenter Kirstie Allsopp joined Mr Pickles and Mr Shapps on a visit to an estate agents in Battersea, London today to hear how the suspension of HIPs will help the fragile housing market. 

### Less cost and less hassle

Mr Pickles said that the suspension will show those thinking of selling their home that they can put it on the market with less cost and less hassle.

HIPs will no longer hold back the housing market by forcing sellers to fork out extra cash, sometimes hundreds of pounds, just to be able to put their home up for sale.

Mr Pickles and Mr Shapps also confirmed that in order to help people reduce their energy bills and tackle climate change, sellers will still be required to produce an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) when they sell their home.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The expensive and unnecessary Home Information Pack has increased the cost and hassle of selling homes and is stifling a fragile housing market.
> 
> ""HIPs are history. This action will encourage sellers back into the market, and help the market as a whole and the economy recover.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This is a great example of how this new Government is getting straight down to work by cutting away pointless red-tape that is strangling the market.
> 
> ""Rather than shelling out hundreds of pounds for nothing in return we're stripping away bureaucracy and letting home owners sell their properties.""

Kirsty Allsop said:

> ""I work with people buying and selling their houses every day and I've seen genuine unhappiness. Today's the day that HIPs are gone. You will not have to pay £250, or £350 plus VAT, for a piece of paper that no one will look at and will not reduce your lawyer's fees.""

### Impact of HIPs suspension

Following on from the Secretary of State Eric Pickles' and Housing Minister Grant Shapps' suspension of Home Information Packs, Estate Agents have suggested an increase in housing market activity (see links to some of the media coverage on the right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1964311,Pickles announces multi-million pound support package for local firms and families to rebuild their communities,"Residents and local firms affected by the riots are in line for financial support from central government, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today as he outlined a package of measures that will help communities to get back on their feet.

The one-off measures are part of concerted, cross-Government action to help rebuild communities, open up shops and rebuild buildings which were damaged, make sure people who lost their homes are re-housed, and to help councils get their areas back to normal as quickly as possible.

Mr Pickles also sent a clear message that the Government stands fully behind councils seeking to evict tenants that are found to have taken part in the looting and rioting across the country over the last few days - this will send a strong message that crime does not pay.

The package of support being announced today includes:

  * **A £10m recovery fund** to help councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe, clear and clean again. This fund can be used, for example, to clear debris left strewn in streets and make immediate repairs to pavements and roads. This Recovery scheme can also be used to support councils who use their powers to offer council tax discounts or **council tax relief** to those whose homes have been damaged but are still habitable.
  * **A £20m High Street Support Scheme** - funded jointly by the Departments for Communities and Local Government, and Business Innovation and Skills, which will be made available immediately, for the streets and areas where businesses were affected by the rioting. The money is intended to finance those measures that will get business trading again and meet short term costs. Councils will distribute the money and could use it to reduce business rates, finance building repairs and encourage customers back to the affected areas.
  * In addition, seriously damaged homes and business properties will be taken off the respective valuation lists, and Mr Pickles has strongly encouraged the Valuation Office Agency and local authorities to do so as promptly as possible. This **removes any liability for council tax or business rates**.
  * Councils have the power to offer **rate relief for local firms**, but must pay a quarter of the cost; central government automatically pays for three quarters of the cost. The High Street Support Scheme will help reimburse councils for this cost, to facilitate immediate and real financial help to be given to small and medium firms to rebuild their local businesses. Business rates are typically the third biggest outgoing for firms after rent and staff.
  * **Re-housing funding** to meet the immediate costs of emergency accommodation for families who have been made homeless by the disturbances. As these are exceptional circumstances, Mr Pickles has confirmed that his Department would meet these costs under established homelessness funding processes.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Our priority is to get local communities back on their feet, get businesses up and running again and make sure nobody is left without a roof over their head. We will stand side by side with communities as they rebuild their lives.
> 
> ""We are making immediate financial support available to those that need help and we will continue to work closely with councils who have already responded to this violence with calm, resolve and professionalism.
> 
> ""It is not just for the state to support local firms affected by these criminal actions. I encourage every local resident to make an effort to shop locally in this and coming weeks and support the local high streets which are the lifeblood of our communities.""

In a written statement to Parliament, Mr Pickles also praised the efforts of Fire and Rescue Services who had been working hard to contain fires caused by those intent on destruction. Fire-fighters braved threats, and in some cases injury, in order to safeguard people and property across the country.

The Government has been absolutely clear that those who have committed criminal acts will be found and punished. Mr Pickles reinforced this stance today by announcing that councils will have the Government's full backing in holding any rioters living in social housing to account.

The Communities Secretary pledged the Government will support councils seeking to evict tenants involved in unrest, both in their communities and further afield, and will be urgently looking at all options to strengthen the powers councils have to take action in response to the behaviour of their tenants.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""The people who rioted and looted over the past few days need to know that there are consequences to their actions. So they should wake up and listen to this clear message: if you live in a social home and you are caught rioting, your one night of madness could have disastrous consequences for the rest of your lives.
> 
> ""Social housing is a precious resource, and the hard working taxpayers who subsidise it will be rightly wondering why anyone involved in trashing and looting our country should expect to enjoy the benefits of a social home.
> 
> ""Councils and housing associations already have powers to evict social tenants, if they are involved in anti-social behaviour or criminal activity. I urge them to consider using those powers. I am proposing to strengthen the powers so that tenants can be evicted for serious anti-social behaviour or criminal activity beyond their local neighbourhood. We've also recently announced that landlords, for the first time, will be able to use a fast-track eviction process where there's a previous conviction for a serious offence. So rioters beware - our country will be restored, but the stain on your record will remain, and could count against you in years to come.""

### Notes to editors

1. The DCLG written ministerial statement is available at: [www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/publicdisorder](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/publicdisorder).

2. Full details of the schemes will be announced within the next week. Councils should be able to make claims quickly, within the coming weeks, and will receive funding through a direct grant.

3. It is already a ground for eviction in existing legislation if a social tenant or a member of their family is involved in anti-social behaviour or criminal activity in their local neighbourhood. The Department is currently consulting on proposals to strengthen those powers so that landlords will be able to move decisively and quickly to evict anti-social tenants in cases of serious and persistent anti-social behaviour. We now propose to make the necessary changes to legislation so that landlords will have the power to evict tenants who engage in serious anti-social behaviour or criminal activity such as rioting beyond the local neighbourhood. We intend to consult on this proposal immediately as part of the ongoing consultation on anti-social behaviour.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1618444,Pickles calls time on town hall quango forcing councils into bin cuts,"Taxpayers deserve decent services - rather than fortnightly collections imposed from above.

> ![Image: Eric Pickles speaking into microphone](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1618756.jpg)

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today instructed the Audit Commission to repeal guidance to local authorities that could signal an end to the practice of fortnightly bin collections.

The Audit Commission recently issued a Waste Management Quick Guide to councils across the country. The Secretary of State believes that this document triggered the move to unpopular fortnightly collections and was designed purely as a cost cutting measure. The Secretary of State said that councils have been under the threat of being marked down in their inspection reports if they failed to comply with this guidance.

> ""Families now pay a fortune in council tax - it's time they got a better deal""

The Secretary of State is today writing to the Audit Commission requiring them to repeal this guidance, freeing councils to return to weekly bin collections. If the Audit Commission refuse, the Secretary of State has a legal power to 'direct' the Commission. Today's announcement follows on from the recent decision to cancel the previous government's plans for new bin taxes on family homes.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Fortnightly collections are unpopular and unhygienic. It's the traditional weekly bin round that people want. Diktats imposed from the centre forced councils to listen to bureaucrats over residents.
> 
> ""The new Government will work with councils to freeze council tax and help them improve the frequency of rubbish and recycling collections. Let's use incentives and rewards to increase recycling, rather than cuts, fines and taxes. Families now pay a fortune in council tax - it's time they got a better deal.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1996846,Pickles hails next wave of council transparency,"The next wave of council openness was hailed today by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles as he published the final Code of Recommended Practice for council transparency which will help reveal the fine details of authorities' daily business, including senior salaries and contracts.

Already every council in England except Nottingham City Council publishes data on all their spending over £500 on a regular basis.

Ministers believe that data transparency should extend beyond local spending and that full disclosure should be every council's default position. Councils will now be expected to have regard to the Code in all their data publications. Subject to consultation, ministers are minded to make the Code a legally binding requirement to ensure authorities can be held fully accountable to the local people they serve.

The code of practice calls on local authorities such as councils and fire and rescue services to shine a light on every part of their business, from employees' salaries over £58,200 and details of all their contracts and tenders to details of grants to voluntary organisations, performance information and the locations of public land and building assets. It also establishes three key principles behind council transparency; timeliness, openness and mindfulness of local demand.

Releasing this information to the public could provide a wealth of local knowledge and spark more improvements in the way services are delivered. Faster publication and easier access for the public and companies could open new possibilities for real-time analysis and response and opportunities for small businesses to enter new markets.

The best local authorities have already adopted the code of practice into their normal publishing routines. Councils like Northamptonshire County Council, Hammersmith and Fulham and Windsor and Maidenhead for example have long ago thrown their books wide open for public scrutiny and publish much of the data specified in the code already.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We have always maintained that the best local leaders, those with control of the public purse strings, should be open and accountable for every one of their decisions. We have abolished top down inspection making local accountability more important than ever. Central Government has a role in ensuring that local people can exercise their right to know how their money is being spent and have the information they need to question that spending.
> 
> ""But spending data is just one aspect of transparency. There is a wealth of information on the inner workings of councils across the country - from senior salaries and council assets to everyday decision making processes - and we shouldn't have to be data experts to see and understand it.
> 
> ""The code sets out clear expectations. It will help unlock more information and increase accessibility for everyone, taking us one step closer to our ambition to be the most transparent government in the world.""

In June the Prime Minister wrote an open letter to the Cabinet outlining what the Government has achieved in terms of transparency over the past year and what it intends to do over the next (see link right).

In the spirit of transparency the Department for Communities and Local Government has already released a vast amount of its data, including spending figures, contracts, Ministerial data and organisational information. We will continue to lead the way, and are publishing all 229 responses to the consultation on the Code of Practice today.

### Notes to editors

1. The Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency applies to England only. Local authorities, including councils and fire and rescue services, will be expected to comply with data protection law and to take a risk management approach to payment fraud. ([www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/transparencycode)

2. The Department consulted on the Draft Code of Recommended Practice for Local Authorities on Data Transparency from 7th February 2011 to 14th March 2011. Consultation Summary and all responses to the consultation can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataresponses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataresponses)

3. The Code asks local authorities to follow the three principles of transparency when publishing data - Demand-led, Open and Timely. The Code also proposes the minimum datasets that should be released for reuse.

They are:

  * expenditure over £500, (including costs, supplier and transaction information)

  * senior employee salaries, names, budgets and responsibilities of staff paid over £58,200 - equivalent to the lowest Senior Civil Service pay band

  * an organisational chart

  * the 'pay multiple' - the ratio between the highest paid salary and the median average salary of the whole of the authority's workforce

  * councillor allowances and expenses

  * copies of contracts and tenders to businesses and to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector

  * grants to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector should be clearly itemised and listed

  * policies, performance, external audits and key inspections and key indicators on the authorities' fiscal and financial position

  * the location of public land and building assets and key attribute information that is normally recorded on asset registers

  * data of democratic running of the local authority including the constitution, election results, committee minutes, decision - making processes and records of decisions.

4. The Code is published under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, which gives the Secretary of State the power to issue a code about the publication of information by local authorities about the discharge of their function. The Act also empowers the Secretary of State to introduce subsequent regulation should that be necessary to enforce greater transparency.

5. Details of local authorities' publishing spend data can be found via the Local Directgov council expenditure over £500 search tool (see link right).

6. The Department for Communities is leading the way across Whitehall and Local Government by publishing a wealth of information including spend (see link right).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1646836,Pickles outlines plans to abolish regional government,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced the Government's intention in principle to abolish the remaining eight Government Offices for the Regions across England, subject to using the Spending Review to resolve consequential issues. The final decisions will be made at the end of the Spending Review in the autumn.

Reducing bureaucracy and rolling back regional government is central to the Government's wider aims of transferring power from central government to councils and communities.

The Government has already announced the abolition of the Government Office for London, the Regional Spatial Strategies, the Regional Assemblies/Regional Leaders' Boards and the Regional Development Agencies.

The Coalition Agreement committed Government to a review of the remaining eight Government Offices as part of its wider localism and decentralisation agenda, and Ministers have decided in principle to close the Government Offices for the Regions.

Over the coming weeks the Department for Communities and Local Government will continue to work with other Government Departments, trade unions and others to lead a process to agree arrangements for the transfer of a small number of on-going functions and redeployment of staff.

Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State, said:

> ""I do not believe the arbitrary government regions to be a tier of administration that is efficient, effective or popular. Citizens across England identify with their county, their city, their town, their borough and their neighbourhood. The case for elected regional government was overwhelmingly rejected by the people in the 2004 North East Referendum. Unelected regional government equally lacks democratic legitimacy, and its continuing existence has created a democratic deficit.
> 
> ""Let me be clear: The Government Offices are not voices of the region in Whitehall. They have become agents of Whitehall to intervene and interfere in localities, and are a fundamental part of the 'command and control' apparatus of England's over-centralised state.""

During the Spending Review the 13 sponsor Departments of the Government Offices will work on the details of the closure and transition arrangements and consider how the civil resilience responsibilities will be reallocated. The detailed outcome will be reflected in the final decisions which will be announced in the autumn.

### Notes to editors

1. There are nine offices based in the Government regions: North East, South West, South East, West Midland, Yorkshire and the Humber, London, East Midlands, North West, East of England.  The Department for Communities and Local Government oversees the Government Office Network, on behalf of all sponsor Departments.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1723934,Pickles pledge - no Council Tax revaluation rises,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today confirmed that the Government will not carry out a council tax revaluation in England during the lifetime of this Parliament reassuring local taxpayers that there will be no unexpected revaluation hikes in the next five years.

In addition an independent Data Protection Audit of the Valuation Office Agency's (VOA) council tax database is to be carried out to make sure people's privacy is protected when the Agency assesses properties and stores data. This takes forward the Coalition's desire to defend civil liberties, restore the rights of individuals and in keeping with Britain's tradition of freedom and fairness.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""We are today confirming that there will be no council tax revaluation which could have pushed up taxes on people's homes. The new Government will protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens and halt state inspectors from unnecessary intrusion.
> 
> ""We are standing up for people who have pride in their home, and calling time on the surveillance state.
> 
> ""Hefty council tax bills are a constant financial worry for many people. Today we are setting their minds at ease, and protecting the interests of the less well-off in particular.""

There are also plans for a broader local government resource review that will examine the way councils are funded, to provide greater financial freedoms and decrease dependency on Whitehall funding, which has previously pushed up council tax in many local authorities due to so-called 'gearing' effects.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1600805,"Pickles stops unitary councils in Exeter, Norwich and Suffolk","Wasteful and unnecessary restructuring plans for Exeter, Norwich and Suffolk Councils are to be stopped immediately the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles announced today.

Stopping these changes will save the taxpayer £40m in restructuring costs, remove the risk of further pressure on local council tax bills, and avoid a costly distraction from the priority of delivering local services and genuine efficiency gains.

An urgent Bill is being introduced in Parliament today by the coalition Government to revoke the orders that create the new unitary councils. Subject to Parliament the aim is to enact the Bill by the summer to give certainty and stability for councils' budgets.

The independent Boundary Committee recommended last December that the unitary plans for Exeter and Norwich should not be implemented. There were concerns about affordability, the risk of fragmenting local services, and the lack of widespread local support.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""When the priority must be to tackle the immense public deficit we have inherited, it is ludicrous that taxpayers' money is being wasted imposing a council reorganisation in Exeter and Norwich.
> 
> This Government made it clear in its Coalition Agreement that reducing unnecessary spending would be part of how we cut the deficit. Today I am pulling the plug on this expensive distraction and saving the taxpayer £40m of restructuring costs.
> 
> Councils in Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk will now be able to concentrate on delivering services to their communities and achieving genuine savings for the local people who elected them.""

The Secretary of State also called a halt to the consultation on proposed changes to Suffolk. Councils in Suffolk had been asked to establish a county constitutional convention to reach a consensus on a unitary structure for Suffolk. This will now be cancelled and all restructuring plans for Suffolk will be stopped.

### Notes to Editors

1. The October 2006 Local Government White Paper invited councils to submit proposals for unitary restructuring. In January 2007, Exeter and Norwich City Councils and Ipswich Borough Council submitted proposals. In December 2007, the then ministers judged that these did not meet the full criteria, and asked the Boundary Committee to look at alternative proposals for the whole or part of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk.

2. The Committee provided their advice in December last year recommending a single unitary council for Devon, a single unitary council for Norfolk, and made two proposals in Suffolk - a single unitary council for Suffolk (the Committee's preferred option) or a two-unitary pattern comprising an Ipswich and Felixstowe authority and a Rural Suffolk authority. This was followed by a six week period of representations about the advice and the original proposals from the city and borough councils.

3. The then ministers received over 2,700 representations and had meetings with many of the councils concerned and MPs for the areas. They concluded that the Boundary Committee's recommendations for Norfolk and Devon did not have the support of any of the areas' principal councils and they decided to take no action on the Committee's proposals for those councils. Whilst acknowledging that the original proposals for Exeter and Norwich did not meet all the criteria, the then ministers decided nevertheless to go ahead with them and create unitary councils for those cities from 1 April 2011.

4. Implementing these unitary proposals was estimated to involve £40m restructuring costs to be incurred up to 2014-15. In that period, it was forecast that savings of £39.4m could also be achieved. From 2015-16 annual savings of £6.5m were forecast. Councils should be able to make savings of this scale and more including through sensible co-operation between each other and with partners, without the need for any reorganisation.

5. This decision was challenged in Judicial Review proceedings by Devon and Norfolk county councils. There was a hearing on 28th and 29th April 2010 and a judgment is awaited. The proposed legislation will bring certainty whatever the outcome of Court proceedings.

6. In Suffolk, the then ministers concluded that none of the proposals commanded support from all the Councils, and the Government proposed a County Constitutional Convention comprising the principal local authorities in Suffolk and their MPs to reach a consensus on a possible unitary solution.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1624150,Pickles strips away pointless town hall red tape targets,"Councils will no longer have to work thousands of man hours or waste millions of pounds of taxpayers' money reporting back to Government as part of a new era of transparency and public accountability, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles announced today.

Today Mr Pickles has written to council leaders to tell them that he has instructed the Audit Commission and five other local inspectorates to stop costly top-down reports officially known as the Comprehensive Area Assessments (CAA).

The Government is committed to 'shunning the bureaucratic levers of the past' by replacing the heavy burden of Whitehall oversight with greater public transparency and accountability so councils can focus on frontline services. Independent research put the average annual cost of reporting back to government at £1.8m.

For example Leicestershire councils found they had 90 full time staff collecting and processing more than 3,000 individual data items for central government at a cost of £3.7m a year. They also faced 83 different inspections every year.

Ministers believe ending CAA will save the Audit Commission £10 million and cut significant inspection costs for councils. In 2006 the National Audit Office estimated the overall cost of monitoring local government at £2 billion a year.

Mr Pickles has called for greater transparency and openness to be the default setting for how councils do their business. They should publish all information on the quality of council services online so an army of armchair auditors can make sure services are meeting local needs. This will root out wild overspending, expensive mistakes and unnecessary waste saving the public millions.

Communities and Local Government Secretary, Eric Pickles said:

> ""In the face of the nation's £156bn deficit, Central Government needs to stop the costly top-down monitoring that is engulfing councils and start trusting them to do what is right locally.
> 
> ""Today I have instructed Town Hall watchdogs to stop tying the hands of council workers with unnecessary red tape and paperwork.
> 
> ""It is much more important for the public to know what their councils are doing than having thousands of hush-hush, unseen papers being sent back and forth between Whitehall bureaucrats and the Town Hall.
> 
> ""We are already pushing power as far away from Whitehall as we can and calling on councils to throw open their books to create much more cost effective and efficient local public services.""

Minister for Decentralisation, Greg Clark added:

> ""Too much power has been sucked out of communities and into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy. Transparency can make councils look to the public they serve, not to Whitehall. We need to have safeguards against things going wrong, but it is vital for democracy that we reverse the years of increasing state control and give power and responsibility back to people, communities and councils."" 

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Up and down the country there are thousands of town hall workers who want to make a real difference in their communities. But for far too long too many of them have been tied up in needless bureaucracy which has prevented them from focusing on important work they want to do and their communities need.
> 
> ""Today's announcement is great news for communities. It will help to free up workers to focus on the issues that communities really care about - whether tackling housing waiting lists, improving rubbish and recycling collections or helping the most vulnerable. And with public finances this is a shot in the arm for councils at exactly the right time.""

The Secretary of State is aware that scrapping CAA will not remove all red-tape burdens so he has asked Greg Clark, Minister for Decentralisation, to lead on further reducing the Whitehall burden across the board. Vital inspection where public welfare is at risk, such as of children's social services, will remain to protect the vulnerable.

David Parsons, Leader of Leicestershire County Council and Chair of the Local Government Association's Improvement Board, said:

> ""In Leicester and Leicestershire we measured the cost of data returns and inspection to local agencies to be over £7m. Presumably this is at least matched by the amount national agencies spend dealing with these returns and undertaking these inspections.
> 
> ""Coalition policy recognises that the inspection and reporting regimes have two major unintended effects - to change the focus of local agencies from their citizens towards meeting central Government's demands, and also, inhibiting local agencies in working together on locally agreed priorities, rather than those of their sponsoring Government Department.
> 
> ""The reduction of the data and inspection burden and its refocusing on localities is very welcome.""

### Notes to Editors

The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister's foreword to _the Coalition: our programme for government_, states: ""Our government will be a much smarter one, shunning the bureaucratic levers of the past and finding intelligent ways to encourage, support and enable people to make better choices for themselves.""

2. The Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA) is delivered jointly by the Audit Commission and five other local government inspectorates: Ofsted, Care Quality Commission, HM Inspectorate of Probation, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and HM Inspectorate of Prisons. Ending the CAA process would not affect inspectorate's statutory powers to carry out inspections at their discretion such as when councils are failing.

3. Councils are being encouraged to throw open their files and alongside spending info publish a wide range of data online in an open and standardised format including:

  * information on senior salaries, names and job descriptions
  * councillor allowances and expenses; minutes and papers of council meetings
  * job vacancies that will enable people to see why council wage bills are so high and how many of the positions are for key local services
  * frontline service data - including rubbish and recycling collections, council tax collection rates and details of planning and licensing applications
  * data such as food hygiene reports for food outlets - information which is routinely collected and of interest to residents, but not currently shared in an easily accessible format.

More detail can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1606947](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1607061)

4. Research for the Total Place pilots has found that across Leicestershire's councils, PCT, fire, police and probation services, there are 90 full time staff, at an annual cost of £3.7 million, having to collect and process data for central government, reporting on more than 3,000 individual data items. They are also subjected to 83 different inspections every year, costing £2.2 million in dedicated staff costs and a further £1.4 million in other staff time.

5. PricewaterhouseCoopers report ""Mapping the Performance Landscape"", commissioned by this Department and published in July 2006, estimated that the costs of reporting performance information to central Government was of the order of £2.6 million. This estimate is based on a study of four local authorities.

6. There will be no reduction to the £29bn general grant that local government receives every year meaning that they have the flexibility they need to protect the frontline. Government has already removed the ringfencing for £1.2bn so councils are free to focus on delivering essential services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2020114,Pickles to cut red tape that stops the public from flying flags,"Eric Pickles today announced proposals to make it easier for people to fly flags of their choice without facing costly restrictions and red tape. The moves are intended to boost England's local and national identities and strengthen community cohesion.

Proposals set out today will allow a much wider range of flags to be flown without the need for planning permission. Under current planning rules, only a select few flags are allowed to be flown without express permission from town hall officials. Getting this approval can incur fees of up to £335. Under the new rules, people will be able to fly a much wider range of flags including the flags of football and cricket clubs or town and village flags.

The Coalition Government will also make it easier for communities wanting to celebrate the contribution of our armed forces by easing rules on flying local regimental flags. Other local flags, and projects like environmental awards, could also all be freed up from existing bureaucratic restrictions.

The document published today will give details about proposed changes to regulations governing which flags can be flown without planning permission. If you have any views on this please send them by email to: [cyril.kearney@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:cyril.kearney@communities.gsi.gov.uk).

Mr Pickles said:

> ""If people want to celebrate something that is important to them by flying a flag they should be able to do so without having to fill in forms or paying town hall officials for the privilege. We will make it easier for people to celebrate their allegiance to a cause, a county or a local organisation if they choose to do so.""

General Secretary of the Flag Institute, Charles Ashburner said:

> ""Flags are important to all UK societies and social groups. They are emotive symbols of unity, revolution, sport, tribalism, protest, patriotism and pride. In our super fast world of instant news and ever changing technology flags nevertheless remain the ultimate symbol of identity. I therefore welcome these proposals as potentially the most significant review of flag regulations in a generation.
> 
> ""Eric Pickles surprised and delighted the Flag Institute when he announced, at our Spring Meeting, his intention to liberalise flag flying in the UK. Today's launch makes good on that promise and takes an important step towards encouraging and protecting the huge variety of different community and individual identities of which British society should be so proud.
> 
> ""The deregulation of flag flying regulations in the UK is something which everyone who believes in freedom of expression should support.""

Andrew Rosindell MP, Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Flags and Heraldry Committee said:

> ""The Flags and Heraldry Committee welcomes this consultation by DCLG to relax the rules on flags. Flags are an important part of our national and local identities and the freedom to fly them is essential to our sense of community and patriotism. We thank the Flag Institute for the extensive work they have put into developing this document.""

### Notes to editors

1. Currently the only flags allowed to be flown without consent are any country's national flag; the European Union; the United Nations; the flag of the Commonwealth; the flag of any English county; and the flag of a patron saint which can be displayed only in the county with which the saint is associated.

2. Other flags can be flown with deemed consent. These are a person or organisation's own flag or one advertising an event taking place in the building it is being flown from. These flags must be flown from a vertical flagpole on the roof of the building. Military flags will still need the permission of the relevant body (such as regiment) before being flown.

3. The Department's approach is to extend the categories of flags that may be flown either without consent or with deemed consent. Any flags outside these categories will continue to be prohibited without express consent.

4. Flags are deemed to be advertisements and their display is therefore controlled by the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007 No. 783). Certain flags can be flown without consent (see Schedule 1 Class H) and others can be flown with deemed consent (see Schedule 3 Class 7A). The difference is that deemed consent can be discontinued or restricted in certain circumstances.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1809164,Councils' New Year resolution must be greater transparency,"Every council's New Year's resolution must be to open up their finance books to the public, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today as he kicked off a countdown to the January deadline for putting spending data online.

Ministers have been clear that councils need to show they have done everything possible to reduce waste and duplication to save taxpayers' money before considering frontline services. The local government settlement is helping those most reliant on grants.

Six months ago Mr Pickles wrote to all councils calling on them to throw open their files to make local government spending more transparent and show waste is being eradicated. Research by credit experts Experian has revealed that town halls could be wasting nearly £150m on duplicate payments.

The call for greater transparency includes publishing details of senior pay, councillor expenses, minutes of meetings, and any useful frontline service data of interest to residents or entrepreneurs. Local Authorities now only have until the end of January to get all of their spending data over £500 published online in accessible formats.

Mr Pickles heaped praise on the 144 councils (less than half) that have already gone online, but he gave a stark warning to the 'slow-coach councils' yet to act that they will face tough questions from residents and tough action from him.

The minister's Department is leading the way will all its spending over £500 already up online. In addition it is keeping a close watch on councils, logging progress on a public timeline on its website. A code of practice is due to be published shortly.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""New Year is traditionally a time when the country sets its goals for the year ahead. In 2011 I would like to see every council make their New Year's resolution to cut more waste and fully open their books up to public scrutiny.
> 
> ""I've started by calling for all expenditure over £500 to be put online by the end of the month but councils should not stop there. They should also be willing to show senior and middle management salaries, councillor expenses, job recruitment, and minutes of council meetings.
> 
> ""One hundred and forty four councils have shown they're not afraid to be transparent and I applaud them, but that's less than half, the slow-coach councils only have a month to go before serious questions will be asked about what they've got to hide. Openness is an essential part of a proper modern democracy. The taxpayer has a right to see where their money is being spent, to point out waste and decide local priorities.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1782791,Deck the high streets and take pride in our Christmas celebrations,"As the lights are turned on for Christmas all over the country, Mr Pickles urged councils to take pride in Britain's Christian heritage; celebrating the nativity and all the traditions that have sprung up around it from tinsel and tree lights to turkey. The Cabinet Minister insisted multi-cultural Britain has much to enjoy at Christmas time without abandoning its underlying Christian heritage in a misguided attempt to appease 'politically correct Grinches'.

Mr Pickles also reminded councils that Christmas is one of the biggest annual boosts to the high street economy. Christmas shoppers are a major source of revenue to local shops and council-owned car parks. Councils that embrace the spirit of the season and bring Christmas to town, from luminous lights to competitively priced car spaces are likely to bring in revenue which helps support frontline services and keep council tax down.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""We should actively celebrate the Christian basis of Christmas, and not allow politically correct Grinches to marginalise Christianity and the importance of the birth of Christ. The likes of Winterval, Winter Lights and Luminous deserve to be in the dustbin of history.
> 
> ""We live in tough financial times, but there's no need for town halls to play Scrooge. It is councils' financial interests to draw in shoppers to their town centres at Christmas given the benefits of packed car parks to councils' coffers. Shoppers want to see Christmas lights, Christmas trees, carol services and nativity scenes, and councils should not hesitate in supporting them.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2053482,Local growth will help energise economic recovery,"Putting power into the hands of local people is the right way to unlock the growth needed to support the country's economic recovery, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has said, reporting on Government measures to boost local economies.  
   
The Government is determined to promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth across the whole country, by pushing power away from Whitehall to local communities, businesses and councils.

Huge strides have been made over the last 12 months that have placed local people more in charge of their local economy than ever before so they can remove the barriers preventing private sector investment and spark a new wave of local enterprise. In every area there is local economy action, investment or reform taking place, including:

### Boosting local growth

  * 38 Local Enterprise partnerships that are bringing councils and local business together across 99 per cent of the country to determine and drive new plans for local growth. In Tees Valley, for example, the partnership has already helped to create 458 new jobs, and safeguarded £91 million of private sector investment.
  * There are now 24 local Enterprise Zones that will act as local growth catalysts. Every zone is now actively pursuing their strategies built around the perks government has put on the table to attract hundreds of new businesses and thousands of jobs that will encourage a new generation of entrepreneurs.
  * The £2.4bn Regional Growth Fund is being distributed around the country and is expected to create up to 328,000 jobs and attract up to £8.5bn of private sector investment by 2014. The first two rounds of successful bidders have already been announced. An extra £1bn was pumped into the fund last month by the Chancellor.
  * The £500m Growing Places Fund will give Local Enterprise Partnerships the financial clout to back key infrastructure their areas need to unlock development that will generate jobs and homes.
  * A £400m Get Britain Building investment fund will help re-open ""shovel-ready"" development that has stalled across the country.

Communities in charge

  * Business rate reform is being put in place to make sure that councils and communities will feel the real benefits of development and economic expansion, by allowing money to be reinvested in the local area.
  * The eight largest cities outside London - Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield - are in the process of being given the freedoms needed to become engines of growth.
  * The Community Infrastructure Levy is allowing councils to raise local funds from developers putting up new buildings in their area.
  * The Localism Act, which is now pushing power out to the local communities, business and councils, giving them the freedoms and opportunities to take charge and drive growth in the direction best suited for where they live.

### More homes, simpler planning

  * The New Homes Bonus, which is already ensuring councils that promote housing growth are getting rewarded. A bonus is paid for new homes built or property brought back into use.
  * Public sector land sites in many areas are being identified and freed up. These have the capacity to deliver up to 100,000 new homes through Build Now, Pay Later deals between Government and developers.
  * Proposals to reform the planning system to make it more efficient and straightforward.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""A year ago Central Government and the square mile pulled all the strings, but we've made huge strides to put local people back in charge of their local economies, removing barriers blocking their way and creating incentives and investment needed.
> 
> ""More power has been pushed away from Whitehall than ever before and it is helping to create the conditions for balancing growth across the country that will lead to a sustained economic recovery.
> 
> ""The sky really is now the limit for local communities to grab the opportunities this power shift offers to take control and innovate to boost local growth.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2074815,Markets first to breathe new life into town centres,"Markets across the country are seizing the initiative and leading the drive to revitalise the nation's town centres, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

Mr Pickles praised retail markets groups for agreeing to hold a special ""Love Your Local Market"" fortnight in the summer, and called on all market managers to get involved so more budding entrepreneurs have the opportunity to test and develop their business ideas on a market stall.

Would-be retailers will be able to benefit from proposals such as ""tables for a tenner"", where they can turn up on the day and pay just ten pounds for a stall. Other initiatives include ""market mentors"", where seasoned market managers and traders will offer tips and advice on how to run a successful business.

The move, announced today at a national conference for market and town centre managers, mirrors recommendations in Mary Portas' High Street Review, which recommends that markets become the test beds for prospective shopkeepers to try their hand at running a low-cost business.

The review published last month was commissioned by the Government to look at the future of high streets, and recommends there is a national day to promote markets and help would-be entrepreneurs use markets as a step on the business ladder.

Responding to the call, markets have agreed to go even further, with a series of special market days over an entire fortnight, so markets that only meet on specific days can be involved.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps called on council-run markets to also get involved, and said councils should prepare for the special fortnight by considering steps such as temporary transport and parking arrangements that could maximise the positive impact the markets have on their local economy.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The best markets play a crucial role in community life and the local economy. Whether run by farmers or fashionistas - they can draw shoppers to the area, and are a fantastic testing ground for budding entrepreneurs.
> 
> ""The bustle of a busy market has been a great British tradition for over a thousand years, and big names like Marks and Spencer, Tesco, Morrisons and JJB Sports all started out as a market stall.
> 
> ""So I'm delighted that national markets groups have responded swiftly to the call by Mary Portas, and over an entire fortnight will lend their expertise to people who want to try their hand at running a business.""

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps:

> ""We need a business-led renaissance to bring life back to our town centres. So councils should start exploring every option to make life easier for markets during this special fortnight - from better transport and public conveniences, to temporary pedestrian streets and parking arrangements.""

The National Association of British Market Authorities Chief Executive Graham Wilson said:

> ""We have some fantastic markets around the country and they provide wonderful opportunities for new start-up business. We were delighted with the recognition that Mary Portas gave to markets in her report and we want to be seen to respond positively to Mary's proposals. The whole of the markets industry is supporting ""Love Your Local Market"" and we are determined to show the real benefits that markets provide.""

The conference held today at the Council House in Birmingham was attended by almost 200 representatives of local authorities and market operators.

The Love Your Local Market fortnight will be held from 23 June to 8 July. In the next few weeks the Markets Alliance, the umbrella organisation of the markets industry, will publish a special pamphlet and webpage with guidance to help market managers get involved in the scheme.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1617981,Scrapping regional bureaucracies will save millions,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles is to close down a regional bureaucracy which had been costing £16m a year as part of the Coalition Government's review of spending promises made since the New Year. Two other projects are being suspended.

Eric Pickles has put plans in motion to move swiftly to dismantle the funding and powers of regional local authority leaders' boards, which took over most of the functions and staff of the old regional assemblies and are part of the bureaucratic regional structures the Coalition Government is committed to scrapping. The boards are set to become redundant as the complex and confusing regime of regional spatial strategies which wrested powers on transport, housing and planning powers away from local councils are abolished.

The dismantling of these boards will see local authorities put firmly back in control of delivering the services and provision for their area and will ensure local people can hold their leaders to account.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""This is another step in wresting control from the bureaucrats, stopping the top down diktats and axing unelected, ineffective quangos.
> 
> ""This is the nail in the coffin of the unelected, unaccountable and unwanted Regional Assemblies.
> 
> ""We are unravelling this complex system, putting the community back in charge of how their area develops and saving the public purse £16m at the same time.""

Regional leaders boards had an overall budget of £16m per annum - by closing them down, at least £6m will be saved this year from their running costs.  The decision will also save local taxpayers money as boards also received funding from local councils of more than £10 million last year.

The Communities Secretary also announced a temporary suspension of two projects until they have been reviewed:

  * The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and Yorkshire Forward have paused any further investment in the Sevenstone Sheffield retail quarter regeneration project pending a review of whether the project could deliver better value for money and a clearer assessment of risks
  * Further HCA funding of up to £10m towards the Kent Thameside Strategic Transport Programme has been suspended and will be considered as part of the forthcoming Spending Review.

### Notes to editors

1. Regional local authority leaders' boards were established under the 2009 LDEDC Act. Under the act responsibility for producing the regional strategy was given jointly to the leaders boards (representing local authorities) and the RDA (representing business interests). Leaders' boards in all 8 regions were established last year and took over most of the functions and staff of the old regional assemblies, in particular the spatial planning functions. Other functions include advising on regional funding allocations and providing a collective forum for authorities to agree on housing, regeneration and transport programmes and strategies.

2. The current leaders' boards are:

  * East of England Regional Strategy Board
  * East Midlands Leaders' Board
  * North East Leaders' Board
  * 4NW - The North West Regional Leaders Board
  * South East England Partnership Board
  * South West Strategic Leaders' Board
  * West Midlands Leaders' Board
  * Local Government Yorkshire and Humber.

3. Following the abolition of the regional spatial strategies responsibility for strategic planning will lie with local authorities who will decide how they will work together on planning issues that cross administrative boundaries.

4. Sheffield retail quarter - the current investment proposal under review involves £2m from the HCA, £10m from Yorkshire Forward and £10m investment from Sheffield Council. The HCA has previously invested £42m in land assembly at an earlier stage in the project.

5. Kent Thameside strategic transport programme - also known as ""Homes and Roads"" - consists of 10 transport schemes in the Ebbsfleet and Kent Thameside area, in the boroughs of Dartford and Gravesham. This programme has been in development since 2007, led by a local partnership which includes Kent County Council, Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils. The total cost of the programme is around £200m over the next 15 years, with funding shared between the public and private sectors. A further HCA contribution of up to £10m will be considered as part of the Spending Review.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1804410,Planning paperwork to be radically cut back to help communities drive development,"A radical overhaul of planning policy cutting out thousands of unnecessary central instructions and putting communities at the heart of decision making, has been announced today by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

In recent years, the planning system has become overloaded with central guidance and statements, with vast amounts of paperwork making it too cumbersome for councils, developers and local people to use effectively.

Too much unwanted detail has resulted in a system full of contradictions and has acted as a brake on growth, hindering rather than helping local communities to shape development in their neighbourhoods.

Today Mr Clark is announcing an end to the centralist approach to planning with an ambitious plan designed to consolidate dozens of existing policy statements, circulars and guidance documents into a single national planning policy framework.

The new framework will:

  * hand power back to local communities to decide what is right for them - instead of imposing excessive rigid rules from the centre
  * be more user-friendly and accessible, so that it is easier for members of the public to have a meaningful say in planning decisions
  * make sure that planning is used as a mechanism for delivering Government objectives only where it is relevant, proportionate and effective to do so
  * establish a presumption in favour of sustainable development.

Planning professionals, local authorities, community groups and members of the public will have an opportunity to shape the new framework. Mr Clark is today inviting organisations and individuals to offer their views to the Department on what priorities and policies the Government might adopt to produce the shorter, more decentralised and less bureaucratic national planning policy framework.

Mr Clark said:

> ""We have over 1000 pages of policy and guidance that have made the planning system unclear and burdensome.
> 
> ""This creates vast amounts of paperwork and bureaucracy that burdens developers and limits the power of local people to shape their neighbourhoods around their vision.
> 
> ""The new framework will integrate our current suite of policy statements and guidance into a single concise document. It will focus on the Government's key priorities for planning and help deliver a more effective, decentralised system.""

Today Mr Clark also set out a Work Plan on major infrastructure planning reform to deliver nationally important new infrastructure that will drive economic growth. This includes the steps to be taken to abolish the Infrastructure Planning Commission and drive major planning reform.

Securing investment in new infrastructure is essential to delivering growth over the coming decades. There is expected to be £200 billion of private and public sector investment in infrastructure over the next five years.

Planning decisions on infrastructure of this scale are so important that the Government believes it is right that these decisions should be taken by democratically elected representatives and not by the Infrastructure Planning Commission, an unelected quango.

A new Major Infrastructure Planning Unit, established within the Planning Inspectorate, will take over the IPC's responsibilities once it is abolished. The new Unit will provide advice to Ministers who will take the decisions on nationally important infrastructure projects and grant permissions.

The Government has committed to making decisions at least as quickly as the twelve months allowed under the major infrastructure planning regime and is considering whether we can reduce the timeframe further.

Mr Clark also confirmed the Government's commitment to the delivery of critically important National Policy Statements for new infrastructure.  These will set out the Government's policy on major infrastructure projects such as ports or power stations.

Mr Clark added:

> ""Securing investment in new infrastructure is essential to help rebuild the UK economy and provide new jobs.  We cannot expect to meet the needs of tomorrow with yesterday's infrastructure and reform of the planning system is vital to securing essential investment and achieving economic growth.""

### Notes to editors

#### National Planning Policy Framework

1. The National Planning Policy Framework will streamline the national planning policies set out in Planning Policy Guidance notes, Planning Policy Statements, Minerals Policy Statements and Minerals Policy Guidance notes, plus a number of related Circulars. There are around 40 such documents.

2. The guidance notes and statements cover various planning aspects of climate change, housing, renewable energy, flood risk, Green Belt and waste, and procedural advice such as how to compile development plans.

3. The Government will continue to maintain Green Belt protection, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other environmental designations which protect the character of our country's landscape, stop unsustainable urban sprawl and preserve wildlife.

4. There are also over 100 advisory guidance notes including best practice guides. These will be cut back. Too much weight is often given to this kind of guidance, especially when many professional bodies produce high quality advisory material that is equal or of more use to users of the planning system.

5. National Policy Statements, which will set out the Government's policy on major infrastructure projects such as ports or power stations, will not be included in the Framework.

6. Organisations and individuals will be invited to offer views on priorities and policies that should be included in the new slimlined framework before a draft is produced and available for formal consultation.

#### Major Infrastructure Planning Reform Work Plan

1. For the majority of schemes, decisions will be taken by the Secretary of State responsible for the policy: the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change will take decisions on major energy infrastructure and the Secretary of State for Transport will take decisions on major transport infrastructure.

2. We envisage that applications relating to hazardous waste will be determined by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, and that applications relating to waste water and water supply will be determined jointly by the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government and Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

3. Subject to Royal Assent of the Localism Bill and commencement of relevant legislation, the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be abolished and its functions transferred to the Secretary of State.

4. The Localism Bill was introduced to Parliament on 13 December. Subject to parliamentary time being made available we anticipate that commencement of the relevant parts of the Act will be in April 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2092722,Planning Portal hits the million application mark,"The one millionth planning application has been processed by the Government's planning resource website, a site that has now delivered savings of approximately £285 million to applicants and councils, Planning Minister Bob Neill announced today.

Nearly 60 per cent of all planning applications in England and Wales are now submitted electronically via the Planning Portal, bringing greater efficiency to the planning process for councils who assess and determine applications, and applicants.

Cutting down the number of paper applications has also made a major contribution to reducing the carbon footprint of the planning process by cutting out more than 8,000 tonnes of Co2 from the 32 million pieces of paper that have been saved. This paper:

  * if stacked up would be more than four times higher than the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, or the same height as seven Empire State Buildings with Canary Wharf on top
  * would weigh more than 150 tons, the weight of 21 Double Decker buses plus a camper van
  * would be enough to cover an area the size of West Sussex
  * would create a paper path 5,905 miles along that could stretch from London to Osaka in Japan.

The millionth application was submitted by a householder and will now be processed by Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council.

Communities Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""We are streamlining the planning system, cutting bureaucracy and simplifying the rules to make the whole planning process much more accessible and efficient for both applicants and councils. An important part of this is ensuring we have a swift, robust application process for all people to use easily.
> 
> ""The benefits of using the Planning Portal are clear to see especially with the savings it is delivering on a regular basis. I'm delighted the Portal has reached this very significant, one million milestone.""

Planning Portal director Chris Kendall said:

> ""We are delighted and very proud to reach such a significant milestone in greener and more efficient planning in such a short period of time. We're now targeting ways of making online planning even easier and more user-friendly. We couldn't have reached this point without the support of our partners in local planning authorities and the willingness of industry to embrace new ways of working.""

The Planning Portal, part of the Department for Communities and Local Government, processed its first application in April 2003 and since then has consistently hit tough targets to increase the proportion of planning applications made online.

As well as creating and maintaining the online planning application service, the multi-award winning Planning Portal offers planning and building regulations information, advice and services for the public, planning-related professionals and government.

### Notes to the editors

1. Applicants support findings by KPMG that report savings of a minimum of £120 per application by submitting online. Savings are many times more for larger or more complex applications. Many local authorities, including Doncaster, Kirklees and others, are increasing online working to save staff time and resources.

2. The Planning Portal records nearly 900,000 visits and almost 9,000,000 page views a month (Jan 2012).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1788714,Planning power from town halls and Whitehall to local people,"Neighbourhoods will be the 'building blocks of the Big Society'

Radical new planning reforms were announced today to hand powers down from Whitehall bureaucrats and down from Town Hall officials to communities so local people shape the character of the very neighbourhood in which they live.

In what are being labelled the building blocks of the Big Society, bold changes are being revealed to galvanise local democracy and help build new homes and plan new development with local support, and reward - not punish - those who want to grow and enhance their neighbourhood.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Planning Minister Greg Clark today outlined proposals to decentralise and streamline the planning system, ahead of the publication of the Localism Bill.

  * **Neighbourhood groups to shape where they live**: Communities will be able to come together to decide what their area should look like, where new shops, offices or homes should go and what green spaces should be protected. Parish councils and new neighbourhood forums of local people - rather than town hall officials - will lead the way in shaping their community. If local people then vote in favour of new 'Neighbourhood Plans' in local referendums, councils will have to adopt them.
  * **Direct democracy**: This new stimulus will be one of the greatest incentives to get people and communities to come together to take control of planning. The new powers will also allow communities to give planning approval to chosen sites on local land. This will mean that urgent development can go ahead quickly once the plan is adopted, short-circuiting lengthy planning applications and making the system more democratic and efficient.
  * **Local benefits from local development**: At the heart of the new approach will be a package of powerful incentives, such as the New Homes Bonus, that will encourage the right kind of local development and financially reward those councils and communities that deliver new homes and businesses to their area. Reforms to the Community Infrastructure Levy will also see a meaningful proportion of the levy handed over to the local neighbourhoods where the development takes place.
  * **Vanguards to lead the way**: Ministers are calling on communities to get involved now. The Government would like to see about a dozen local areas come forward to act as vanguards that will trial Neighbourhood Plans in their area. This step will help ensure the experience of these 'Neighbourhood Vanguards' is taken into account before the legislation comes into force.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""For far too long local people have had too little say over a planning system that has imposed bureaucratic decisions by distant officials in Whitehall and the town hall. We need to change things so there is more people-planning and less politician-planning, so there is more direct democracy and less bureaucracy in the system. These reforms will become the building blocks of the Big Society.""

Greg Clark, Minister for Planning and Decentralisation, added:

> ""Most people love where they live, yet the planning system has given them almost no say on how their neighbourhood develops. The Coalition Government will revolutionise the planning process by taking power away from officials and putting it into the hands of those who know most about their neighbourhood - local people themselves. This will be a huge opportunity for communities to exercise genuine influence over what their home town should look like in the future. It will create the freedom and the incentives for those places that want to grow, to do so, and to reap the benefits. It's a reason to say yes.""

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice, said:

> ""Local communities care deeply about where they live and know it better than anyone. Neighbourhood plans will allow civic societies and other community groups to take the lead in setting out what people value, what development is needed and what can change for the better in their area. With the right support, and safeguards to ensure the community voice cannot be ignored, a new era of neighbourhood plans spreading rapidly across the country could transform the ability of people to shape their local area.""

### Notes to editors

#### Vanguards

1. Councils for Eden in Cumbria, Sutton in Surrey, West Dorset District Council, Bristol and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead have already shown an interest in working with their communities. Ministers will consider proposals to become Neighbourhood Vanguards as they come forward.

#### Neighbourhood planning

2. As well as streamlining existing processes, the Government will introduce a new right for communities to shape their local areas by creating neighbourhood plans, and introduce powerful new incentives to encourage local communities to approve sustainable development. The new neighbourhood plans will be flexible so communities will be able to determine the issues or areas to cover and what level of detail they want to go into. Importantly it will enable communities (through a new Neighbourhood Development Order) to define specific developments or types of development which will have automatic planning permission without the need for any application to the local authority. For more complex cases they will be able to grant outline permission so that the right to develop would be established and only the details would need to be approved. This provides certainty which is vital for investment and giving communities confidence in the system. Neighbourhoods can also establish general policies that will steer decisions on traditional planning applications.

#### Defining neighbourhoods

3. Communities will be able to propose the boundaries of their neighbourhood. Neighbourhoods will generally be based on existing parishes and towns but the local council will have a role in mediating and consulting where there are conflicts or no established boundaries. This will provide a stable basis for neighbourhood planning, with local authorities approving appropriate boundaries.

#### Process for developing neighbourhood plans

4. Plans will be taken forward by Parishes or 'Neighbourhood Forums' in places without Parishes. The local council would have a duty to provide support and to ensure compliance with other legal requirements. There will be a light touch examination of the plan by an independent assessor to ensure that it complies with legal requirements and national policy, and is aligned with neighbouring plans and the strategic elements of the council's plan. A referendum (with a simple majority in favour) would ensure that the final plan had public support.

Neighbourhood plans must work inside some limits. It will not be a means for saying no to important growth. If major infrastructure is needed at a national level, such as a high-speed rail line, or if the strategic local plan calls for a certain number of homes to be built. They would still be required to be consistent with national planning policy and to conform to the strategic elements of local authority plans. The Localism Bill will have safeguards to ensure neighbourhood plans do not override these wider ranging plans. The National Planning Policy Framework will be vital in this respect.

#### Adoption

5. The council will have a duty to adopt a legally compliant neighbourhood plan that had been successfully passed by a referendum, giving real power to communities to determine if the plan is acceptable.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1626268,Planning quango closes,"Major infrastructure stays on fast-track as planning quango closes.

A new democratic, fast track system for decision making on major infrastructure projects to support the UK's return to economic growth was confirmed today by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

Mr Clark confirmed that the Infrastructure Planning Commission - a quango with the power to approve major infrastructure projects - will be abolished in line with the Coalition Agreement.

### New democratic system

It will be replaced with a new rapid and accountable system where Ministers, not unelected commissioners, will take the decisions on new infrastructure projects critical to the country's future economic growth.

A Major Infrastructure Planning Unit will be established in the Planning Inspectorate to continue fast-tracking major infrastructure projects like offshore windfarms and nuclear power stations. Ministers will take decisions on applications within the same statutory fast-track timeframe as the current regime.

In addition, all National Policy Statements (NPS), the Government's future infrastructure blueprints, will now be subject to ratification by Parliament. Ministers believe these critically important national documents must have the strongest possible democratic legitimacy.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""New infrastructure is critical to the country's return to economic growth and we believe we must have a fast track system for major projects - but it must be accountable.
> 
> ""The previous system lacked any democratic legitimacy by giving decision making power away to a distant quango on issues crucial to every community in the country.
> 
> ""Today the coalition is remedying those deficiencies by putting in place a new fast track process where the people's elected representatives have responsibility for the final decisions about Britain's future instead of unelected commissioners.""

Energy Minister Charles Hendry added:

> ""A fast and efficient planning system is critical for facilitating investment in much needed new energy infrastructure. By abolishing the Infrastructure Planning Commission we will ensure that vital energy planning decisions are democratically accountable.""

Matt Thomson, Head of Policy at the Royal Town Planning Institute, said:

> ""We welcome the Government's clarification that the function of the IPC is to be retained even if the body itself is not.  It is critical that there is a specialist body with the skills and expertise to consider proposals for essential major infrastructure projects to allow decisions to be made in the national interest.
> 
> ""We believe that people's confidence in the system will be strengthened by the commitment that final decisions on major infrastructure projects will be taken by the Secretary of State within a defined timeframe.""

David Green, Chief Executive of the UK Business Council for Sustainable Energy said:

> ""The UK Business Council for Sustainable Energy welcomes the Government's commitment to continuing the streamlining of the consenting process for nationally significant infrastructure projects, which needs to reflect the pressing national need for energy infrastructure and deliver certainty whilst ensuring meaningful dialogue on proposals with communities.""

New primary legislation will be brought forward to close the IPC. Until it is in place the IPC will continue to consider and determine applications as National Policy Statements are designated to ensure there is no delay in handling applications.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2115423,Planning reforms will deliver local growth with community support,"A new, simplified planning framework that better supports growth and helps creates the homes and jobs that the country needs, puts unprecedented power into the hands of communities, and helps protect and enhance our natural and historic environment was published by Planning Minister Greg Clark today.

The new 50 page document, which replaces over 1,300 pages of inherited policy in 44 separate documents delivers on the Coalition Agreement's commitment to ""publish and present to Parliament a simple and consolidated national planning framework covering all forms of development and setting out national economic, environmental and social priorities"" by April 2012.

The new Framework has been produced following an extensive consultation with Parliament and the public.

The Framework gives guidance to local councils in drawing up local plans and on making decisions on planning applications.

The Government aim is for every area to have a clear local plan which sets out local people's views of how they wish their community to develop, consistent with the Framework and against which planning applications for planning permission will be judged.

Local plans have a responsibility to meet the objectively-assessed needs of their area for homes, business premises, schools and other social and cultural facilities, while protecting and enhancing the natural and historic environment.

The final Framework retains all of the key elements of the draft Framework published in July 2011, including:

  * enshrining the local plan - produced by local people - as the keystone of the planning system
  * making planning much simpler and more accessible - reducing over 1,300 pages of often impenetrable jargon in 44 separate documents into a clear, readable guide of 50 pages
  * establishing a powerful presumption in favour of sustainable development that underpins all local plans and decisions
  * guaranteeing robust protections for our natural and historic environment, including the Green Belt, National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest
  * encouraging the use of brownfield land in a way determined locally.

In addition, the new Framework strengthens the requirement for new development to be of good design; supports local councils who wish to bring into being a new generation of garden cities; allows communities to specify where renewable energy such as wind farms should, and should not, be located; and following the recommendation of the Portas Review allows councils to provide the parking facilities in town centres that will help them compete with out-of-town shopping centres and supermarkets.

The new Framework comes into force with immediate effect for plan-making and decisions. Appropriate implementation arrangements agreed with the Local Government Association have been put in place for local authorities with up-to-date policies in local plans. Immediate advice and support is available to councils through a joint team of the Local Government Association, the Planning Inspectorate and the Department of Communities and Local Government.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""This is another important milestone in the Government's historic mission to transfer power from the hands of unelected bodies and put it in the hands of people and communities. The Localism Act has allowed us to start scrapping Regional Spatial Strategies which gave development a bad name by imposing top down targets that owed nothing to local needs and threatened the Green Belt.

> ""These reforms go a step further and make it clear that local communities have the responsibility and the power to decide the look and feel of the places they love.""

Planning Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""The new Framework has been strengthened by the responses to the consultation. We have confirmed the core reforms, sharpened the definition of the policies, and emphasised the essential balance that the planning system must achieve.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2028954,Plans for a second year's Council Tax freeze set out,"We know households are facing difficult times so we're helping keep living costs down with a second year's council tax freeze, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today, as new scheme details were published.

Estimates of the Government grant boost that every council in England would receive if they commit to holding or reducing average Band D council tax for a second year were published today.

This follows the announcement that Government has set aside an extra £805 million, of which up to £675 million will be available to local authorities in England to help keep council tax down for a further year.

This new support builds on the 2011-12 freeze offer taken up by all councils, boosting what they could get over four years to £3.3 billion if they hold council tax for a second year. The new scheme would mean that local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could once again save up to £72 compared to a 5 per cent rise in council tax on top of this year's council tax saving of up to £72.

The new voluntary scheme will be open to the same councils as last year. Councils that freeze or reduce their council tax next year will get a one off grant equivalent to raising their council tax by 2.5 per cent. Police, and single purpose fire and rescue authorities will get a 3 per cent equivalent, with the Greater London Authority and the City of London getting intermediate offers.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Last year every council signed up to our council tax freeze, but with many families still facing difficult times we're rolling over our successful scheme so councils can keep a lid on bills for another year.
> 
> ""Our two-year freeze promise, potentially worth up to £72 each year to Band D residents, is in stark contrast to the years before when council tax was allowed to double.
> 
> ""Today every local authority can see how we'll back them to hold council tax steady for another year and leave millions of taxpayers with more of their hard earned cash in their pockets.""

### Notes to editors

1. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. This year, 2011-12, the average Band D bill set by local authorities remained at £1,439. In London it was £1,308; in metropolitan areas it was £1,399; and in shire areas it was £1,484. Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double.

2. The value of saving for taxpayers by area from two years of the council tax freeze scheme compared to a five per cent rise can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls).

3. To help local authorities with their budget planning, we have published an estimate of the grant each participating authority would receive. Grants will be finalised in March 2012 once authorities have reported the tax base underpinning their calculation of council tax for 2012 13. A further £675 million will go to help local authorities in England freeze their council tax next year on top of this year's freeze. Of this, the London offer of around £100 million is based on a 2.5 per cent increase for Borough councils, a combined percentage increase of 3 per cent and 2.75 per cent for the Greater London Authority and of 2.75 per cent for the City of London. Details of for each area can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028905.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028905.xls).

4. The scheme for 2012-13 will comprise a one-off payment of grant, which is payable for one year only. The Localism Bill proposes to give the public the right to veto excessive council tax rises. Councils that set council tax increase above a ceiling approved by Parliament each year would automatically trigger a referendum of all registered local electors in their area: [www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1658293).

5. The scheme will be voluntary; and will apply separately to each billing and major precepting authority in England (including police and fire and rescue authorities) rather than to each council tax bill issued. Local precepting authorities, such as town and parish councils, will not be included in the scheme, but the Government urges them to exercise restraint and help make sure no council tax payer faces an increased bill. The Devolved Administrations will receive Barnett consequentials for this additional spending.

6. Assuming that all authorities take up the offer to freeze or reduce their council tax in 2012-13, we estimate Government will provide £3.3 billion of grant over the Spending Review period. A breakdown of the funding for each area can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028914.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028914.xls).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1606473,Port businesses tell minister his tax freeze is saving jobs,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill met with representatives from the port-based businesses affected by retrospective business rate charges to explain the new payments freeze.

The minister heard first hand how many port-based businesses were already benefiting from the moratorium with renewed confidence being shown by overseas companies. Mr Neil also reaffirmed his commitment to press for a fair, long term solution.

Bob Neill said:

> ""I was pleased to meet with representatives of ports businesses, and from what I've heard today it is clear to me that we've made the right decision.
> 
> ""The payments freeze implemented last week has given businesses room to breathe, and they are already feeling the benefit. But these are just the first steps - I am committed to finding a fair, long term solution, and we will continue to work hard to make this happen.""

### ""Jobs have already been saved""

Andrew Finfer, acting on behalf of affected businesses said:

> ""We are extremely grateful to Mr Neill (the Minister) for acting so promptly to resolve this critical problem facing the ports industry.
> 
> ""The mere fact that the matter is set to be resolved has already provided much needed certainty for port-based companies, with the result that overseas companies have more confidence to do business and jobs have already been saved.
> 
> ""We look forward to working with the minister and the department to finally resolve this matter.""

As an urgent first step to meeting the Coalition Agreement commitment, new regulations have been introduced suspending unexpected backdated business rate payments, including for port companies, giving a lifeline to struggling firms and supporting a vital part of Britain's manufacturing industry.

Many ports companies in England were left facing unexpected and significant backdated business rates bills reaching into the millions following a ports review completed by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) in 2008 that revised many bills.

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""The dark tax cloud that has been hanging over some port businesses, the backbone of Britain's export industry, for too long has finally been lifted.
> 
> ""The Chancellor's decision to waive and repay the unexpected rates bills for those affected port businesses is a victory for common sense. Many companies across the country will be able to move forward confidently, unburdened by these unexpected debts. ""

### Looking forward

These unfair, retrospective rates bills had threatened to devastate the export industry which would seriously impact the manufacturing sector. Instead an estimated 700 port-based properties out of a total 3,000 properties across the country could now benefit from this budget decision.

Already a number of businesses are looking forward to a better future:

Andrew Finfer, acting on behalf of affected ports businesses said: 

> ""Port businesses welcome the Chancellor's commitment to abolish and repay the unfair backdated liability to pay rates that has caused so much damage to port businesses.  The businesses and their customers can look forward with confidence to the future unburdened from and no longer distracted by the imposition of unfair taxes that have damaged the industry's competitive advantage. 
> 
> We have no doubt that the Government honouring its pledges will enable businesses to survive, to invest and to create additional employment.""

Jens Nielsen, Managing Director of Shipping Company DFDS Tor Line added,

> ""This has been a long, hard campaign and we are delighted to now see the new Government deliver on its manifesto promises. We have been extremely impressed with the speed with which this matter has been handled and the also the willingness to listen and engage fully with the ports community. The Government has restored our confidence in British politics and we now look forward to again moving our Business forward""

Karl Howarth, Chief Financial Officer of P&O Ferries, said:

> ""We're pleased that at long last we have a government that understands the huge difficulties caused by the port rates debacle and their promise to resolve the issue so that businesses can concentrate on their businesses going forward without this considerable millstone holding them back.""

Local Government Minister Bob Neill went to Birkenhead docks in Liverpool where port companies have had total backdated demands of £12m lifted.

The minister heard from a number of local companies, who told how their businesses had taken an upward turn. While six months ago many were facing contract losses and job cuts, they now have the confidence to invest  and grow, taking on more people and buying new equipment and technology.

Bob Neill said:

> ""Britain's ports, the backbone of our export industry, have had the heavy burden of unexpected tax debt lifted. It's clear that that our swift action has saved many port-based businesses and jobs, and I'm glad to have heard their stories first hand.
> 
> ""The Chancellor's decision to waive and repay the unexpected rates bills for those affected port businesses is a victory for common sense. Companies like these across the country are now able to move forward confidently, unburdened by these unexpected debts.""

David Pendleton, Business Development Director of Mersey Maritme Limited said:

> ""We are very grateful to the Minister and the Government for introducing the moratorium so soon. A lot of very relieved businesses have had a significant cash flow burden lifted and, as well as safeguarding many thousands of private sector jobs, it is now helping to create new private sector jobs as these companies have the confidence to invest in the expansion of their plant and services.
> 
> ""It is also very encouraging that the Government is so committed to scrapping the backdated element completely and removing the problem once and for all. Discussions regarding this matter have been ongoing over the summer.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1966198,Positive planning to let good schools grow,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today introduced new planning measures to support the expansion of popular state schools and the creation of new free schools. Ministers are determined to change the current system which is viewed by many as an obstacle to good schools with long waiting lists being able to expand.

In a new [planning statement](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/planningschoolsstatement), Mr Pickles set out new principles for councils considering proposals for the creation or development of free and other state-funded schools.  The new guidance is a boost for state education and local promoters of the Government's flagship free schools programme, who can now be confident their proposals will be processed swiftly, and that new schools can be set up quickly in response to demand from local people.

The Secretary of State said the measure should allay public concerns that some councils could have a conflict of interest as a local planning authority and a local education authority, or could try to use the planning system to stop new free schools opening. The new rules provide greater certainty for all involved.

The Government is committed to ensuring there are sufficient state-school places and improving choice and opportunity in state education so every child can reach their full potential. Free schools give parents, teachers and community groups the power to establish a state-funded school to help improve standards for all children.

The Government is making it easier for people to create, expand and improve free and other state-funded schools, and today's guidance makes it clear that councils should work positively with communities from an early stage to identify suitable sites and prepare strong planning applications.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Councils need to do more to support the expansion of popular schools, so that school waiting lists are not a barrier to greater equality of opportunity. We also need to avoid councils covertly seeking to use planning red tape to stop the healthy competition of new free schools. These measures will help improve local schooling to the benefit of local communities.""

Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education, said:

> ""We urgently need more good school places. Red tape must not be a barrier.
> 
> ""These important changes will allow talented teachers, parents, charities and Academy sponsors to set up excellent new schools more quickly, responding to parental demand.
> 
> ""Free schools will improve choice for parents, give power back to teachers, and give more children access to a first class education that's close to home.""

The new planning rules set out how planning departments should operate in a positive manner when dealing with proposals for state-funded school.

  * There should be a presumption in favour of the development of state-funded schools including free schools, as expressed in the National Planning Policy Framework

  * Councils should give full and thorough consideration to the importance of enabling the development of state-funded schools in their planning decisions

  * Councils should make full use of their planning powers to support free school applications. This should include engaging in pre-application discussions with promoters and, where necessary, using planning obligations to help deliver development that has a positive impact on the community

  * Planning authorities should clearly justify any application refusal for a free and other state-funded school or any conditions imposed

  * Councils should ensure that a streamlined system for submitting and determining school applications is in place

  * Appeals against refusals of planning permission for state-funded schools should be treated as a priority

The Government is also publishing a [summary of responses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/planningschoolsresponses) to its consultation, _Planning for Schools Development_, and will continue to explore whether there is further scope and need for the planning system to do more to support state-funded schools, and in particular, free schools in the future.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1923169,Positive planning: a new focus on driving sustainable development,"A major change to planning policy that will get development back on track and ensure protection for the environment has been published today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.

The new 'presumption in favour of sustainable development' that will get development underway whilst keeping vital environmental protections is to become the cornerstone of a more streamlined planning system that will cut reams of unwieldy planning policy down to a tightly focused National Planning Policy Framework.

The current planning regime is one of the biggest barriers to providing the homes people want and the businesses local economies need. Developers are also hindered by a planning system that can be slow, costly and gives them no certainty. The presumption will be a key tool in helping to turn this situation round.

The presumption champions the right sort of development at the right level by placing a greater emphasis on councils having a Local Plan in place. Through the plan, local communities will have a say in the sort of development they want and need in their areas. These plans will set out the opportunities for local development and form the basis for planning decisions.

The presumption will help with the country's economic recovery by ensuring proposals in line with Local Plans get approval without delay. It will mean:

  * Communities and councils have a strong incentive to keep their plans up-to-date, and to plan positively for sustainable development. Without an up-to-date plan, decisions will be made according to national policy;
  * Sustainable development can get underway faster. Proposals will be approved without delay if they are in accordance with Local Plans;
  * Developers have more certainty about what will be allowed and where. This will encourage them to bring forward more proposals and reduce the number of planning appeals;
  * Development will not be allowed if it is clearly in conflict with the environmental and other safeguards in the National Planning Policy Framework.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Britain urgently needs new homes, new green energy and transport links, and space for businesses to grow. By putting this presumption at the heart of our new framework we will give the planning system a wake up call so the right sort of development, that everyone agrees is needed, gets approval without delay.
> 
> ""This change to planning policy will speed up development, while placing a strong emphasis on the protection of the environment and local communities' interests. By insisting on sustainable growth we can help make sure that what we build today leaves a positive legacy for future generations.""

This step change will help bring the homes and businesses required to meet the growing needs of many areas. Local Plans give a stronger voice to local people who will have a greater say in the housing, services and business developments in their neighbourhood. Everyone with an interest in the plan will be consulted to ensure it addresses environmental considerations, and businesses will benefit from knowing the right type of land is available and infrastructure needs have been identified.

Liz Peace, chief executive of the British Property Federation said:

> ""The proposed presumption in favour of sustainable development sends a powerful message that allowing development to take place should be the default position where proposed development is in line with a local plan. It also incentivises local authorities to produce and keep up to date their local plans - a welcome discipline. But the presumption is not simply a green light for development. It will still have to be exercised within the protections afforded by national planning policy and community-led local plans.""

Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation said:

> ""The planning system must deliver more homes to address the Country's chronic shortage, in a way that enriches existing communities. Doing so will provide huge social and economic benefits for all. The proposed presumption in favour of sustainable development is a promising start for what is a vital part of ensuring positive planning for housing requirements.""

The Government is taking substantial steps to help local communities protect greenfield sites as they plan for sustainable growth. We are abolishing regional strategies and their top down direction; councils have been given stronger powers to prevent unwanted garden grabbing; Green Belt, sites of special scientific interest and other environmental protections will be maintained; and we will create a new designation to protect green areas of particular importance to local communities.

The presumption in favour of sustainable development has a strong role to play in helping with the country's economic recovery by ensuring proposals in line with plans get approval without delay. Councils will also receive a financial boost from new development from the New Homes Bonus - a payment for each new home built, and the Community Infrastructure Levy - a developers' contribution towards local infrastructure.

Publishing information on the intended approach to the presumption ahead of the consultation on the National Planning Policy Framework gives councils, communities and businesses a clear idea of how it will work, and reinforces the message about the importance of getting up-to-date plans in place.

### Notes to editors

1. This draft wording of the presumption in favour of sustainable development is published now to give an early indication of the Government's intentions, but this is not a formal consultation. The presumption will be at the heart of the new National Planning Policy Framework, on which Ministers plan to consult formally in July. The government will be happy for comments on the wording of the presumption to be included in responses to that wider consultation. The wording can be found at:  
[www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/presumptionfavour/.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1923169)

2. In 2004-05 there were 645,000 planning applications, with 514,000 granted. By 2009-10 the number of applications decided had fallen to 418,000, with 335,000 granted - a 35 per cent reduction in the number of applications approved.

3. Regional plans and targets, known as Regional Spatial Strategies, created a mismatch between proposed level of development and actual delivery. House building in 2009-10 was just 128,680 despite an aim to deliver 213,000 additional homes.

4. By May 2011 53 per cent of local planning authorities had published a Core Strategy. 43 per cent had submitted strategies to the Secretary of State for examination and only 30 per cent had a adopted their Plan.

5. The presumption in favour of sustainable development is a key deliverable of the Government's Plan for Growth, published in March 2011.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1914100,"Positive reaction to new powers brings more communities eager to bring growth, jobs and homes to their neighbourhood","Dozens more communities eager to test radical new rights that will give local people much greater ability to bring growth and shape development in their area, were announced by Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today.

40 communities - a mix of cities, urban and rural areas - are to join 50 other communities already trialling neighbourhood planning a powerful new right being introduced in the Localism Bill. The positive reaction to the first wave of communities announced last month and developing neighbourhood plans has led to many more communities coming forward.

Neighbourhood planning is a key reform designed to create the conditions for communities to welcome growth by giving local people a real voice in deciding the look and feel of development in their area; from determining the locations of shops, offices and schools to setting standards of design for new housing.

Local people will for the first time be able to decide the types of development given automatic planning permission through a Neighbourhood Development Order. If approved by a local referendum, a council will need to adopt a neighbourhood plan providing it is line with wider ambitions for growth in their area.

Neighbourhood planning complements reforms announced in the Budget to ensure the planning system does everything possible to support economic growth and sustainable development. These measures include allowing communities to share directly in the benefits of growth through the New Homes Bonus.

Greg Clark said:

> ""For too long people have felt alienated from the planning process and had little influence over changes to their area. Neighbourhood planning will help reverse that by putting communities at the heart of shaping developing in their area.
> 
> ""The large number of communities, eager to trial neighbourhood planning proves that localism and growth do go hand in hand. By giving local people a greater say and incentives to benefit from growth, communities will start to welcome development rather than resist it.""

The 40 neighbourhood planning front-runners will be led by Local Authorities who will work with community groups and parish councils to prepare draft plans and Neighbourhood Development Orders.

Each of the 40 areas will receive £20,000 towards developing their plan from a £5 million fund set up to help those communities eager to trial neighbourhood planning in 2011/12.

Applications are also being invited from other communities eager to trial neighbourhood planning as part of the fourth wave of frontrunners. Further details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/neighbourhoodplanningvanguards/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/neighbourhoodplanningvanguards/).

A detailed guide to the Bill can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localismplainenglishguide](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localismplainenglishguide).

2. When the provisions of the Localism Bill are enacted, Neighbourhood Plans will give communities a much greater say on what gets built, but must be in line with wider ambitions for growth in the council's development plan.

3. Local people will be able to define types of development which will have automatic planning permission. This is known as a Neighbourhood Development Order.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1688366,Power to local people to preserve village life,"A new report today backs Government plans to put power in the hands of rural communities to protect and preserve village life.

The Rural Challenge is published by a newly formed Rural Coalition, and argues that without radically empowering local people to make decisions about their communities, rural villages could be under threat.

Alongside proposals to devolve power to residents, the coalition also calls for reform of the Housing Revenue Account system so councils can keep money from selling council homes to reinvest in affordable rural homes, and giving communities a leading role in planning for new neighbourhoods.

Last month, Housing Minister Grant Shapps announced plans to give rural communities a Right to Build, under which they would come together to approve plans for new homes, shops and community facilities to protect and preserve rural village life.

Under the proposals, which will be contained in the Localism Bill, community organisations will have the freedom to give the green light to new local developments without a specific application for planning permission, as long as there is overwhelming community backing in a local referendum.

Any surplus made from the sale or renting of homes would be recycled for the benefit of the community.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Far from the Nimbyism that often hits the headlines, up and down the country there are entire communities willing and eager to give the go-ahead for new developments in their area. The countryside must be a vibrant place to live, and cannot be allowed to become a museum. I want to give communities the power to preserve their villages, which are currently struggling to survive because of a shortage of affordable homes.
> 
> ""With housebuilding at its lowest level in any peacetime year since 1924, some areas are facing a battle to keep schools and GP surgeries open as younger people are forced to move away. The new Community Right to Build could provide the answer. It will give residents the power to give the green light to new homes that are suitable and appropriate for their local area. And because local people are in charge, developments will only go ahead with their overwhelming support.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1884237,Prime Minister busts the myths on red tape for Royal Wedding street parties,"The Prime Minister David Cameron has said today that people planning a Royal Wedding street party should be able to organise their celebrations without any red tape or legislation getting in the way - and urged people to get planning.

It is estimated that 2 million people will take part in street parties across the country on 29 April, but many may have been put off by rules and regulations imposed by councils.

Today the Prime Minister went about busting the myths associated with setting up events and encouraged all councils and organisers to use a common sense approach - sweeping away unnecessary red tape.

The Prime Minister said:

> ""The Royal Wedding is an exciting occasion for people across Britain to come together - and one great way of doing that is by setting up a street party.
> 
> ""There are already around 4,000 street parties planned across Britain - and there's still time to organise many more. We'll be holding one in Downing Street and bringing together local people and charities.
> 
> ""To those councils that are asking small groups of neighbours for licenses, insurance and other bureaucracy my message is clear: don't interfere, don't get in the way, and don't make problems where there are none. Let people get on and have fun.
> 
> ""And my message to everyone who wants to have a street party is: I'm having one and I want you to go ahead and have one too.""

The Government has taken action to withdraw central guidance and worked with charities, councils and local partners to make it easier for people to organise a street party or fete. Ministers have strongly encouraged councils to do their bit to support this national day of celebration and ensure everyone's energy goes into the fun part - not trawling through reams of paperwork.

Last August, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles tackled the reams of forms, high costs and red tape getting in the way of communities organising street parties and summer fetes. He issued new guidance and replaced the complicated bureaucracy of forms, permissions and risk assessments with a simple checklist which most local authorities are now using. He also called for a proportionate, common sense approach from councils for fun events.

Today, Mr Pickles said:

> ""This is a real opportunity for councils to help local residents from all backgrounds to come together, and reinforce our shared identity and sense of Britishness. Of course we want people to be safe and sound but common sense has to prevail and people should use their rights as citizens and challenge councils if red tape rules are being used against them"".

In February, the Transport Secretary Philip Hammond wrote to local councils in England scrapping the Department for Transport guidance on road closures. The guidance - which was intended to cover all types of special event - was sometimes being misinterpreted by councils causing them to impose extra bureaucracy and costs on residents. Some communities were being told they would need to employ traffic management companies to close off their road when holding even small street parties. Now this guidance has been abolished, councils all over the country are encouraged to avoid charges for street party road closures.

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said:

> ""Local authorities should support people's plans for Royal Wedding street parties, rather than work against them.   
   
""There should be a strong presumption in favour of allowing road closures in residential areas where appropriate alternative routes for traffic are available.  
   
""Councils should apply the lightest possible touch to administration and always think twice before charging fees. The wedding should be a great occasion for everyone across the country, let's not let bureaucracy and form filling get in the way of a truly national celebration.""

Minister for health and safety Chris Grayling said:

> ""The Royal Wedding will be a great national occasion, and I want to reassure everyone that they can have street parties with friends and family and bring out the bunting to celebrate in time-honoured British tradition. There is no reason whatsoever for anyone to ban these celebrations on the grounds of health and safety. We are restoring common sense to our health and safety system, ensuring it is there to protect people at work not penalise people at leisure.""

From today, people can use the [DirectGov website](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1580&LGIL=8&ServiceName=Find%20out%20how%20to%20hold%20a%20street%20party) to access local information on street parties by entering their postcode.

### Street party myths

  * **That the law requires complex forms for a road closure and councils need to sign off every detail.** For most small parties in quiet streets, all your council needs to know is where and when the closure will take place so they can plan around this (for example, so emergency services know). And you can organise a street party or 'Street Meet' in another space such as a local park without any requirement to fill in council forms. If councils really need more information, they will contact organisers. If councils ask for excessive information, they should be challenged.
  * **That you need insurance.** There is no requirement from central government to have public liability insurance. Many councils do not insist on it, so you can challenge those who do.
  * **That you need a food license.** Again there is no requirement for this.
  * **The law requires a fee to be charged for a road closure.** The Department for Transport has scrapped guidance that was being used by councils as an excuse to charge people wanting to close their road. Many councils will charge nothing for Royal Wedding street parties. If your council is charging, you have every right to challenge them.
  * **It's too late to ask for a road closure.** Some councils have set deadlines to help them manage their work. But there are no requirements in law so if those deadlines look unreasonable, ask your council to be flexible. You may be able to organise a 'Street Meet' - a gathering in a park, driveway or cul-de-sac. Residents should speak to their council about plans and Streets Alive have some excellent guidance on how to do this: [www.streetparty.org.uk/residents/street-meet.aspx](http://www.streetparty.org.uk/residents/street-meet.aspx) (external link).
  * **You need to buy expensive road signs.** Some local councils will lend you signs and cones.
  * **It's too difficult and confusing.** Streets Alive has a great website to help you plan and people can also use DirectGov to access local information and contact details for further advice. (by entering postcode at the [DirectGov website](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1580&LGIL=8&ServiceName=Find%20out%20how%20to%20hold%20a%20street%20party)).
  * **You need an entertainment licence.** Some councils argue that you need a licence for live entertainment - that's not the case. [The Licensing Act 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/17/schedule/1/part/2/crossheading/garden-ftes-etc) (external link) explicitly exempts garden fetes ""and functions or events of a similar character"" from being regarded as the provision of regulated entertainment, provided the proceeds of the event are not used for the purposes of private gain.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1760858,Pub at the heart of community puts its stamp on local services,"### British Pub Week - focus on The Kings Arms, Cumbria

The Kings Arms is a family run village pub located in the village of Stainton near Penrith in Cumbria, that offers more than just a pint and a packet of crisps. When the local post office was threatened with closure, licensee Mr Jakeman and the family stepped in to keep a vital community service going by moving the post office into the pub's garage.

The pub is at the heart of the 1000 strong village community and is one of a handful of local services that includes a farm shop and a hotel. The post office is a lifeline to many residents with many previously travelling up to 6 miles to collect parcels, pensions and a much needed social outing.

The new centrally located post office has been so convenient that it has created the need for a grocery shop alongside it, selling newspapers, confectionery, stationery and a small range of locally sourced products including bacon, milk, eggs and logs and kindling for wood fires.

Richard Jakeman, Kings Arms Licensee said:

> ""Since taking over the Kings Arms we quickly understood its importance to the community, not only for employment but for social means. When the post office was faced with closure it seemed the natural place to keep it in a central location at the heart of the community. Since taking on the project, my family has never looked back, the combined services provide a service to the community a focal point for them to meet, pass on any information and keep an eye out for the vulnerable. Since the opening of the post office, it has strengthened the community and created a need for a shop alongside the pub.
> 
> ""During tough winter months when the community can be isolated, our pub business has helped keep the community functioning. It also provides a much need service to the elderly and immobile for whom it is a vital lifeline.""

Bob Neill said:

> ""Pubs are a great British institution so we should all raise a glass to British Pubs Week. Since they emerged from Roman Taverns and Anglo-Saxon alehouses, pubs have been at the social heartbeat of life in our towns and villages.
> 
> ""As Minister with a responsibility for community pubs I am determined to protect the valuable role pubs play in local society. That's why we will give landlord the power to take over local services threatened with closure or residents the power to preserve their pub in our Localism Bill. Already there are great examples of pubs across the country being innovative to survive. This is an industry alive with creativity and I'm keen to hear more from publicans over the coming months about what the Government can do to protect the local pub.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2064855,Public given chance to vote off the weakest regulations,"Communities Minister Baroness Hanham is asking people to vote out policies they think are the weakest links, in a drive to eliminate ineffective and unnecessary regulations from the country's housing laws.

From today the Government's Red Tape Challenge is shining a spotlight on all housing and construction related regulations. Any simplification will not come at the cost of quality, and smart regulation will encourage growth while maintaining high safety standards and legal protections.

Baroness Hanham is asking members of the public and interested parties such as builders, businesses, owners, tenants and landlords to look through the list and see how the system can be simplified.

They will be asked to identify excessive or complicated legislation that is acting as a barrier to the business and investment needed to help reinvigorate housing and construction in this country.

The review of regulations will reflect the approach taken in Housing Strategy published in November last year. The Strategy outlines how the Government is committed to better environmental standards; more affordable housing; security of tenure; legal protection for tenants and leaseholders; and support for the elderly, vulnerable households and those on low incomes.

The Government has already taken a series of steps to cut unnecessary red tape, including abolishing Home Information Packs, reducing burdens on short-term holiday lets, removing blanket regulation on Houses of Multiple Occupation that would have reduced choice for tenants, and introduced new freedoms and flexibilities for social landlords via the Localism Act. This review will help inform the scope for further reductions of such unnecessary and disproportionate red tape.

Baroness Hanham said:

> ""For years builders, businesses, landlords and residents have had to navigate an increasingly complicated set of rules and regulations to do things by the book. Now we're giving them the chance to tell us what they would like us to change so that building a new home or property is a smoother ride.
> 
> ""The Red Tape Challenge has already helped the Government update or remove hundreds of regulations and I'm confident that with the help of the public and the people who see housing law in action every day, we can streamline housing and construction law while protecting the high standard of  buildings and infrastructure that this country needs.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Years of Government tinkering with technicalities have lead to a tangle of red tape and regulations that make every step toward growth and investment a battle of wits, with only the toughest left standing.
> 
> ""At a time when demand for high-quality, affordable housing has never been higher, it's time to unravel the rules.
> 
> ""This is an opportunity for anyone who has had to test their strength, wits and patience battling this bureaucracy to tell us which laws are worth their weight in gold and which should be sent to the scrapheap.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1809061,Pubs see in the New Year with lifeline from minister,"Pubs Minister Bob Neill has given the pubs industry a hearty New Year cheer after pledging to review the rules that prevent precious community pubs and hubs from reopening again as public houses or entertainment venues.

Mr Neill said that a public consultation will look at the issue of 'restrictive covenants', a clause that can be used in the sale of a building that restricts the use by new owners. Pubs groups such as the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), have said that covenants can be used by large companies to limit competition and close local pubs, with no hope of having them reopened.

Pubs Minister, Bob Neill, said:

> ""The pubs and clubs in our community can be the heart and soul of a town, village or street and many of us will be heading off to our local this evening to celebrate the New Year. But too many are being closed down, depriving communities of important places to get together with their neighbours for a quick pint and a catch up.
> 
> ""For too long now communities have felt shut out when rules prevent a building being used again as a public house or community club. I want to stop that and put local people in charge. By reviewing the use of this restrictive piece of red tape it is another boost for localism and means that communities could use their collective powers to keep important hubs of community life open.""

Large pub companies often use covenants to remove competition or when there is a motive to change the use of a pub, to residential or commercial use. CAMRA, the Plunkett Foundation and Pub is the Hub have previously said that pub covenants are too restrictive.

By changing the use of restrictive covenants, communities have greater opportunity use the new 'Community Right to Buy' power in the Localism Bill, and take over a local pub if it comes up for sale.

The Right to Buy measure gives local groups the legal right to nominate any vital community asset including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. If a listed asset goes on the open market, its sale will be delayed triggering a 'community countdown' that will give people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to bid.

Mike Benner, the Chief Executive of CAMRA said:

> ""Restrictive covenants are used by pub companies to deprive local communities of their pubs, at a time when 29 pubs are closing every week. Between 2004 and 2009, this happened to almost 600 pubs.
> 
> ""This announcement that the Government will consult on the use of restrictive covenants is a great success for localism, and shows that Government recognises that pubs are vital community assets that need to be protected. For the new community right to buy scheme announced in this week's Localism Bill to work, pubs need to be available for communities to keep open.
> 
> ""It's a victory too for people power: this proposal came from communities on the ground, via their local councils who put the proposals to central Government.""

### Notes to Editors

  1. Three local councils (Darlington, Newcastle upon Tyne and Ryedale) have applied under the Sustainable Communities Act that the Government take action on the issue of restrictive covenants. As a result, the government agreed to a public consultation on the issue as a means to understand the local level impact of covenants on communities. Further information about the Sustainable Communities Act can be seen here: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/scadecisions](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/scadecisions)
  2. By Summer 2011, DCLG will undertake a public consultation on the issue of covenants, with a particular focus on pub covenants and the local level impact on communities. The consultation will also look at whether power for either local or central government would be necessary and useful to aid the issue and what form any powers would take.
  3. The Community Right to Buy measures are included in the Localism Bill, announced on Monday 13 December.
  4. The Community Right to Buy will require local authorities to maintain a list of sites of community value put forward for consideration by communities. The local authority will assess the suggestions before recording on the list. When listed land comes up for disposal (either the freehold or a long leasehold), communities will be given the chance to develop a bid and raise the capital to buy the asset. They will then be in a better position to bid to buy the asset when it comes on the market at the end of the moratorium.
  5. This will help local communities to save sites which are important to the community, which will contribute to tackling social need and building up resources in their neighbourhood. The Bill will provide the framework for the Right, the detail of which will be set out in secondary legislation, and subject to public consultation in the New Year.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1703847,Queen's portrait given pride of place in government department,"A portrait of Her Majesty The Queen has been unveiled in the reception of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

One of Communities Secretary Eric Pickles's first actions after his appointment in May was to order the portrait, putting the Monarch centre stage in the department's Eland House headquarters in central London. There was previously no portrait at all in the entire Whitehall department, despite it being the legal title holder of the Government's civil estate on behalf of the Crown.

The portrait was unveiled in a ceremony in Communities and Local Government's headquarters attended by Minister of State Greg Clark and Acting Permanent Secretary Irene Lucas.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Queen has an extremely important role to play in unifying people, no matter what their social background, race or religion. I'm delighted this portrait has now been given pride of place in the building and I hope it will encourage other government departments, councils and businesses to follow suit.""

The small capital cost of the new official portrait in Eland House, Victoria, was funded through savings made by consolidating seven sets of papers and periodicals for ministers and special advisers, delivering over £15,000 a year in ongoing revenue savings.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1600142,Queen's Speech,"A Bill that would shift power from the state to local communities and empower local people forms part of the Queen's Speech alongside a CLG Bill to revoke the previous Government's plans to create unitary councils in Exeter, Norwich and Suffolk.

### Foundations for the Big Society

The **Devolution and Localism Bill** would set the foundations for the Big Society by shifting power from the central state back into the hands of individuals, communities and councils.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""This important Bill would shift power from the central state back into the hands of individuals, communities and councils. It will empower local people giving them more power over local government. It will free local government from central and regional control so that they can ensure services are delivered according to local needs.""

Some of the **Coalition Agreement commitments** would be legislated through the Localism Bill including:

  * Returning decision-making powers on housing and planning to local councils by abolishing Regional Spatial Strategies;

  * New powers for communities to help save local facilities and services threatened with closure, and the right to bid to take over local state-run services;

  * Giving councils a general power of competence;

  * Giving residents the power to instigate local referendums on any local issue and the power to veto excessive council tax increases;

  * Greater financial autonomy to local government and community groups;

  * Outright abolition of Home Improvement Packs;

  * Create Local Enterprise Partnerships - joint local authority-business bodies to promote local economic development.

Greg Clark, Minister for Decentralisation, added:

> ""This Bill would reverse years of creeping state control and return power to people, communities and councils.
> 
> ""We have an optimistic vision that supports people to work in the interests of their communities, rather than telling them what to do. When you decentralise power you unlock creativity and dynamism that gets better results, better services and better value for money.
> 
> ""The state alone is often too monolithic and clumsy to tackle our deepest social problems and we believe that the best ideas come from the ground up, not the top down.""

### Council Restructuring

The speech also included a **Local Government Bill** to revoke the previous Government's plans to create unitary councils in Exeter, Norwich and Suffolk.

The Secretary of State added:

> ""This urgent Bill would stop the unnecessary restructuring of councils in Norfolk, Suffolk and Devon that would lead to a massive upheaval in all the local councils in those county areas, diverting time and money away from improving frontline services.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2141890,Queen's speech sets out parliamentary plans for local audit overhaul,"A new Bill setting out measures to close the Audit Commission and establish new arrangements for the audit of local bodies was part of Her Majesty The Queen's State Opening of Parliament today.

![The State Opening of Parliament ](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2141577.jpg)The State Opening of Parliament

The draft Audit Bill will be published during the summer for pre-legislative scrutiny. It will be debated by MPs as soon as Parliamentary time allows. The legislation would free local councils and other public bodies to appoint their own independent auditors from an open and competitive market.

The local audit reforms, together with the end of inspection work and the disbanding of the Commission, would save the public purse around £650 million over five years.

A more transparent and accountable local public audit framework based on the private sector model would be established in the Audit Commission's place. National Audit Office oversight would maintain high standards of scrutiny over public money.

Ministers first announced plans to formally close down the Audit Commission's centralised inspection regime in 2010.

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This new Audit Bill will allow us to formally close down the centralised Audit Commission and replace it with a more streamlined and competitive local system.
> 
> ""Putting councils in control of their own auditing affairs will save the public purse £650 million over five years and bring about the new arrangements that increase their public accountability.""

### Notes to editors

1. Text from Her Majesty The Queen's State Opening of Parliament speech:

> ""A draft Bill will be published setting out measures to close the Audit Commission and establish new arrangements for the audit of local public bodies.""

2. Around 11,000 local public bodies are audited under the Audit Commission's regime, including local government, health and police bodies, national parks authorities and passenger transport executives. Smaller bodies are handled separately from larger bodies.

3. The draft Audit Bill would aim to:

  * give local public bodies the freedom to appoint their own auditors from the private sector, on the advice of an independent panel;

  * establish a new regulatory framework for local public audit, mirroring that in the private sector;

  * transfer responsibilities to the National Audit Office to set the scope of local public audit and produce supporting guidance for auditors.

4. The Audit Commission's central inspection regime has been halted saving around £45m a year. Outsourcing of the Commission's in-house audit practice to the private sector has also commenced. This will deliver 40 per cent fee reductions for councils when the contracts commence in September 2012 saving local bodies an estimated £250 million over 5 years. A small residual Commission to oversee the outsourced contracts until the Commission is formally abolished.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1775875,Radical reforms for social housing,"Plans for the most radical reform of social housing in a generation have been announced by Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.

### Power shift

The changes will bring a fundamental shift of power from Whitehall to councils and local housing associations.

> ""The new system will protect the most vulnerable in society, ensuring those in greatest housing need are given priority.""

Mr Shapps said the current centrally-determined rules to allocate social homes are unfair and, despite £17bn of investment in new social housing over the last 13 years, have caused the number of people on waiting lists to nearly double to five million people, whilst a quarter of a million social homes remain overcrowded, and 400,000 under-occupied.

Councils will now be given more flexibility to use their social housing stock to the maximum effect and drive down waiting lists, which currently stand at five million people. Housing Associations will also be given the option to offer new affordable rents and use this revenue to build more affordable homes.

### Fairness and flexibility

Proposals have been published to make the system fairer. Councils will have greater local discretion to decide allocations and the option to offer flexible tenancies.

Councils will also have more flexibility to help homeless families and existing tenants who may be trapped in unsuitable accommodation, or who are unable to take up a job offer because they can't move.

The rules will strike a sensible balance between the needs of new and existing tenants, and ensure the support that social housing provides is focussed on the most vulnerable and those who need it most, for as long as they need it.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For far too long in this country there has been a lazy consensus about the use of social housing, which has left one of our most valuable resources trapped in a system that helps far fewer people than it should.
> 
> ""The new system will protect the most vulnerable in society, ensuring those in greatest housing need are given priority. It will also be more flexible, with councils and housing associations able to offer fixed tenancies that give people the helping hand they need, when they need it. But above all it will be fairer - councils will now be able to make decisions that genuinely meet the needs of local people, and the changes will not affect any existing tenants.""

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""To have five million people stuck on social housing waiting lists is unacceptable - clearly this system is broken and needs a radical overhaul.
> 
> ""We need to have a much smarter system that protects lifetime tenancies, but also provides the flexibility to ensure that help is targeted at people who really need it, and enables us to get more for every pound of taxpayers' money. In times of economic hardship, it is vital that social housing is effective in helping people get back on their feet.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1784652,Rainy day reserves could help councils invest to save,"Councils that have put aside significant amounts of money in recent years should not shy away from dipping into their reserves in tough times to help manage the consequences of the economic downturn, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

All councils keep large sums of money in reserve so that they have a financial cushion to meet sudden unexpected costs. English Local Authorities currently have around £10 billion of in reserves for the period 2010/11 and over fifty individual local authorities have over £50 million in reserves.

The economic downturn, public debt and the need to drive down unnecessary spending mean councils are facing additional budget pressures. Ministers believe that it is sensible, as part of wider financial planning, for council treasurers to consider drawing on their reserves to address short term costs and pressures, such as necessary restructuring, and to invest now in order to realise savings in the longer term. Low interest rates have significantly reduced the revenues from council reserves.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Good financial planning is about putting a little extra away when the sun is shining so you have some cover during the rainy days.
> 
> ""But building up reserves isn't simply about turning town hall vaults into Fort Knox. These untapped funds exist to ensure councils can respond to unexpected situations like the pressing need to tackle the nation's unprecedented level of debt.
> 
> ""Just like any household facing challenging times, all good councils should be considering the merits of temporarily dipping into the money they have set aside as part of their plans to address immediate financial challenges, with a view to building up their reserves again in the sunnier days to come.""

Reserves can also provide councils with a way of avoiding avoid false economies. Finding additional funds with which to meet upfront costs could help councils deliver projects now that will realise savings in years to come. This kind of 'invest to save' spending could include:

  * Improving energy efficiency - greening up council buildings and homes, switching to more energy efficient street lighting and installing renewable sources of energy all offer the potential to reduce council energy bills, reduce carbon emissions but also potentially establish new income streams for councils

  * Increasing online transactions - online customer services have been measured as a cheaper per transaction often leading to improved access to information, satisfaction and delivering new savings to councils

  * Making smarter use of technology - Many councils are looking at improving mobile IT to support people working from home, electronic purchasing and invoicing and using alerts to remind customers of appointments

  * Co-locating services - investing in new facilities and ways of working in order to bring more services under on roof thereby reducing running costs.

### Notes to editors

1. The reserves are from 'budget forecast' returns for 2010-11 provided by local authorities to the Department. The full list of council reserves can be found in the spreadsheet below (see 'Download').

2. Reserves are either 1) earmarked, as a result of a policy decision by a local authority to use them for specific purposes (it should be noted that some earmarked reserves have to be set aside for specific purposes under statute); or 2) unallocated, these reserves are part of a local authority's risk management process, which would be called upon in the event of the need to meet unexpected costs, and emergencies, such as flooding.

![Prime Minister addresses Communities and Local Government](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1635156.jpg)

In a speech to civil servants this morning the Prime Minister unveiled revolutionary reforms that will ""turn the Government on its head"" through fundamental Structural Reform Plans to make every department accountable to the public. He pledged to transform the way the country was run saying:

> ""We want to give people the power to improve our country and public services, through transparency, local democratic control, competition and choice.
> 
> ""It really is a total change in the way our country is run - from closed systems to open markets, from bureaucracy to democracy, from big government to Big Society, from politician power to people power.""

### Radical decentralisation programme will hand power to the public

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said in a speech today that the department's new 18 month programme will deliver radical decentralising and transparency reforms to make the Big Society part of every day life. 

Mr Clark believes too much power has been sucked out of communities into Westminster eroding trust in politics, and sapping responsibility and initiative with stifling bureaucracy. The plans will replace the old, top-down systems of targets and central mismanagement.

Already Ministers have begun to remove swathes of centralising and red tape policies including ending Regional Strategies and putting housing back into local hands, ending unwanted garden grabbing, abolishing Home Information Packs and a burdensome council inspection regime.

The new 45 point action plan will force the department to shift gear so its purpose will be putting localism into action instead of ruling by central diktats.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""We're busting open the established way of doing things. The department will now only work to empower people, not to keep Whitehall in power.
> 
> ""Councils are no longer going to be strangled by prescribed one-size-fits diktats on the one hand and smothered by regional bureaucracy on the other.
> 
> ""We won't be micromanaging, second guessing, and interfering in your affairs any more. We're going to put citizens and communities in control.""

Communities and Local Government was one of the first departments to publish its plans for implementing its radical decentralising and transparency reforms set out in the Coalition Agreement. Voters will measure the Government's performance against the key milestones and priorities set out in the plans.

The Communities and Local Government's Structural Reform Plan will set out the department's five priority actions for making localism and the Big Society part of everyday life by:

  * decentralising power as far as possible
  * meeting people's housing aspirations
  * putting communities in charge of planning
  * increasing accountability
  * letting people see how their money is being spent.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2129178,Red tape holding back councils cut by more than a quarter,"The Government has reduced the amount of 'red tape' data collections it expects councils to send by over a quarter - giving them more time to focus on residents and local priorities, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The new 2012-2013 list of the information councils are expected to report to central government, published today, shows a reduction in demands from 193 data collections last year to 156 this year.

The Government introduced the single comprehensive list of required data collection last year as a way to reduce the burden of top down demands.

Cracking down on pointless bureaucracy and freeing councils from regulatory burdens is a top priority. Since summer 2010 the Government has ended 56 separate data collections placed on local government and seriously scaled back a further 19. This builds on decisions to end over 4700 local government targets.

Councils, for example, no longer have to spend time and money, on sending in complex planning monitoring or completing a housing subsidy form three times year.

The Government has abolished an array of key bureaucratic burdens including the National Indicator Set; Local Area Agreements; the Comprehensive Area Assessment; the £5 million Place Survey and 66 pages of guidance on how to report efficiency.

Ministers are also putting in place a rigorous 'real time' gateway to prevent the build up of new data burdens on local government throughout the year. Councils will not have to provide anything that is not on the list unless funding is made available.

The Department continues to reduce the overall burden of regulation on businesses too. New measures in the Localism Act planning reforms will result in estimated benefits to businesses of £14 million per year.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""For too long central government has kept Town Halls hunched over desks crunching numbers or wielding clipboards asking the public intrusive questions.
> 
> ""We know councils are most effective when they are free to innovate and respond to what local people want without undue interference from Whitehall.
> 
> ""That is why we are chopping great chunks of pointless red tape out of the system - radically reducing the demands, burdens and restrictions put on Town Halls by central government. In next to no time at all we have scaled this back more than a quarter.
> 
> ""But we are not stopping there - business and communities deserve much less interference from government and we remain determined to push as hard as we can and crack down on unnecessary red tape and regulation anywhere we find it.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1777395,Reform of Homes and Communities Agency unveiled,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) Chief Executive Pat Ritchie today announced plans to transform the HCA into a smaller enabling body working for local communities on their priorities.

This is part of the Government's programme to make quangos more accountable to the public and cut their running costs. It represents the start of an ongoing process.

Today's statement follows a review of the role of the HCA as part of the Spending Review process. They will lead to a reduction in its running costs by half over two years, saving the taxpayer over £100m by 2014-15.

Key elements of the plans, which will be delivered within the CSR period, include:

  * a 50 per cent reduction in HCA running costs from over £80m per year to around £40m per year
  * reducing the number of HCA Directors from 12 to six, with the potential to reduce this further over time
  * a reduction from 17 to four core HCA offices, with locations to be finalised as HCA work within the broader DCLG and public sector estate rationalisation programme.

Despite the very tight fiscal climate, the Government has demonstrated its strong commitment to housing and regeneration. £6.5bn will be invested in housing including over £2bn to make existing social homes decent; £4.5bn to fund new affordable homes, including the new Affordable Rent tenure; and a further £1.4bn invested in communities through the Regional Growth Fund, over the Spending Review period.

HCA is working in collaboration with the Department as the detailed design of these new programmes is worked up. Consultation with partners will get underway in earnest from the New Year. In addition, plans are being developed for the Agency to hand over its functions in London to the Mayor, and to take on the remaining responsibilities of the Tenant Services Authority, which is being abolished.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We are committed to building more affordable homes and regenerating local communities. The HCA will play a vital role in delivering this radical agenda, but with a new working ethos of communities in charge, drawing on the expertise that the HCA has to help them achieve their priorities. The plans we are announcing today will enable local communities to do just that - while also saving the taxpayer over £100m.
> 
> ""Like all areas of the public sector, the changes I am announcing today mark the start of a process, not the end. HCA will need to remain flexible to deal with new challenges that will continue to emerge in the coming months and years.""

Pat Ritchie, HCA Chief Executive  said:

> ""Government has given the HCA an important role in meeting the housing and regeneration priorities of local authorities and communities, and in regulating the housing sector to command lender confidence and protect the taxpayer. We have therefore created a top structure with a strong local focus that will provide effective leadership and engagement with local partners while saving money. Further changes will flow from this top structure, maximising the potential of our expertise and investment to help local authorities achieve ambitions for their own areas.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1865652,Reforms to quangos will deliver millions in savings,"The Department for Communities and Local Government's plan to increase accountability by reducing and reforming its quangos is on course to deliver around £170 million savings Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

To coincide with the Government's response to the Public Administration Select Committee's report, the Department is taking the opportunity to update on its own reforms for scaling back its Arms Length Bodies and reducing the running costs of those that remain.

DCLG is reducing the number of departmental Arms Length Bodies from twenty-six to nine. The remaining bodies are putting in place measures to increase efficiency including securing better value for money when buying goods and services and reducing running costs wherever possible. Taken together, it is anticipated that around £170 million will be saved from DCLG's budgets by 2014-15 with a further £60 million saved from the budget for Local Government spending.

Table: DCLG Budgets

Table: Local Government Budgets

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""We are scaling back the quango state, increasing accountability over decision making and in the process saving the taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds. By streamlining the layers of bureaucracy we will not only make government more effective but also more efficient.""

It has been estimated that the disbanding of the Audit Commission will save the taxpayer over £50 million a year. This will include saving the central and corporate costs of the Audit Commission, currently paid for by the Commission's fees including a surcharge on audits, including those by private firms. In addition, councils will be able to appoint their own independent external auditors from a more competitive and open market among audit firms, reducing costs.

In July last year the Department for Communities and Local Government announced the closure of the eight Government Offices for the regions across England. The measures are central to the Government's wider aims of transferring power from central government to councils and communities and the closure is expected to deliver savings of up to £200 million over the spending review period. These figures are in addition to the anticipated savings from the Arms Length Body reforms.

As well as changes to Departmental quangos DCLG is also committed to cutting out waste, reducing overheads and increasing efficiency at the centre.

The commitment to saving taxpayers money is supported by the monthly publishing of all spending over £500 online monthly. This is helping to ensure that both the Department and its quangos operate as transparently and economically as possible.

### Notes to editors

1. The Department is reducing the number of Arms Length Bodies from twenty-six to nine. Each body was considered individually with the Government considering the arguments in each case for retaining or abolishing the body.

2. The four Non Departmental Public Bodies wound up in 2010 were:

  * National Tenant Voice and the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit (these are both shown in the table as abolition will result in a saving over the spending period)
  * Advisory Panel on Standards for the Planning Inspectorate and Local Innovation Advisory Panel (which are not shown in the table as there are no costs or savings attached to these)(1).

None of the four required any legislation and were wound up by way of administrative action alone.

3. There are a further 12 bodies which we expect to be either abolished or transferred by April 2012. One body, the Leasehold Advisory Service remains under review which will report in April 2011.

4. The tables do not include the Audit Commission(1). The Government announced in August plans to disband the Audit Commission and move the work of its in-house audit practice into the private sector. The disbanding of the Commission will require legislation, which the Government will introduce at the earliest opportunity. Savings in the period to 2014-15 will depend on the timing of this legislation and the detail of the new local audit framework, on which we will shortly be consulting.

5. The Planning Inspectorate(1) is not included. As an Executive Agency, it is not within the scope of the Cabinet Office's Public Bodies Review and budgets are still in the process of being agreed.

6. Further detail on savings relating to individual Arms Length Bodies can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/xls/1865595.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/xls/1865595.xls) (MS Excel, 50 kb).

7. As part of a general drive to ensure value for taxpayers money, Ministers have also instructed all Department quangos to cancel their contracts with lobbying firms. This has resulted in Ordnance Survey and the Tenants Services Authority cancelling their contracts. The Audit Commission's lobbying contract ended in February 2010. Ministers believe that using taxpayers' funds on local government campaigns or to lobby government wastes public money as it gets used beyond the local area; public policy is weakened when conducted by private lobbying firms.

8. The Cabinet Office is today publishing, for the first time, estimates of the total savings achieved by the Government through the closure and reform of its public bodies. Detail can be found on the Cabinet Office website: [www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk) (external link).

9. These figures are estimates based on the administration budgets for running costs and restructuring for the Arms Length Bodies. They are subject to change as estimates on costs become firm. Calculation of savings follows HM Treasury guidance methodology and uses updated GDP Deflators post SR10 settlement. These savings figures are not directly comparable to savings figures from the SR10 announcement in October. These figures do not include potential pension crystallisation costs.

10. The Valuation Office Agency is an Executive Agency of HM Revenue and Customs. The funding in the table is provided by DCLG for work on Business Rates and Council Tax valuations.

(1) In addition to the bodies mentioned above, the remaining bodies not shown in the table are the self funding bodies - the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre; the Fire Service College; Ordnance Survey; the Architects Registration Board, and the Independent Housing Ombudsman.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1662245,Replacing bureaucratic accountability with democratic accountability,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles pledges to end a culture of paper chasing as the Department for Communities and Local Government publishes latest performance and spending data for 2009/10.

The data relates to the performance of the previous administration. The data assesses the performance of the Department against 52 indicators on a wide range of measures. Of these 21 targets were on track to be met, 7 were deemed to be off track, 12 at risk, 1 not met and 11 were partially or wholly not yet assessed.

The Communities Secretary believes that this way of assessing and reporting on performance is overcomplicated and does little to help deliver on issues that matter to the public. As part of broader sweeping measures to remove swathes of centralising diktats and cut red tape Ministers are introducing improved systems for informing the public about the work and performance of the Department.

The Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Complex, ever shifting targets and paper chasing hasn't built homes or created a fairer planning system. For too long those tasked with working for the public have been tied up by red tape that has stifled innovation in favour of indicators.
> 
> ""We are moving away from bureaucratic accountability to democratic accountability. We are doing away with endless box ticking. We want civil servants to spend less time form filling and more time just getting on with the job.
> 
> ""Fifty something targets and objectives have been replaced by a clear and simple plan. We have set out what this Department is all about and what it is going to do and we will be accountable for delivering that to the people, not the Government machine.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1714388,Repossessions hit two-year low,"The number of home repossessions have hit a two-year low, according to new figures published today.

The Financial Services Authority report there were 9,978 repossessions between April and June this year - five per cent lower than the previous quarter and the lowest since the first quarter of 2008.

The number of new cases of households in arrears has also continued to fall - there were 37,200 new cases between April and June this year, eight per cent lower than the first three months of 2010 and 27 per cent lower than the same period in 2009.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I am encouraged by the fall in repossessions reported today by the Financial Services Authority. But with nearly 10,000 homeowners losing their homes over the past three months, I would urge all those with mortgage worries to seek early advice and speak to their lenders, and would expect lenders to have exhausted every possible option to help their customers before seeking repossession.

> ""Free help is available either online at [www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp](http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp) (external link), or from organisations like Shelter and Citizens Advice. And for anyone facing the real and frightening prospect of repossession, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme and Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme remain available as a last resort.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1601672,Reprieve for businesses as 'unfair' ports tax frozen,"Many companies in ports across England will get a respite from their business rates bills as Government put a halt to demands for backdated charges.

In 2008 the way business rates are calculated was changed. This meant that many port-based companies received large backdated bills, with some charges running to millions of pounds.

The payment freeze announced by Communities Secretary of State Eric Pickles and Local Government Minister Bob Neill offers a respite for ports companies. The Government will continue to explore options to offer permanent relief from backdated bills.

### Millions of pounds in unexpected bills

Many businesses across the country have faced huge rises in their bills.

  * A Liverpool based company faced a 400 per cent increase in its rates bill, with a demand for an extra backdated £2.6 million.
  * A firm in Grimsby had a rates increase from £48,000, the normal business rate, to £800,000.
  * A Sheerness based importer's retrospective rates bill was £3m.

### ""Immediate help""

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Backdated port taxes levied on a vital part of Britain's export industry have left many businesses unfairly facing hefty bills, reaching into the millions in some cases.
> 
> ""Today I am introducing a suspension of the collection of this ports tax grab, offering immediate help to firms struggling because of this unfair, unjust tax.
> 
> ""I will not allow Government to idly look on any longer as vital businesses stare into the face of insolvency as a result of the ports tax, and today we're making good on our promise to act.
> 
> ""We are clear we should be supporting the economy not forcing people out of business.""

Local Government Minister Bob Neill added:

> ""It is vital to the nation that we set things right and stop this nonsensical situation affecting the livelihoods of thousands.
> 
> ""This payments freeze is an urgent first step that will mean struggling firms have one less thing to worry about in these difficult times, and we will continue to work towards a sensible and fair long term solution.""

### The toll of backdated rates

Below are the rateable values for some of England's major ports areas:

  * Hull: £8.56 million for 62 business properties

  * Liverpool: £8.4 million for 91 business properties

  * Tilbury: £5.25 million for 42 properties

  * Sheerness: £4.8 million for 59 business properties

  * Goole: £2.7 million for 58 business properties

  * Immingham: £6.4 million for 44 properties

  * Grimsby: £1.79 million for 17 properties

  * Bristol: £849,000 for 7 business properties

  * Tyne: £396,000 for 19 properties

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1804892,Residents can now see where council funding goes,"As part of the Government's commitment to transparency, ministers have today taken steps to de-mystify the complex formula grant funding system by publishing further analysis of the way in which central government funding will be distributed per resident around country.

Last week a plain English guide to the provisional Local Government settlement was published alongside a series of spreadsheets, formulas and figures to assist people who understandably may not know their formula grant from their damping floor. 'A Plain English Guide to the Local Government Finance Settlement for 2011-12' is available here [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf).

Ministers have today published the results of a ready reckoner on local government finance that shows how much money is being allocated per head per council. These figures have been mapped to show at a glance how the £21.5 billion of central taxpayer funding for local government is distributed around the country.

![](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1804775)

The data makes it easy to see how much money is being made available for every individual in any given area in England. It shows is that those areas of the country that are most dependant on central government funding are receiving the lion's share of the money that is available. The figures also underline the fact that the settlement is fair between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""When it comes to the way local government budgets are allocated it is not the technicalities taxpayers care about. What they want to know is how much money their council is receiving and what that means in terms of cash per person.
> 
> ""The formula for working out local government finance runs to 152 pages. Getting information out in more accessible formats is about simplifying this complex but important process so that taxpayers can see where their money is going.
> 
> ""What the data shows is that funding fairness underpins this settlement. The settlement is fair between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire.
> 
> ""By adopting an intelligent and fair approach to the way funding is allocated we are getting formula grant to where it is needed most. We have been able to ensure those parts of the country that are most reliant on central funding continue to get the lion's share of the taxpayers' money that is available.""

### Notes to editors

1. The data published today shows that average formula grant funding per head in 2011-12 is £559.36.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1886903,Residents go compare: who pays for local government,"As part of the Government's commitment to transparency, Ministers have today published new figures showing exactly who pays for local government services. A new council tax 'heat map' shows how each resident in different parts of the country contributes in council tax, and how much they conversely receive in central government grant.

This new analysis makes it possible to compare how much councils get in formula grant and council tax per person in each area of the country. This analysis is another step towards de-mystifying the council finance system for residents.

  * The figures show that London and the South contribute the most in council tax, with the most affluent areas paying the highest council tax per head. As a whole, this is not due to the individual budget decisions of the councils, but because the council tax system taxes the richest homes and wealthiest homes the most. Residents in the leafy suburb of Richmond-on-Thames fork out the most per head - £775 - followed by Chiltern, South Bucks, Elmbridge and East Dorset.
  * Two of the main sources of council revenue are through a complex central government formula grant system and through council tax, which accounts for quarter of all revenue. Council tax varies according to the property values of each area - with more affluent areas and bigger homes paying more.
  * The Government has ruled out a council tax revaluation in this Parliament, as it could have meant soaring bills for millions for homes. In the 2005 revaluation in Wales, four times as many homes moved up one of more bands as down.
  * February's Local Government Finance Settlement was structured so areas most dependant on formula grant received the lion's share of that central government funding while those collecting more council tax tended to receive less. This creates a fairer system between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""These new figures allow residents to go compare and see who really pays for local services. No one likes paying council tax, given it doubled since 1997. But the richest and most affluent areas of middle England already pay the highest council tax.
> 
> ""The new Government has cancelled a council tax revaluation because it would mean soaring council tax bills for millions of homes across middle England. Instead, we've frozen council tax - offering real help with the cost of living to young workers, families and pensioners.
> 
> ""Despite the need to pay off the budget deficit, the new Government has ensured fairness for all parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire.""

### Notes to Editors

1. Figures published show how the £26.5 billion of council tax requirement collected around the country is distributed per head of population. The national average is £511.

  * A table showing average council tax per head for 2011-12 can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/1886330.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/1886330.xls)

2. The ten councils which contribute the most council tax per head are all in London or the South, and in order:

  * Richmond upon Thames (£755 per head)
  * Chiltern (£734)
  * South Bucks (£734)
  * Elmbridge (£729)
  * East Dorset (£722)
  * West Dorset (£717)
  * Purbeck (£716)
  * Wealden (£716)
  * Mole Valley (£713)
  * Christchurch (£705)

3. Unlike the old rates and poll tax, council tax is a local services tax based on a banded system.

4. Council tax per head is primarily a reflection of property values and the distribution of central government grant. To compare the tax and spending decisions of individual councils, one should contrast the average Band D per household council tax rates of each council. This is since homes in areas with lower property values have lower council tax banding and a smaller 'taxbase'. Band D however allows for council-by-council comparisons on councils' individual budget decisions.

5. A second set of figures show how the £29.4 billion of central taxpayer funding for local government distributed around the country is allocated per head for each council. The national average is £559.

  * A table showing formula grant funding per head for 2011-12 can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/1804766.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/1804766.xls)

6. One new source of income for councils this year is a central government grant for those freezing council tax. 100 per cent of eligible local authorities have signed up to the scheme, delivering an average Band D freeze across the country. Ministers have agreed to start making the freeze payments, and the first payment is expected shortly.

7. The Spending Review made £650 million available for the council tax freeze. The capping threshold in recent years was a 5 per cent council tax rise. Stopping such a rise this year saves a typical household up to £72 and if an average 2.5 per cent rise had occurred the saving would have been £36.

All eligible local, fire and rescue and police authorities in England have decided to freeze or reduce their Band D council tax in 2011-12 and will therefore all be eligible to receive the additional grant offered by the Government for doing so. The average Band D rate of council tax will remain at £1,439 - a change of zero per cent. As a result each council will receive a grant equivalent to a 2.5 per cent increase in its 2010-11 Band D figure multiplied by its 2011-12 tax base figure.  Details of the individual grants can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/1872076.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/1872076.xls).

8. The Government ruled out a council tax revaluation in England in this Parliament on 24 September 2010. [www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1723934](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1723934).

9. Parish councils were not covered by the council tax freeze scheme, so bills in some areas may show small increases in cash terms due to parish precept increases.

10. A plain English guide to the Finance Settlement that cuts through the jargon is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/1796186.pdf).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1897066,Residents pool together to save community baths,"Derbyshire has got its first new swimming pool for 25 years thanks to the actions of some community minded locals. Gayton pool opened in January 2011 after residents in Littleover campaigned to keep their local pool open. The result was a new £1 million pool which has enabled local residents and children to benefit from a range of swimming lessons.

The success of Gayton pool demonstrates what can happen when communities come together and take over the running of a service from the local authority. The Localism Bill will give communities the right to challenge their council on decisions that directly affect them and enable local residents to take charge of their community to run services themselves.

Built and paid for in the 1970s the original pool was closed in 2007 after years of neglect and a lack of funds to pay for vital maintenance costs.

In response, local residents set up the Blagreaves Community Action Group. Gayton Community Association, who had a hand in the original building of the pool, launched a legal challenge against the council, claiming that the building's lease obliged the authority to take action.

The dedication of local residents, some of whom even remortgaged their homes to raise enough funds to take the case to court, paid off as the association won the case. This resulted in the council demolishing the old pool and building a brand new one.

### Community controlled

Operation of the pool is now community based as Gayton Pool Limited, a subsidiary of Lonsdale Swimming and Sports Trust, has won a five year contract to run and manage the pool on behalf of the council.

Ian Cotter, Chairman, Lonsdale Swimming and Sports Trust and Managing Director of Gayton Pool Limited explained how the new pool was already making a difference to the local community; 

> ""The new Gayton pool is a marvellous facility for the local community and will enable many more to learn to swim and take part in water activities.
> 
> ""The main focus at Gayton will be on swimming lessons and schools use. We have been operating the pool now for 3 months and we have over 400 children learning to swim every week amongst the 800 people who are using it. Those who campaigned hard for the pool can now see the fruits of their labours in the success of it at such an early stage.""

The pool has made a splash in the local community and has proved to be a resounding success, offering a range of swimming lessons for adults and children, aqua fit classes, family sessions and splash parties.

Gayton Community Association have shown the positive outcomes that can be achieved when a community challenges their council on the decisions that directly affect them.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1934868,Residents stamp their authority on local post office,"Residents in Darnall, Sheffield, have benefited from the country's first charity run Post Office after their convenient and well-used local facility unexpectedly closed in August 2009.

Fortunately, the Darnall Forum, a local charity run by residents, stepped in to ensure that this crucial service was not lost and the Post Office re-opened just a year later.

### See how they did it

Watch the video below to find out more about how they did it and what the Post Office means to the local community.

![embed: ](http://www.youtube.com/v/yDX1KUC_PYo?version=3&hl=en_GB&showinfo=0;rel=0)

The success of the Post Office has left local residents thrilled and shows what can happen when a community group takes over the running of a service from a national institution. The [Community Right to Challenge](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1934868) is a key element of the government's Localism Bill which can assist with this. By giving community or voluntary sector organisations new powers to challenge and take over the running of a local service, such groups can be at the forefront of their community.

The new Post Office was opened after the Darnall Forum's members, working on behalf of the wider community, talked to their MP and local councillors to do everything they could to finally reach an agreement with the Post Office.

The project was also aided by a £10,000 start-up grant provided by Sheffield City Council and a £40,000 loan from Key Fund Yorkshire, which supports social enterprise initiatives across the local area. All profits from the charity run Post Office will go back into Darnall Forum's other community projects such as employment and training initiatives. Through a new scheme being promoted across Sheffield the Post Office has even started to offer services such as allowing people to pay their council tax and housing rent at the branch.

The hard work and dedication of the Darnall Forum shows what can be achieved when a community works together to ensure that local services are still first class.

The Green Belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest continue to be protected, and for other areas it is for local councils to decide what areas should be included in their plans for development - exactly as it is at the moment, with the exception that local councils' views cannot be counter-manded by the previous government's unelected regional assemblies.

In addition, recognising that not all valued green space is within the countryside, we are creating a new designation to protect local green spaces of particular importance to local communities. Further, ancient woodlands continue to have robust protection in our revised framework.

The Coalition Government has no intention of weakening its commitment to the Green Belt (""Planning rules pave the way for Green Belt housing bonanza"", 1 July 2011).

The Coalition Agreement explicitly states that we will maintain Green Belt protection. The Green Belt has a valuable role in stopping urban sprawl and providing a green lung around towns and cities.

Indeed, our planned abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies will stop the top-down removal of the Green Belt in thirty areas across England.

What we are doing is consolidating and condensing the thousand pages of Whitehall planning policy guidance into one clear, short document.

This clearer framework will allow for the creation of the new homes, jobs, and businesses people want, while at the same time safeguarding the protection of our green spaces for current and future generations.

Reform of the planning system is essential, but it won't be at the expense of the environment.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

By lumping together statistics on the evictions of homeowners, social tenants and private tenants your article (March of the Bailiffs, Monday 30 January) painted an inaccurate and misleading representation, which overlooks how Government action is ensuring struggling households get the support they need.

The numbers of mortgage repossessions are expected to be lower than the Council of Mortgage Lenders' original forecast of 40,000 for 2011 - also lower than the rate inherited from the previous Government.

We are committed to ensuring real help, support and advice is available to help ensure that even in tough times repossession remains the last resort. We have taken decisive action to tackle the record deficit we inherited, preventing the need for rapid increases in interest rates that would have put a strain on family budgets. We've maintained £400million preventing homelessness funding and put a further £200million towards the Mortgage Rescue Scheme.

I would urge anyone struggling to pay their mortgage to seek help as early as possible. The Directgov website as well as organisations such as Citizens Advice, Shelter and National Debtline are on hand to offer the advice and information that can help put people in the best possible position to keep their homes.

Alex Welsh should be reassured that strong planning protections will safeguard London's playing fields ('We need to safeguard London's playing fields or suffer the consequences', 6 October 2011).

Communities will have new powers to protect green spaces special to them thanks to a new Local Green Spaces designation which can be used to protect playing fields, allotments, community gardens and other recreational spaces. And we are increasing planning protections for valued community facilities to save them from unnecessary loss.

The Government is also maintaining protection for the Green Belt, and the Mayor and London Boroughs will continue to be able to safeguard Metropolitan Open Land.

The planning reforms ensure communities are central to deciding the areas they wish to see developed and those to be protected, through their Local Plan.  It is these plans that will drive planning decisions.

We desperately need to bring about new homes and jobs but this will not be at the expense of our green spaces.  Making sure people can go on enjoying their local amenities is at the heart of the changes.

I have made clear that current and former members of the armed forces will now, for the first time, be prioritised for FirstBuy and other Government low cost home ownership schemes.

In fact our special FirstBuy housing agents are already deployed to assist with applications from army barracks both at home and abroad.

Next, I recently held a Military Covenant Housing Summit where we resolved to fix several problems which have led to military personnel being unable to build up a credit record. In addition I have since said that we will consult on how to push ex-squaddies to a prime position on the housing waiting lists.

Finally, this Coalition Government aims to deliver a net increase in Affordable Homes each and every year with our £4.5bn building programme.

Here are five facts showing why these claims are wrong.

**Fact one:** Strong protections remain in place in the draft Framework to protect the Green Belt, countryside and other green spaces valued by communities from unacceptable development. The Government is removing the pressure on councils to build on the Green Belt by scrapping regional strategies which imposed top down targets on local areas.

**Fact two:** Development is encouraged on brownfield land in the draft Framework. It states that 'plans should allocate land with the least environmental or amenity value', which means choosing derelict land when considering where to develop.

**Fact three:** Local people will be in charge of decisions on which development proposals to accept and which areas to protect through their Local Plans. Under the previous system these plans could be overridden by the instructions of regional agencies.

**Fact four:** The presumption is not a green light for development. All proposals will need to demonstrate their sustainability and be in line with the strict environmental protections in the draft Framework.

**Fact five:** The draft framework is not new legislation; it will only become national policy after the consultation period, when a final text, taking account of responses, will be published. Inspectors have not been instructed to use the framework when considering planning appeals. Ministers and the inspectorate  are clear that the framework is a draft.

Dear Sir,

The IPPR's proposals just don't stack up. It seems they've missed the fundamental point of the Housing Strategy which is designed to get much better value for money. As a result we will push developers and builders harder than ever before to play their part to deliver new homes quickly, securing excellent value for each taxpayer's pound.

For example, our new Affordable Housing programme will cost the taxpayer far less per home by stretching builders and housing associations to contribute on average 25 per cent more towards the costs. And we are also getting far better value for money through the Get Britain Building fund than under the previous government's Kickstart programme.  
   
Taken together these new measures will support and help smaller builders to expand, create thousands of new jobs and re-invigorate the housing market.

This assertion is based on a factually inaccurate analysis of the spending over £500 that the Department now publishes as part of its commitment to transparency.

A spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""It is completely untrue to suggest that millions have been spent on consultants since the change in administration. Several of the figures quoted are incorrect, refer to spending under the previous administration or have been incorrectly entered as consultancy. The Department is implementing a programme to reduce this year's running costs by £50 million, as part of an overall budget reduction of £780 million for the department announced in May last year.""

The Local Government Chronicle makes a series of claims based on spending items. These are taken in turn and refuted or explained below.

LGC claims:

> Spending data published by DCLG for the period from May-December 2010 shows a sharp spike in spending on finance consultancy, up from just £1,678 in May-June and £839 in July-August to £704k in the in final quarter of 2010. This compares to a total spend of £868k over the whole of 2009-10.

The reality is:

> The spike in spending of £704k in the last quarter of 2010 can be attributed to a payment of £700,000 made to HM Treasury, which had been incorrectly coded as Finance Consultancy.

LGC claims:

> The Communities Secretary has also overseen a nearly £1m bill for Human Resource consultancy over the period May-Dec, compared to a total spend of just £110k in all of 2009-10.

The reality is:

> This figure bears no relation to the published data. Entries listed as HR consultancy on the departments spending tables totals around £150k for the period May - Dec 2010.

LGC claims:

> The cost of IT consultancy has also risen since May, up from £240k in May-June to £674k in July-Aug, followed by a huge bill of £2.8m in the final quarter.

The reality:

> The spend in the final quarter of £2.8m can be mainly attributed to two areas. £1.5m was paid to the Tenant Services Authority in November, this was not for IT consultancy and this information has been incorrectly coded. Approximately £1m of the remaining spend can be attributed to spend with Mott MacDonald, who provide Technical support and project Management to the Firelink project and FireControl - an overbudget and now terminated programme from the last administration.

LGC claims:

> Legal costs have also risen steadily since Mr Pickles entered Eland House, with a £404k bill in May-June rising to £545k in July-Aug, which rose again to £747k in Oct-Dec.

The reality:

> The new Government inherited over 200 ongoing legal issues from the last administration and the legal spend compares to a comparable spend of £4.8 million in 2009-10.

LGC claims:

> And despite housing minister Grant Shapps criticising the Audit Commission for spending £53k on office chairs, DCLG has spent £73k on office furniture since May, including £40k on luxury Herman Miller desks and chairs.

The reality is:

> These are costs associated with the refurbishment of the Department following a rationalisation of buildings from 2 to 1 that was overseen and implemented in the period of the previous administration. These particular chairs were ordered before May with payments being made at a later date.

LGC claims:

> The Department has also spent £9,198 on excess fares since May, charged against travel on trains without a valid ticket.

The reality is:

> This spending entry does not relate to travelling without a valid ticket.

In other areas Mr Pickles has overseen sharp decreases in spending, including advertising and publicity, down from £563k in July-August to £72k in Oct-Dec, while the department's mobile phone bills have fallen from £28k in May-June to just £1,159 in Oct- Dec.

These reductions in spending are part of a much wider effort right across the department to drive down costs.  To cut our in-year running costs we have:

  * implemented a recruitment freeze, reduced bonuses and used fewer agency and interim staff, delivering £3.9 million savings
  * reduced our spending on accommodation, IT and training - delivering £2.8 million savings
  * cut down the number of external conferences, as well the cost of consultants and other corporate running costs - delivering £3.7 million savings.

In addition to this we have saved £18 million from the Department's central programme budgets - by bearing down on marketing and research budgets - and our QUANGOs are delivering savings of £23 million.

So, taken together what the figures actually show is that the claim:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1784155,Returning respect and pride to town planning,"Town planners have become a lightning rod for people's sense of frustration with the current planning system, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said today.

Mr Clark said planners were in one sense the first victims of a top down system that has curtailed their use of professional discretion and marginalised them as ""agents of imposition"" in the eyes of local communities.

New radical reforms to the planning system to be included in Localism Bill will fundamentally change the role of planners so they work for and with the community, helping local people to articulate their vision for their neighbourhood and rightfully restoring respect for the profession, Mr Clark said.

Speaking to the Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA), Mr Clark said:

> ""Planners have an awesomely important job to do, but have had their professional judgement curtailed by endless national and regional prescription and guidance, with too little opportunity for genuine planning. Instead, planners have become a lightning rod for people's sense of frustration with the current system, often being seen as agents of imposition for Whitehall's instructions.
> 
> ""Our proposals will change the role of town planners, freeing them to use their professional skills to help local people articulate their vision for their town or village or neighbourhood, and make it a reality. In doing so neighbourhood planning can help to restore respect for the profession so that it is properly valued, and never reviled.""

Mr Clark told the TCPA that neighbourhood planning being introduced in the Localism Bill, alongside existing plans, would place an unprecedented level of influence and power at a very local level, enabling communities to shape the places they live in.

Every community will have the right to introduce a neighbourhood plan, allowing local people to decide where new shops, offices or homes should go and what green spaces should be protected. If local people then vote in favour of new 'Neighbourhood Plans' in local referendums, councils will have to adopt them.

The new powers will allow communities to be able to confer full planning permission where people are most keen to take control and have certainty over development. In other areas, people will be able to grant outline permission with conditions, for example on design details.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2123185,Revamped Right to Buy is chance of a lifetime for tenants,"### £75,000 discounts will help get tenants across the threshold

A new generation of social tenants were today handed the keys to homeownership, as the Prime Minister and Housing Minister Grant Shapps launched a reinvigorated Right to Buy.

![David Cameron and Grant Shapps talking to Right to Buy applicants.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2124720.jpg)David Cameron and Grant Shapps meet with Right to Buy applicants.

The Prime Minister today gave the green light to offer 2.5 million tenants the opportunity to buy their home with dramatically increased discounts.  
  
Today's move will reverse years of declining discounts for tenants, which made Right to Buy meaningless in many parts of the country. Fewer than 3,700 sales were made last year compared to a peak of 84,000 less than 10 years ago.

#### Tenants informed of new opportunities

Ministers are taking every effort to ensure tenants have the information they need to understand how today's changes could put them in the frame to become homeowners. To help councils fulfil their legal duty to inform tenants, the Government is making a range of materials available to ensure potential buyers are aware of the changes and understand the steps they should take if they decide Right to Buy is the right choice for them.

The Government has moved swiftly to introduce the new discounts, and councils should waste no time getting in touch with their tenants, so as many as possible can take advantage of the scheme and use the discount as a firm foundation for home ownership.

#### Sold homes replaced with new affordable properties

For the first time, the additional homes sold under the revamped scheme will be replaced by new properties for affordable rent, ensuring there is no reduction in the number of affordable homes.  
  
Councils will be able to sign an agreement with Government for using the receipts from sales to build new affordable homes in their area. The receipts will be expected to meet up to 30 per cent of the costs, mirroring the highly successful funding model used for the Affordable Homes Programme, which has exceeded all expectations and will deliver up to 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015.  
   
Prime Minister David Cameron said:

> ""I want many more people to achieve the dream of home ownership. In the 80s, Right to Buy helped millions of people living in council housing achieve their aspiration of owning their own home.  
  
""It gave something back to families who worked hard, paid their rent and played by the rules. It allowed them to do up their home, change their front door, improve their garden - without getting permission from the council. It gave people a sense of pride and ownership not just in their home, but in their street and neighbourhood, helping to build strong families and stable mixed communities.  
  
""But over time the discounts were cut, they didn't keep pace with rises in property prices, and this vital rung on the property ladder was all but removed. This Government is now putting it back by dramatically increasing the discount rates so that we support the dreams of those council tenants who to want to own the roof over their head.""

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""This country was built on aspiration: men and women who looked to the future and resolved to make a better life for themselves and their families. But years of punitive limitations on the level of discounts under Right to Buy have sabotaged the aspirations of hardworking council tenants who want to take their first step on the property ladder.
> 
> ""This Government wants to help everyone achieve their aspirations - so I'm delighted to announce that from today these miserly restrictions on discounts are history, and tenants will once again receive genuine assistance to feel the pride of home ownership.
> 
> ""Tenants who have done well for themselves and want to get across the threshold to home ownership can now expect a discount of up to £75,000 to help them buy the home they live in. Councils must ensure that their tenants are kept properly informed of the new opportunities, and offer a helping hand to those tenants who want to buy their property.
> 
> ""We are also determined to maintain the number of affordable homes for rent and get Britain building again. So for the first time, additional properties that are sold will be replaced by new affordable homes, using the same highly successful model that is already delivering thousands of new affordable homes in every part of the country.""

#### Bigger cash discounts to benefit every part of the country

Thirty years after the original launch of Right to Buy, Ministers believe it can once again promote opportunity and boost social mobility for the nation's social tenants, and at the same time transform housing estates.  
  
From today tenants could benefit from a discount of up to £75,000, depending on how long they have been a tenant.This will mean, for example, that:

  * someone in Birmingham who had been a tenant for fifteen years could buy their £90,000 flat with a discount of £63,000 compared to £26,000 previously - almost trebling their discount; and
  * in London, a tenant for five years buying a flat worth £160,000 would receive a discount of £75,000 - more than four times the previous cap of £16,000.

This enhanced offer includes the half a million Housing Association tenants with a Preserved Right to Buy - because their home was part of a housing stock transfer from a local authority.

Where receipts are not used locally to build new homes they will be passed to the Greater London Authority and the Homes and Communities Agency, who will re-invest the money in new affordable housing across the country.

### Notes to editors

1. The revitalised Right to Buy scheme will give tenants a larger discount on the market value of their home. The longer they have been a tenant, the bigger discount they get, up to a maximum cap of £75,000.

2. For a house, tenants can get a discount of 35 per cent on their current home after five years as a public sector tenant. For each extra year, they get an additional 1 per cent discount up to a maximum of 60 per cent.

3. For flats, tenants can get a discount of 50 per cent, after a five-year tenancy. For each extra year, they get an additional 2 per cent discount up to a maximum of 70 per cent.

4. Whatever percentage they are eligible for, it cannot exceed £75,000. This arrangement will result in far higher potential discounts for tenants across the country - see table below for previous discount limits.

5. Tenants must have been public sector tenants for five years before they can qualify to purchase their home through Right to Buy. This tenancy can be in their current home or in a previous one, with a different landlord.

  
6. The replacement of additional homes bought through Right to Buy will be funded using the same highly successful model as the Affordable Homes programme. Under this approach social landlords can meet the costs of new homes from borrowing against the future rental income, contributing from their own resources, including land, and grant funding from the Government. For the Right to Buy replacement scheme, receipts will substitute for grant funding for up to 30 per cent of total costs.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1866559,Review could end council dependence on Whitehall grant,"A vision of 'self-funded' councils that keep their local business taxes with central grant dependence scaled back except where it is needed to protect the interest of taxpayers is being put forward today by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles.

The first phase of a review of council resources is being launched today to consider ways to establish a new system for Business Rates and Government Grant, which protects the interests of taxpayers, rewards local growth and job creation, and delivers a more self-sufficient income for councils.

At the moment, £20 billion of business rates collected by councils is pooled by central government and redistributed across all local authorities through an extremely complex grant system. As a result the cash return for economically successful councils is curtailed.

Ministers believe that councils' dependence on Whitehall grant has also had a knock on effect on council tax in many local authorities - due to so-called 'gearing'. As a result they want to explore a radical new approach to financing councils that reduces the current dependency on central redistribution for as many authorities as possible because it acts as a disincentive to local growth.

Ministers believe that allowing councils to repatriate their business rates could help introduce genuine local growth incentives for councils, which have a vital economic leadership role in new local enterprise partnerships, to support growth in the private sector and regeneration. Councils would have a direct stake in the future of their area with access to money and growth rewards.

The terms of the review are clear that any change must protect the interests of local taxpayers and the vulnerable, be fair for all councils, and encourage growth. Councils which are more deprived will continue to receive central government support.

The new Government is already acting to protect local taxpayers, by introducing a council tax freeze, scrapping the council tax revaluation, abolishing plans for new bin taxes, and increasing tax relief for small firms and small shops.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said:

> ""We want every community to be open for business and rewarded for economic growth, but at the moment there is no motivation for councils to support local firms or create new jobs. One of the best ways we can change that is to free councils from their enslavement to Government grants and put them in control of their own destiny.
> 
> ""By letting councils repatriate their business rate income you make the system more straightforward and councils more self-sufficient in one fell swoop, whilst deprived councils would still get the support they need. Scaling back central government's historic control and redistribution of this local business tax would also give councils a sudden shot of financial adrenaline and a legitimate stake in their economy with direct benefits for supporting new business and growth. It is what councils want and precisely what we mean by localism.
> 
> ""Localism doesn't mean higher taxes. Indeed, councils' dependency on the whims of Whitehall has had a knock on effect for council tax bills in many areas. But greater local autonomy will require greater local accountability and local transparency to ensure sound finances. We will stand up and protect the interests of local taxpayers, as they've been taken for granted for too long.""

As part of the first phase of the Local Government Resources Review, the Department will conduct extensive engagement with interested parties, including business of all sizes. The Review will conclude in July followed by the necessary steps to implement the conclusions. The Terms of Reference for phase one are published today setting out what will be considered by Ministers. They include:

  * the best way to allow local authorities to retain their business rates to incentive growth, whilst ensuring that all have adequate resources to meet the needs of their communities
  * the extent to which these proposals can set councils free from dependency on central funding, along with further financial freedoms, whilst protecting the interests of local taxpayers
  * to ensure the right safeguards are in place: including how to fund those who collect insufficient business rates and keep control of council tax levels; the position of councils that collect more than current spending levels; and ensure protections for business
  * implications for other policies such as New Homes Bonus, Business Rate Relief and Tax Increment Financing which allows councils to borrow against future revenue.

There will also be a second phase that focuses on the important role of Community Budgets. It will be taken forward in parallel with the continued roll out of these Budgets. Detailed Terms of Reference will be published in due course.

### Notes to editors

1. In agreement with Her Majesty's Treasury the full Terms of Reference for the first phase can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/word/1866550](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/word/1866550.doc) (Word, 28k).

2. The Government remains committed to providing more freedom to local authorities by introducing new borrowing powers against their business rate revenues to carry out Tax Increment Financing. Councils can use that borrowing to fund key infrastructure and other capital projects which will further support local driven economic development and growth.

3. Following the announcements at the Spending Review, and through introduction of the Welfare Reform Bill, that Government will localise Council Tax Benefit, the Review will also consider the design of the new scheme (to be launched in 2013-14) and what flexibilities local authorities should have to help keep overall council tax levels down from that date.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2057871,Review to examine institutional investment in private rented homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today confirmed that Sir Adrian Montague will lead a review of barriers to investment in rented homes.

The Government's Housing Strategy published last month highlighted the range of steps being taken to increase the supply of new homes. 

Sir Adrian's review will examine how best to encourage greater investment in rental properties - helping support the rapid growth of the private rented sector by increasing the supply of affordable homes. Terms of reference can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/pdf/2057113.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/pdf/2057113.pdf)

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""I'm delighted to announce that Sir Adrian Montague will lead the Private Rented Sector review. The sector has seen several years of strong growth and increasing standards, but in some areas rents have begun to rise faster than wages. Over three million households live in privately rented homes, so it's vital that we take steps to ensure the sector's continuing growth and affordability.
> 
> ""Sir Adrian brings with him a wealth of experience and knowledge of the role of the private sector in boosting infrastructure investment and of housing policy, making him an excellent choice to lead the review.""

Sir Adrian said:

> ""I'm honoured to have been chosen to lead the review into the potential for institutional investment in housing. The private rental sector has gone through a period of rapid growth, and it's crucial that the Government does all it can to ensure that demand continues to be met. I aim to help remove barriers to investment, contributing to the continuing health of a sector that millions of people rely on.""

### Notes to editors

Sir Adrian is the non-executive Chairman of 3i, Michael Page International plc, Anglian Water Group Ltd and CellMark Investments AB of Gothenburg, and a non-executive director of Skanksa AB of Stockholm. 

He was a member of the Housing Finance Group established by the Homes and Communities Agency in the wake of the credit crisis, and also chairs an advisory group reporting to Business Secretary Vince Cable on the establishment of a Green Investment Bank.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1794133,Revolutionary new rights for communities will protect and transform local services,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has announced a package of powerful new rights for communities to challenge services and preserve local assets.

The new Community Rights measures are yet another leap towards localism and the decentralisation of power from Whitehall. The Localism Bill, due to be announced on Monday 13 December, will enshrine in law rights for community and voluntary groups to draw on when determining what happens in their local area.

They are:

  * **Community Right to Buy**. Local groups will have a legal right to nominate any vital community asset including local shops, pubs, libraries and leisure centres to be assessed for recording on a 'most wanted' list by the local council. If a listed asset goes on the open market, its sale will be delayed triggering a 'community countdown' that will give people time to prepare their business plan and raise the funds they need to bid.
  * **Community Right to Challenge**. Opening the door to a transformation in the way that local public services are run, Right to Challenge gives community or voluntary sector groups, as well as parish councils and council employees delivering the service, new powers to challenge and take over a local service. This could include running children's centres, social care services and even improving local transport links. Under the new law, councils must respond to this challenge and consider the positive impact the proposal could have on the community. If the proposal is turned down the council must publish the reasons for this. This new right puts voluntary and charity groups on the front foot when it comes to running public services and has the potential to open up new revenue for them.

Mr Pickles also announced new rights for communities to shape the development of the communities in which they live, through the creation of neighbourhood plans. The Localism Bill will radically reform the planning system so local people have a greater say and influence over what their home town will look like in the future.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, said:

> ""This powerful series of measures puts new rights in law for people to protect, improve and even run important frontline services. For too long people have been powerless to intervene as vital community resources disappear from their areas. The Community Rights measures will put control back where it belongs - with the people at the heart of our villages, towns and cities.
> 
> ""The Rights are also a massive opportunity for the community and voluntary sector to demonstrate their innovation and the new ideas they can bring to the table for better, cost effective services.""

Local facilities have been closing down all over the country, leaving towns and villages without vital amenities. Small community groups that are willing to take over local assets often find that they lack the time and resources to get a plan together and compete with the might and muscle of big business and developers, who can throw significant time and resource behind projects.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell, said:

> ""These groundbreaking measures puts communities at the heart of decision making for protecting vital frontline services and puts them on the front foot for putting in an offer if they come up for closure.""

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice, said:

> ""Too many communities are losing the buildings and services that bind them together.  They need new safeguards to ensure community assets don't disappear for the lack of awareness of their value and to provide civic societies and other local groups with the time and capacity needed to develop viable proposals to save them.  Civic Voice welcomes the steps being taken in the Localism Bill to give communities new rights to help save the assets that matter to them.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1641232,Rough sleeping hits 11-year low,"The numbers of rough sleepers in England has hit an eleven-year low, according to figures published today.

In total, 70 councils conducted street counts and reported that there were 440 rough sleepers in England on any given night.  In comparison, in 2009 76 councils conducted street counts and recorded 464 rough sleepers.

### Street Count Methodology

Housing Minister Grant Shapps has said he is sceptical of the methodology behind the street counts - currently, only councils considered to have a problem with rough sleeping have been required to conduct a count.

So he will shortly consult on plans for a complete overhaul on the means of counting rough sleepers, to give councils and charities a credible measure that truly reflects the situation on the streets.

He said:

> ""Today's figures show that rough sleeping is at an eleven-year low - but I am sceptical that these figures reflect the situation on the streets.
> 
> ""Only councils considered to have a rough sleeping problem have been required to conduct counts - so in some of our biggest cities, while local people would be acutely aware of the problem of rough sleeping, official street counts were not conducted.
> 
> ""That's why I will shortly publish plans for a complete overhaul of the way the problem of rough sleeping is assessed so councils and charities can be given a credible measure of the problem in their area.""

A long-term campaigner for the homeless, the Minister has confirmed that he will do all he can to safeguard homelessness funding in the face of tough economic times. Already, in-year savings of £6.2bn across Whitehall and the emergency Budget outlining further measures to cut the deficit, Government funding for tackling homelessness has remained unchanged.

Mr Shapps also chairs a cross-departmental group of ministers from eight different Government departments, working together to see how the policies for which they have responsibility can help address the complex problems that cause people to lose their home.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1912431,Royal wedding sparks street party fever for the Big Lunch,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today revealed new figures showing that the Royal Wedding has sparked 'street party fever' with a 280 per cent surge in registrations for the national Big Lunch a week today (5th June).

The occasion of the Royal Wedding - watched by millions across the globe - brought people together to celebrate a shared sense of Britishness and community spirit. Thousands of people came together to celebrate the Royal Wedding with parties in streets, gardens, parks and community centres. This was supported by Government action to sweep away red tape and bureaucracy, resulting in over 5,500 people submitting road closure requests.

Mr Pickles is reminding councils that national events like the Royal Wedding, Big Lunch and next year's Diamond Jubilee bring communities together, and is urging them not to spoil the fun with unnecessary bureaucracy. He wants communities to break out the bunting, not get tied up in red tape.

Applications for Big Lunch street parties have doubled since the royal wedding, with the North East region receiving the highest number of registrations since April - a surge of 281 per cent. Londoners are keeping the party going with nearly 700 street parties registered with the Big Lunch website - an increase of 150 per cent since the Royal Wedding. Other party hot spots include the Manchester area (225 registered street parties), Birmingham (201 registrations) and Bristol (146 registrations).

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, said:

> ""What the Royal Wedding showed is that community spirit is not a thing of the past. Street party fever is thriving and the Big Lunch is another chance for people to dust off their bunting, get together with friends and neighbours and grow, bake, buy and eat together.""
> 
> ""Big Lunch is a great idea and a great opportunity for councils to help residents forge strong community links. I want to remind them not to spoil the fun with red tape and bureaucracy. People shouldn't have to fight for their right to street party.""

Jason Pollock, The Big Lunch Campaign Director said:

> ""Our research shows that after taking part in a neighbourhood event for The Big Lunch last year, 79 per cent of people said that they felt better about where they lived and 95 per cent still feel closer to their neighbours a year later.
> 
> ""What's more, we know that they keep in touch, lend each other a hand and plan future events together. The royal wedding appears to have given The Big Lunch a huge boost. From Plymouth to Aberdeen, Londonderry to Norwich, we've already got more events registered this year compared to this time in 2010 and we still have over a month to go.""

The Government is reminding councils that the process for organising a street party needn't be bureaucratic and is urging councils not to spoil the fun with pointless red tape.

Measures the government has taken include reminding councils that:

  * road closure charges can be waived - there is no requirement at all for closures on small roads and councils can provide advice on traffic management

  * public liability insurance is not always necessary - Prime Minister David Cameron recently announced it is no longer a requirement for small street parties to hold insurance. Councils can advise further on individual circumstances.

With support and advice from Streets Alive many councils and communities have been able to bust these myths and take a common sense approach.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Chief Executive of Rutland County Council, Helen Briggs said:

> ""We are very proud that the Rutland flag is being flown outside the Department for Communities and Local Government in London.
> 
> ""Rutland may be the smallest county in the country but has much to share and offer, not least the fantastic reservoir and nature reserve Rutland Water, an array of unspoilt villages and two attractive market towns packed with charm, history and culture.
> 
> ""Rich in history and full of character, Rutland offers a taste of traditional England. Undiscovered by many and treasured by a lucky few our proudly independent county has celebrated over a decade of independence.
> 
> ""To this day, Rutland remains one of the most charming, proud and attractive rural counties in England. We very much welcome this opportunity to raise Rutland's profile and encourage people to come and visit to see what we have to offer.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1698778,Safe rooms help stop domestic violence victims becoming homeless,"New research and statistics published today show that whilst domestic violence is one the major reasons families become homeless, protection measures such as safe rooms are very effective in helping these families to safely stay in their homes.

Under what are known as 'Sanctuary Schemes', victims of domestic violence have special security measures installed to keep families safe in their own homes in case the aggressor tries to return. Depending on the specific needs of the family at risk, this might mean creating a safe room in the house which is secured using a reinforced door which opens outwards so an intruder can't kick-it in. 

In other cases, councils and the police might install video entry systems and alarms which automatically alert the nearest police station ensuring a rapid response. These security measures combined with other essential support from specialist domestic violence service providers have proved crucial in keeping households safe.

The research by the University of York shows that Sanctuary Schemes, supported by other agencies, such as the police and local councils, have been hugely successful in helping families stay safe in their own homes. This often means families avoid the upheaval of having to leave their home and support networks and the risk of becoming homeless.

Statistics also released today show that in 2009 there were over 5,000 cases that were prevented from becoming homeless home thanks to the protection of a sanctuary scheme.

As a result, new guidance has also been published to help councils, the police and other partners make sure that the Sanctuary Schemes they run best meet the needs of domestic violence victims.

Welcoming the research and guidance Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""No one should be driven from their home and left homeless because of a violent family member. This research shows that the effective and practical help Sanctuary Schemes provide can help stop victims of domestic violence becoming victims of homelessness too.
> 
> ""By providing at risk families with the support and safety measures they need, we can help them avoid the upheaval of having to leave their homes and support networks and help them get their lives back on track.
> 
> ""What matters is what works and that's why I'm bringing together Ministers from 8 different Government departments so that we can make sure that in areas such as domestic violence, we're working together across different public services to find the best practical solutions for people.""

The new research has been welcomed by prominent domestic violence organisations Women's Aid and AVA (Against Violence and Abuse).

Chief Executive for Women's Aid, Nicola Harwin CBE, said:

> ""Women's Aid warmly welcomes the findings and recommendations of the research, as we know that Sanctuary Schemes can provide practical protection for survivors of domestic violence who wish to remain in their own homes. However, this needs to be offered together with other options including alternatives such as refuge accommodation and risk assessments need to take place in every case to decide if a Sanctuary Scheme is appropriate and safe.
> 
> ""With two women being killed every week in England and Wales by their partner or ex-partner, it is vital that the safety of the abused woman and any children must remain the absolute priority at all times.""

Director of Against Violence and Abuse, Davina James-Hanman said:

> ""AVA very much welcomes this research which provides us much needed national data on sanctuary schemes. More importantly, we hope the findings will demonstrate to those local authorities that are not currently offering this service that they are missing a trick since the evidence proves that they could provide increased accommodation choices for domestic violence victims whilst also saving money.""

The homelessness prevention statistics published today also show that over the past year councils have successfully stopped over 140,000 households and individuals from becoming homeless. Many of these have been helped to find alternative accommodation, often a privately rented home. In other cases, families were able to stay in their current home thanks to help from their council with rent or mortgage arrears or family mediators.

Homelessness is a key priority for the Coalition Government and the Prime Minister has asked Grant Shapps to bring together Ministers from 8 Government departments to work closely together to look at ways their respective policies and frontline services can tackle the multi-faceted issues that contribute to homelessness.

Eric Pickles has put plans in motion to move swiftly to dismantle the funding and powers of regional local authority leaders' boards, which took over most of the functions and staff of the old regional assemblies and are part of the bureaucratic regional structures the Coalition Government is committed to scrapping.

The boards are set to become redundant as the complex regime of regional spatial strategies, which wrested powers on transport, housing and planning powers away from local councils, are abolished.

The dismantling of these boards will see local authorities put firmly back in control of delivering the services and provision for their area and will ensure local people can hold their leaders to account.

Regional leaders boards had an overall budget of £16m per annum - by closing them down, at least £6m will be saved this year from their running costs. The decision will also save local taxpayers money as boards also received funding from local councils of more than £10 million last year.

Two other projects are also being suspended.

  * The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and Yorkshire Forward have paused any further investment in the Sevenstone Sheffield retail quarter regeneration project pending a review of whether the project could deliver better value for money and a clearer assessment of risks.
  * Further HCA funding of up to £10m towards the Kent Thameside Strategic Transport Programme has been suspended and will be considered as part of the forthcoming Spending Review.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2085783,Seaside town rejuvenation: £24 million fund opened,"A new fund to help support much loved seaside towns create new jobs and prosperity was launched today by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Chief Secretary Danny Alexander.

The £23.7million Coastal Communities Fund has been created to provide struggling coastal communities all across the country with money to support new opportunities that can make their town prosper.

Today a variety of organisations are being invited to apply for the funding, first announced by the Chief Secretary, to diversify and transform seaside economies by allowing them to rejuvenate traditional assets or exploit new emerging industries.

Seaside groups could use the money to start programmes that can deliver skills training, offer apprenticeships to school leavers, create new workspaces or support small-scale transport improvements.

Successful applicants can expect to get a grant of between £50,000 and £2million. Mr Pickles said he would especially like to see quality bids come in from social enterprises, charities, local businesses or local enterprise partnerships.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Seaside towns and coastal communities have huge potential for economic growth that we simply can't afford to waste - this fund can make all the difference to these places we all know and love.
> 
> ""This is a great opportunity for long overlooked seaside towns, large and small, to grab a chance to grow through imaginative and innovative projects that create, skilled workers, and provide year round jobs that build stronger local economies.""

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said:

> ""Having grown up in a coastal community in Scotland, I am only too aware of the vital role these communities play in the UK. It is fair that we share the Crown Estate's marine revenues equally and I am delighted to launch the Coastal Communities fund prospectus today.
> 
> ""We look forward to receiving innovative bids from charities, businesses, social enterprises and local organisations, which support the economic development of the community.""

The Fund will be financed by the Government from revenues from the Crown Estate's marine assets. The Fund will be UK wide, with funding allocated to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on the basis of revenue generated by these marine assets. The Fund will be delivered by the Big Lottery Fund's 'BIG Fund'.

Minister of the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, Sammy Wilson, said:

> ""The Northern Ireland Executive is committed to rebuilding and rebalancing the local economy and economic, social and physical renewal is an important part of that. Northern Ireland is renowned for its natural beauty along our coastal routes and this new initiative will provide some welcome funding for a number of local development projects in coastal communities which have much to offer in terms of natural and sustainable tourism.""

### Notes to editors

1. A prospectus setting out eligibility, suggestions of how to use funds and details of how to bid was published today: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/coastalfundprospectus](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/coastalfundprospectus). Applications will be accepted in April.

2. Each country will have a country specific board who will work with Big Fund, the non-Lottery funding operation of the Big Lottery Fund, to deliver the money. The Big Lottery Fund has powers to deliver funding from non-lottery sources for charitable purposes or purposes connected with health, education or the environment.

3. The Fund will be equal to 50 per cent of the revenues generated by the Crown Estate's marine assets. Based on the Crown Estate's Marine revenues in 2010/11 (£47.4million) the overall fund will be worth £23.7million beginning in 2012. Funds can be used to support both capital and revenue projects and communities will be encouraged to match funds with other pots of money.

> ""The riots which took place in our towns and cities in August were shocking acts of criminality which ruined businesses, brought destruction to our streets, and made people feel unsafe in their own homes. But we also saw the law abiding majority reclaiming the streets by protecting friends and neighbours, and helping with the recovery.
> 
> ""As the Prime Minister stated in the aftermath of these disturbances, it is vital that we fully understand and tackle the root causes and do what we can to prevent the scenes from being repeated. The interim report states that ""there was no single cause of the riots and there is no single solution"". Our response to the riots has been and continues to be wide-ranging. We are embarked on a programme of action to tackle entrenched problems like the most troubled families, educational attainment and many other fundamental issues which can give people a stake in society and prevent such disorder from happening again.
> 
> ""The Riots Panel has given a voice to those directly affected. We hope this work will add to the understanding of the causes of the disorder, and we now look forward to the final report.""

### Notes to editors

Government action already taken in response to the riots:

  * In August 2011 the Deputy Prime Minister announced the establishment of an Independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel, led by Darra Singh, to report on wider lessons from the August disorder: [http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/riot-communities-and-victims-panel-announced-0](http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/riot-communities-and-victims-panel-announced-0) (external link).
  * Government's first priority was to provide the police and other agencies with the support and powers they needed to protect individuals, communities and businesses and to get local communities back on their feet.
  * We have already announced we are extending gang injunctions to 14-17 year olds and rolling out by the end of the year.
  * We have launched a consultation on police powers of curfew and the right to remove face coverings.
  * The Home Secretary has asked Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Denis O'Connor, to review the police response and the lessons learned.
  * The Home Secretary, with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has been leading a cross-government programme of action to tackle gangs and serious youth violence, a problem that blights too many of our streets and communities.
  * The Home Secretary has been talking to police forces up and down the country as well as to local agencies, charities, youth organisations and others involved in front-line work to tackle youth violence, as well as hosting an international forum, and will present a report to Parliament shortly.
  * The Government is introducing radical changes to ensure both effective punishment for criminals and introduce reform to break the cycle of offending. We are making our jails places of hard work, getting criminals off drugs and alcohol, toughening community sentences and making offenders pay back to victims and communities for their crimes.
  * The Prime Minister announced on 15 August 2011 that the Government would be reviewing social policy in response to the disturbances.
  * This review of social policies covers a number of Government departments and is looking at a range of issues regarding the 'broken society' -  schools, family policy, parenting, communities, health and safety, cultural, legal, bureaucratic problems, services the Government provides and how they are delivered and the signals that Government sends about the kind of behaviours that are encouraged and rewarded.
  * Central to this work is a commitment to turning around the lives of the 120,000 most troubled families by 2015.
  * Ministers have made it clear that tackling youth unemployment is a priority, with the growth in apprenticeships and work experience opportunities key to giving young people a head start in finding and keeping a job with a future.
  * Private and voluntary sector organisations are investing £581m upfront in the biggest welfare to work programme this country has ever seen to provide tailored support built around the needs of individuals.
  * We are addressing the educational underclass in areas let down for decades - by setting high standards for every child; making no excuses for failure; and fostering real pride in their schools. We are also driving up participation in education and training, so every young person has the skills to get into further study and employment - and to cut the chances of unemployment, poor health and a drift into crime. And intervening earlier to address poor parenting, support families with multiple problems and give opportunities to young people outside school - to overturn poor aspirations and attainment.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2111760,Securing the future of the Fire Service College,"Fire and Rescue Minister Bob Neill has today announced the next steps in securing the future of the Fire Service College. Following a successful pre-market engagement exercise, the Fire Service College will be sold to a private sector company to continue operating as a training centre.

To ensure best value for money for hard-pressed taxpayers and enable the College to continue in its role a number of conditions will be imposed on the proposed sale.  These include commitments that not only will the College be preserved as a national training college for the Fire and Rescue Service but that it will continue to offer wider national resilience and emergency services training and exercises.

Bob Neill said:

> ""The Fire Service College is an asset of national importance, with a world-class reputation and it is vital that we secure its future.
> 
> ""My decision means that the private sector will be able to bring innovation and investment to the College, benefiting taxpayers, local residents, the Fire and Rescue Service and, ultimately, strengthening national resilience.
> 
> ""I know there is real excitement about this opportunity out there in the market and I look forward to seeing some strong bids when the process opens.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Fire Service College is a trading fund and executive agency of the Department for Communities and Local Government. Since becoming a trading fund in 1992, it has never been able to pay a dividend out of operating profits. This situation cannot persist and the Government's response to Fire Futures on 12 April 2011 concluded that the College could achieve its full potential only if there was greater involvement from other sectors in its ownership, operation and governance.

2. The Future Options project considered four options for the future of the College:

  * The status quo: the College remains as a trading fund of the Department
  * A Government Owned Contractor Operated model: the assets remain under Government ownership but management of the College is taken over by a private sector company under a long term contract, together with the staff
  * Disposal as a going concern: the College is sold to a private sector company who would continue to operate the College as a training centre
  * Closure: the College's activities cease, staff are made redundant and the site is sold for an alternative use.

Analysis of the four options showed disposal as a going concern to be the best option. It is the only option which both fully removes from Government the ongoing financial risks of ownership of the College and preserves a national training college for the Fire and Rescue Service.

3. A pre-market engagement exercise has been conducted to invite the views of external partners and to assess the level of private sector interest in the College. There has been real interest in this solution and we expect the College to go to market in early April 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1927988,Shaking up the 'computer says no' town hall culture,"Local Government Minister Grant Shapps and Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark today called on a new generation of councillors to shake up their town halls in the interests of the people they serve and help banish the 'computer says no' culture that exists in some councils.

Government is slashing red tape and putting councillors and communities in control of their local areas. But the Ministers argued they want to go further and faster which is why they today met a group of current and former young and high flying councillors to hear their new and fresh perspective on their role in local government, and how they have shaken things up in their boroughs and made a difference in their community.

The Ministers argued that for too long, central Government's iron grip on councils and a risk-averse culture among some Town Hall officials has thwarted the ambitions of community champions for far too long and put the brakes on plans that could have made a real difference to people's quality of life.

The group included:

  * Cllr James Cottis (Con, Rochford District Council) - along with two other councillors from neighbouring boroughs, he has set up a task force specifically assigned to support young people wanting to stand for election, and helping them find their feet when they get into office; and
  * Cllr Florence Nosegbe, Cabinet Member for Culture, Sport and 2012 Olympic Games (Labour, Lambeth) - was a leading force behind Lambeth Youth Council, where young people are able to discuss a range of issues including teenage pregnancy, caring for elderly relatives and homelessness. Cllr Nosegbe is now responsible for overseeing Libraries, Parks and Open spaces and Olympics.

They have a proven track record of shaking up their council and getting things done for the people they serve. The Ministers asked them what more Government can do to give them the flexibility they need to get on with the jobs they were elected to do.

Ideas included:

  * removing the barriers to younger people becoming councillors, such as help with childcare, and looking again at the times at which council meetings are held
  * encouraging greater transparency, for example by filming council meetings and making this online
  * sharing data among local organisations including councils, the police and health authorities to improve local services.

Mr Shapps wants to see more talented people join this army of community champions and, along with Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark, pledged to make it easier for this new generation by tearing up even more red tape and giving them more powers that will place them centre stage in their communities with more clout than ever before to get things done on a whole range of issues.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We have a long tradition of community action in this country. But for far too long the iron grip of Government has thwarted the efforts of committed people wanting to make a difference in their local area.
> 
> ""This Government has acted quickly to tear up pointless red tape and put councillors in control in their communities with more clout than ever before to get things done.
> 
> ""But I am determined we go further and faster. That's why I am meeting with local councillors with a proven track record of shaking up the status quo to deliver for their local community. I will be asking them what more needs to be done and what further barriers need busting.
> 
> ""These councillors will have impressive stories about how they beat the odds to get an important project off the ground or overhaul a key local service. I hope they can inspire a new generation of community champions to join their ranks. But I also want it to be easier for them. That's why this Government will not let up in its drive to decentralise power and remove stuffy regulations which often hold back would be community champions.""

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""The best ideas come from local people in their local communities. I am determined that Government rules and regulations are there to help, not hinder, as they turn their plans to improve their neighbourhoods into a reality.
> 
> ""That's why I wanted to hear today how a new generation of councillors are moving away from the old ways of doing things to really change things for the better for their local residents. I look forward to seeing how their influences will shake up their Town Halls further in future.
> 
> ""In particular, I will carefully consider their ideas for how we can break down barriers and make it easier for them to shape the future of their communities. And I would urge any council, community organisation or resident to come forward and submit their ideas through our Barrier Busting website.""

### Notes for editors

1. The Government's Barrier Busting website was launched on 15 December 2010. Details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1799233](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1799233).

2. Government has already:

  * abolished Comprehensive Area Assessments, Local Area Agreements and the National Indicator Set meaning Government has relinquished control over nearly 5,000 targets

  * taken more than £2bn out of the ringfence meaning it is up to councils, in consultation with residents, to decide how to spend the money

  * worked to abolish top down targets for building new homes and through the New Homes Bonus introduced a powerful new incentive to give the green light to development

  * abolished strategic housing inspections saving £1.5m of public money.

3. The Localism Bill, currently before Parliament, will devolve unprecedented power from Whitehall to councils and local communities.

Measures include:

  * Introducing a new 'General Power of Competence' which means as long as it is legal councils will be free to act rather than checking with Whitehall first.
  * Scrapping the flawed predetermination rules which have prevented councillors from campaigning on local issues and then voting on the matter. By tearing up these outdated rules that have restricted councillors from championing local issues Government is freeing councillors to get on with the job of representing their communities.
  * Abolishing the discredited Standards Board regime which has fuelled petty and malicious complaints against councillors, while putting in a simple but transparent regime on declaring financial interests.
  * Government is giving councillors more control over how people's cash is spent - local people will decide how to spend money through Community Budgets.
  * Allowing councils, should they wish, to return to the Committee system of local government, which means all councillors have direct involvement in decision-making, rather than it being restricted to a small 'Cabinet'.

4. Attendees at the roundtable were:

  * Cllr Jonathan Ash-Edwards (Con), Mid-Sussex District Council
  * Cllr James Bird (Con), Birmingham City Council
  * Cllr James Cottis (Con), Rochford District Council
  * Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen (Con), London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea
  * Cllr Mike Bell (Lib Dem), North Somerset District Council
  * Cllr Joe Harris (Lib Dem), Cotswold District Council
  * Cllr Florence Nosegbe (Lab), London Borough of Lambeth
  * Cllr Ed Turner (Lab), Oxford City Council
  * Cllr Jason Kitcat (Green), Brighton and Hove Council
  * Cllr Nick Clarke (Con), Cambridgeshire County Council
  * Cllr James Jamieson (Con), Central Bedfordshire Council
  * Jessica Crowe, Centre for Public Scrutiny
  * Cllr Jim McMahon (Lab) Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council
  * Cllr Daisy Benson (Lib Dem), Reading Borough Council
  * Councilman Edward Lord (Lib Dem), Corporation of London
  * Cllr Sarah Richardson (Con), London Borough of Westminster

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1728194,New review shows coalfields communities need local approach,"Local Councils should have a central role to play in the next phase of coalfields regeneration according to a new report welcomed by Housing and Local Government Minister Grant Shapps today.

Mr Shapps said the review by Michael Clapham showed that while much had been achieved regenerating former coalfield areas there is still work to do. Improvement and economic recovery was still fragile and deeply embedded worklessness remained in some former mining areas.

The Report argues local authorities are best placed to understand their own areas and therefore have a central role to play with an increased emphasis on partnership working and flexibility at local level. But traditionally too much funding from central government had restrictive conditions and there was no flexibility to meet local specific needs. In the future, local and national partners need to come together to develop an integrated local programme approach.

Mr Shapps thanked Mr Clapham and said the Government would consider the recommendations carefully.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""It's crucial that former mining areas continue to get the support they need to move on from the devastation caused by the collapse of the coal industry. I've supported vital coalfields regeneration projects for many years and seen first-hand what they have achieved and their importance to these communities.
> 
> ""I am extremely grateful to Michael Clapham and his Board for offering their time and expertise to undertake this important Review. As they have highlighted, there is more to be done to help former mining communities where there are still ingrained social and economic problems.
> 
> ""We agree that it is often local authorities, working with local people, who know best what their particular needs are in each area and should have a central role to play in the next phase of coalfields regeneration. The Government will respond in detail to the recommendations in due course.""

The coalfields programmes have been working for 13 years to regenerate former mining areas and have helped to create jobs and bring derelict land back into use. However, the recent PAC and NAO reports highlight the inefficiencies in the programme - including criticising the lack of clear goals and measures of success.

The Review of Coalfields Regeneration found the state of the coalfields today is a marked improvement on what they were a decade ago but there is still a long way to go. Pressing social challenges that still remain include:

  * Coalfield areas tend to be more isolated than non coalfield areas.
  * Coalfield areas have a higher mortality rate than the average for all districts of England.
  * Coalfield areas suffer a double jeopardy whereby the health of older generations is affected by their former work and that of younger people is equally as affected by poor employment opportunities and low expectations.
  * Coalfield areas have greater overall deprivation and employment deprivation than the average for all districts of England.
  * Coalfield areas have fewer businesses per head of population than the national average for England.
  * Coalfield areas have 25 per cent fewer jobs per resident than non coalfield areas.
  * Coalfield areas have more young people not in education, training or employment than the national average for England.

### Notes to editors

1. Last year, the National Audit Office published a report _Regenerating the English Coalfields_, focusing on CLG's three coalfields regeneration initiatives - the National Coalfields Programme, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust and the Coalfields Enterprise Funds. In response to that report, and in the wake of a Public Accounts Committee hearing in January 2010, Ministers decided that it was timely to re-evaluate what has been done in the coalfields to date, to see where further improvements need to be made and to look where intervention is still needed. A Coalfields Regeneration Review was announced by the previous Government in March this year.

2.The Review was undertaken by a Board, chaired by Michael Clapham (former MP for Barnsley and former Chair of the All-Party Backbench Group of Coalfield MPs), comprising senior representatives from: the Industrial Communities Alliance (the all-party association of local authorities in traditional industrial areas), the HCA, Enterprise Ventures Ltd, and the Coalfields Regeneration Trust, as well as officials from CLG. The Review's purpose was to help inform the direction of future government intervention in former mining communities, both for the remainder of the current Comprehensive Spending Review Period, and also into the next Spending Review period.

3.The Review looked at lessons learnt from the programme's achievements so far. The Review aimed to ensure that the impact of all regeneration expenditure in the coalfields is maximised so that ongoing problems, such as worklessness and health inequalities, are tackled effectively, and that the optimum value for money is achieved for the investments made.

4. Michael Clapham submitted a report to Ministers on 17 September 2010, which is available on the Departmental website ([www.communities.gov.uk](http://www.communities.gov.uk)).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1926274,Shapps asks lenders to back Britain's self-builders,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps will today call on the country's biggest mortgage lenders to back a 'self build revolution' by lending more to those aspiring to build their own home.

In the letter, prepared following discussion with industry and the Building Societies Association and to be sent to key players in the mortgage market, he says that he wants to see building your own house become much more common, to generate much needed supply of affordable and sustainable homes, and calls on them to make more specialist finance products available for self builders.

He says that few people realise that the self-build movement provides more homes than any individual housebuilder, but is still far smaller than in many other countries, and that he believes it could double in size over the next decade.

Lenders often shy away from the self build lending market due to the higher perceived exposure to risk, but with typical interest rates on self build products at around six per cent, Mr.Shapps says that the self builder is an attractive prospective customer and with the self build market relatively undeveloped provided an opportunity for lenders to tap into a new market.

And he says that lenders should not be put off by self build development as that in reality the majority of self build projects are not ""DIY builds"" but involve professional builders, architects and project managers.

He encourages lenders to make more widespread use of indemnity insurance and 'build out' cover to mitigate the risks of self build projects not being finished. He also cited experience from one specialist self build intermediary which indicates that of the 15,000 funded self-build projects started over the past decade, less than 50 have been repossessed.

The UK has one of the smallest proportions of self builders in Europe - today's letter comes as part of the Government's ambitious work programme to encourage growth in the self build sector. He said that whilst Government would play its part, the future growth of the sector depends on lenders themselves backing the country's aspiring builders.

Earlier this year, Mr.Shapps launched a new Industry-Government working group - led by the National Self-Build Association - to generate ideas on how to reduce the barriers faced by prospective builders, including the burden of regulation and the lack of access to land and development finance, which for too long, Mr.Shapps argues, have thwarted the aspirations of people who want to build their own home.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps will say:

> ""Self builders deliver affordable, greener and more innovatively-designed homes; and make a big contribution to the number of new homes built in this country, yet there is scope to significantly increase the number of self built homes in the UK - both for individual households and for community-driven projects.
> 
> ""I want to create a self build revolution where building your own home is not just the preserve of the privileged few and as the mortgage market continues its recovery, lenders have ideal opportunity to diversity lending into areas such as this. With expert knowledge from established intermediaries lenders can make a profit at low risk.
> 
> ""I think there are real business opportunities for lenders here - as the market grows - and I call on them to help make this important housing sector more mainstream.""

As well as proving much needed new housing, there are significant associated benefits to the economy with a stronger self build sector, such as creating local employment opportunities for building professionals, contractors and other property professionals, and helping individuals acquire new skills.

The Government is leading the way by reducing the burden of regulation on the house building industry and putting power in the hands of communities up and down the country, enabling them to give the green light to new developments through the Community Right to Build, and by identifying appropriate opportunities for self-builders when public sector sites are marketed.

### Supportive quotes

Raymond Connor, Chief Executive of BuildStore Financial Services, said:

> ""Compared to the wider housing market, demand for self build finance is continuing to grow, so we would like to see more lenders respond to the self build market, and offer more practical products in order to serve the sector appropriately. The self build market offers high quality lending, and with our development of systems and products which reduce lender's exposure to risk, this presents a great opportunity to provide funding in a growing market, currently worth £2bn annually. As well as enabling more people to build the homes they want and need, funding the self build sector also helps to boost local economies and supports the construction supply chain.""

Martin Bell, Head of customer lending at Norwich and Peterborough Building Society, said:

> ""N&P (Norwich and Peterborough Building Society) is proud to offer self build mortgages and support those who choose to go down the self build route. Building your own home could make perfect financial sense for very many people, and we welcome Grants Shapps' promotion of the self build sector, highlighting the possibilities that are out there. While many may think a self build project is beyond them, it is likely to be much cheaper than buying an existing property and the satisfaction of living in a home that you have seen built from scratch is difficult to match. We are more than happy to talk people through the options available.""

David Lownds, Head of Marketing at the Hanley Economic Building Society, said:

> ""Hanley Economic Building Society has proudly supported Self Build initiatives for the last 3 years. We recognise that there is a need for growth in the self build sector and have demonstrated our commitment to the Self Build proposition through our range of innovative products.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1969848,Shapps calls on Liverpool Football Club not to score an own goal on redevelopment,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today written to Liverpool Football Club, calling on them not to score an own goal by delaying a decision on their future home.

In a letter to Ian Ayre, Managing Director of the club, Mr Shapps said that the future regeneration of Anfield, one of Liverpool's most deprived communities, rests on the critical decision which is still to be made by the club: whether to begin work on expanding and redeveloping the existing stadium on Anfield Road or build a brand new one in nearby Stanley Park.

Mr Shapps pointed to his recent visit to the city, where he saw first hand the need for regeneration and investment, and how residents of the area feel stranded after waiting for years to see work begin.

The Minister said that a new or redeveloped stadium would not only allow the club to increase their capacity and improve facilities for players and fans, but would lead to significant regeneration in an area of high deprivation. He said it would lead to new homes, schools and a health centre in an area of the country that badly needs these amenities.

And he said that as well as driving economic growth and contributing to the local economy, a clear decision by the Club could contribute to a resurgence in private sector enterprise and help support more people back into work.

Mr Shapps said that as a significant presence in the community and a prominent local business, Liverpool Football Club had a responsibility to its local community and an important role to play in driving growth and improving the social and physical quality of the area.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""On my visit last month I saw for myself the impact that the decision yet to be taken by Liverpool Football Club will have on the area, and how much the local people in Anfield need certainty and a definite decision on the future of their neighbourhood.
>

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1617245,Shapps gives more power to councils to solve local problems with shared homes,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps is handing over more power to councils so they can manage high concentrations of shared housing in their area, without putting off landlords from renting the homes people need. 

### Power to tackle problem areas

![View of houses](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1617201.jpg)

Areas with lots of shared homes, known as Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), have often created problems for local communities. Neighbourhoods with too many properties let to short term tenants often attract crime and have problems with litter and anti social behaviour.

Mr Shapps is giving councils more flexibility so they can focus on controlling the unplanned spread of shared homes in problem areas, but avoid tying landlords in unnecessary red tape.

> ""Local people know the local problems they face - they don't need top-down diktats from Whitehall telling them how to solve them""

Changes to legislation will give councils the freedom to choose areas where landlords must submit a planning application to rent their properties to unrelated tenants - known as Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs).

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Local people know the local problems they face - they don't need top-down diktats from Whitehall telling them how to solve them, or indeed telling them to solve problems that don't exist in their area in the first place.
> 
> ""I'm not going to create unnecessary costs for landlords that could damage the rental sector and limit the number of properties available for rent, particularly when so many young people working in our towns and cities rely on sharing with friends for an affordable home. 
> 
> ""That's why I want to give councils the flexibility they need so they can use planning rules to control the spread of shared housing in neighbourhoods where they cause problems, without tying local landlords in red tape where shared housing causes few, if any, problems at all."" 

### Landlord fears

The problems that arise from concentrations of HMOs are not widespread and current rules impose an unnecessary burden on landlords and councils in those areas where HMOs are not a problem. 

It also runs the risk of reducing supply if landlords choose to move out of the sector rather than face the costs and delays of applying for planning permission.

It is estimated that as many as 8,500 planning applications could be submitted each year if every landlord looking to turn their property into a HMO is first required to seek permission - instead, councils will be able to focus their efforts in particular neighbourhoods where HMOs present a problem, while landlords of HMOs in other areas will not be tied up in red tape.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1809223,Shapps moves to stop bulldozers demolishing Ringo Starr's birthplace,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called for a temporary reprieve to the demolition of Ringo Starr's birthplace to ensure the people of Liverpool have a chance to have their say in what happens to what many consider to be a culturally important building.

Mr Shapps has written to Liverpool City Council asking them to halt the planned demolition to give the local community and other interested organisations an opportunity to put forward alternative viable preservation options.

Ringo Starr's former home is one of a number of properties due to be demolished in the Welsh Streets neighbourhood of Liverpool as part of a wider regeneration programme by the Council.

A special meeting of Liverpool City Council's Planning Committee is expected to take place in January where the demolition of Ringo Starr's former home and other houses will be considered. If approved the council would give two weeks notice of demolition.

The Government has received a request from SAVE Britain's Heritage to direct Liverpool City Council to dispose of an area. The Public Request to Order Disposal (PROD) process allows citizens to write to the Secretary of State, Communities and Local Government, requesting action be taken regarding under/ unused land (including buildings) and he may direct that the land be disposed of. SAVE hope that this will help save these houses from demolition. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is considering this request in the normal way.

But this request clearly demonstrates the strength of feeling locally and prompted Mr Shapps to call for a delay to demolition to see if an alternative community-led solution is possible and to ensure that there is sufficient time for a full and proper consideration of SAVE Britain's Heritage request.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Any regeneration project will generate strong feelings. But when what many people consider to be a culturally important building - such as the birthplace of the drummer of the world's most famous band - is at risk then feelings are going to be even stronger.
> 
> ""That's why before a single bulldozer rumbles along Madryn Street I want to ensure that every option has been considered. In particular I want local community groups to have the opportunity to put forward viable proposals to preserve this historic house. This gives an opportunity to look at imaginative reuse of terraced housing - which has proved popular and successful elsewhere. It's right that the people of Liverpool themselves decide whether they want Ringo Starr's house to be demolished or to Let It Be.""

### Notes to editors

  1. The inner core of Liverpool includes the Welsh streets neighbourhood which is made up of a high proportion of terraced properties built before 1919. The New Heartlands Housing Market Renewal (HMR) Pathfinder and Liverpool City Council have put forward proposals to demolish more than 300 houses in the Welsh Streets neighbourhood and to replace these with new housing.
  2. The proposed demolition of Welsh streets is still subject to the planning process and application to demolish has been made for prior approval of details under the Town and Country Planning Act (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. This will be considered in terms of the proposed method of demolition and details of the proposed restoration of the site. City Council Planning Officers will be submitting a report to a special meeting of the Planning Committee held in public early in the new year.
  3. The Public Request to Order Disposal (PROD) process originates from S98(1) of the Local government, Planning and Land Act 1980. It allows citizens to write to the Secretary of State, Communities and Local Government, requesting action be taken regarding under/ unused land (including property thereon) owned by certain public bodies (listed in Schedule 16 of the Act, for example local authorities). Where the Secretary of State agrees that the land is under/ unused, and the owner has been unable to put forward a convincing case to justify any other course of action, he may direct that the land be disposed of. The Secretary of State may add certain conditions regarding the timing/ form of disposal, but is not able to direct to whom the land is sold.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1612019,Shapps promise to landlords: no more red tape,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today announced that he will be scrapping plans to introduce new regulations on private landlords.

There are one million landlords in England - nearly three quarters of which are individuals who may be renting a single room out.

Of the three million private tenants in this country, the vast majority report they are satisfied with the service they receive from their landlords.

Speaking in Parliament, Mr Shapps confirmed that with the private rented sector already governed by a well established legal framework, the Government has no plans to introduce any further regulations.

Instead, he urged councils to use the wide range of powers they already have at their disposal to tackle the minority of rogue landlords that blight some communities, provide a poor service to tenants and damage the reputation of the private rented sector.

Council powers include:

  * Powers to require landlords to take action to rectify hazards in their property;
  * Where landlords resist, the ability to make and charge for improvements and to prohibit use of the affected parts of the property; and
  * Discretionary licensing powers to tackle areas blighted by poorly managed privately rented stock.

New regulations were proposed by the previous administration in response to the Rugg Review of the Private Rented Sector, but have been judged by the new coalition to introduce too much additional red tape. These included a National Register of Landlords, regulation of letting and managing agents, and compulsory written tenancy agreements.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""With the vast majority of England's three million private tenants happy with the service they receive, I am satisfied that the current system strikes the right balance between the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.
> 
> ""So today I make a promise to good landlords across the country: the Government has no plans to create any burdensome red tape and bureaucracy, so you are able to continue providing a service to your tenants.
> 
> ""But for the bad landlords, I am putting councils on alert to use the range of powers already at their disposal to make sure tenants are properly protected.""

### Notes to Editors

1. Plans to increase the annual rental threshold for assured and assured shorthold tenancies from the current level of £25,000 to £100,000 will go ahead. The Statutory Instrument raising the threshold, ""The Assured Tenancies (Amendment) (England) Order 2010 - SI 2010 No. 908"" was laid on 25 March and the change will come into effect on 1 October 2010.  This will apply to all existing and new tenancies and will restore the position intended in the original legislation.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1781935,Shapps welcomes publication of Kickstart assessments,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today welcomed publication of key design assessments of the Kickstart housebuilding programme, describing their release as a necessary step in opening up Government records to the public.

Following a request from the Information Commissioner, the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) is publishing Building for Life Assessments for Round 1 and Round 2 Kickstart projects - given the green light between September 2009 and July 2010. The assessments were carried out by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) on behalf of the HCA. Earlier this year there was controversy over the decision not to make these scores public.

The Kickstart programme was designed to help get stalled developments back on track during the recession.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""We are transforming Government at all levels by opening up our records to the public. Openness may be uncomfortable for some but we know that proper public scrutiny will lead to far better decisions - and save money as well.
> 
> ""So I welcome that this important element of assessment of Kickstart housing projects is now finally publicly available. This is the right thing to do and something I strongly agree with. Government needs to lead by example so this is a necessary step in opening up all public records.""

### Notes to editors

1. The Kickstart Programme was run by the Homes and Communities Agency, and offered Government funding to get work restarted on housing developments stalled by the economic downturn. As part of this, CABE were commissioned to assess the design of projects awarded Kickstart funding against their Building for Life standard. Details of the Building for Life standard can be found at: [http://www.buildingforlife.org/about](http://www.buildingforlife.org/about) (external link).

2. The Building for Life scores are part of a wider report published today by the Homes and Communities Agency on the lessons learnt from the Kickstart housing delivery programme. A copy of the Kickstart review of Round 2 and a full list of the Building for Life Assessments is available at: [http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1847414,"150,000 council homes to be brought up to standard","Housing Minister Grant Shapps today confirmed the allocation of nearly £1.6bn in funding to bring 150,000 council homes to a decent standard and improve the lives of the thousands of residents that live in them.

Despite a tough Spending Review, the Government announced the capital investment to help towards completing the Decent Homes programme in the council housing sector.

Announcing the outcome of the bidding process, Mr Shapps said that 50 local authorities will benefit from funding, protecting some of the most vulnerable people in our society.

The bids submitted by local authorities had to go through a rigorous assessment process undertaken by the Homes and Communities Agency to ensure that maximum value for money for the taxpayer and maximum benefit for the country's council housing tenants.

Successful bids were those where the authority made a strong case for investment need and had already demonstrated significant cost reductions - where this is the case the authority has been awarded levels of funding close to their bid.

The funding will help tackle the backlog of non-Decent homes in preparation for the introduction of a new fairer system of council house financing.

The self-financing proposal, which is a key measure of the Localism Bill currently before Parliament, will put councils firmly in control of managing their housing stock and bring an end to the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system. This offers the best way of maintaining the country's social housing stock as councils will be able to manage their finances over the long term rather than on a year by year basis.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""To reflect our commitment to fairness and protecting the most vulnerable people in our society, we set aside over £2bn at the Spending Review to bring as many social homes as we can up to scratch - this was despite the tough decisions we took to tackle the record deficit.
> 
> ""£1.6bn of the funding is for council homes, and some 50 local authorities will benefit from this funding - allowing them to improve around 150,000 houses. Too many families live in non-decent accommodation, so I am pleased that so many of them will see a difference to due this funding.
> 
> ""I have already announced my intention to give councils and communities the power to manage their own stock through a system of self-financing - bringing new freedoms and flexibilities and greater efficiency savings. This funding will help ready those councils facing the most difficulties in tackling the non-decent homes on their books.""

Pat Ritchie, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) said:

> ""These allocations will make a significant impact in local communities and is good news for the tenants who will benefit from improvements to their homes. At the HCA our involvement does not end with this investment, and we will now work with councils and other landlords to maximise the impact of funding through our enabling role.""

### Notes to editors

  1. Funding commitments will be made for the four years of the Spending Review period, with 2013-14 and 2014-15 allocations being indicative and subject to future confirmation (as part of the implementation of Self Financing).
  2. Following the Spending Review Grant Shapps jointly with the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) launched a consultation on proposals for allocating funding to councils and social landlords in order to tackle the Decent Homes backlog. The HCA launched a bidding round in December with a closing date of 13 January. They received 70 bids totalling £2.7bn and in consultation with the Mayor for London, have allocated funding in line with the guidelines set out in the Invitation to Bid.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1974166,More powers for communities to choose boats on water alongside bricks and mortar,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today urged local authorities not to become landlocked intheir quest to meet local housing needs - but to consider how new powers restoring local control over housing provision and planning can enable people to choose boats on water alongside bricks and mortar.

Mr Shapps said that more people than ever are choosing to make a boat their home and that boats with residential moorings could be an example of how unconventional housing can allow people to live in areas of the country where perhaps they couldn't afford to do so otherwise.

And as new moorings could be eligible for the New Homes Bonus, the Minister said that there was a strong incentive for councils and communities to grant planning permission for more residential moorings. The money that they receive could be invested in new marina facilities or waterside recreational activities that everyone could benefit from, as well as being used to attract further private investment and drive the regeneration of the often-Brownfield land around parts of the country's waterways.

Half the population live within five miles one of Britain's waterways and so not just those living on the water could benefit from the fresh injection of funding; water based recreation and tourism is thought to generate over £1 billion for local economies, and supports 24,000 jobs.

Mr Shapps said that the Government's commitment to Localism could be an opportunity for living on boats to be given a new lease of life, and allow people to secure a residential mooring that would allow them to live closer to their jobs, family, or children's school.

Citing the inexorable shift in power down to councils and communities, he said that where boaters, councils, navigation authorities and local communities work together, they could create more residential moorings as part of the contribution to increase the housing supply in their area and house more families:

  * new powers in the Localism Bill restoring local control over housing, and untying the hands of communities that will allow them to find innovative ways to meet local housing need and regenerate their area
  * handing over control of British Waterways in England and Wales - the country's biggest navigation authority - to the voluntary sector from April 2012, giving local communities a stronger role in determining the future of their waterways
  * the Government's commitment to a new, simpler planning system better tailored to the needs of communities
  * greater transparency from councils and other public bodies on their public property ownership - including on the waterside - allowing them to identify new development opportunities.

And emphasising the need to find a mooring with residential consent before choosing to live afloat, Mr Shapps said that creating more residential long-term moorings could also help reduce the numbers resorting to unlawful overstaying on the towpath.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Whilst they will never overtake bricks and mortar in putting a roof over the heads of families, innovative new ways of housing families - such as residential moorings - play an important role in allowing people to live near to their place of work, children's school, or family, and where perhaps they would not be able to afford to otherwise.
> 
> ""Around 15,000 people live on our waterways and many more would like to do so. The Government's commitment to Localism could be an opportunity for living on boats to be given a new lease of life. Where houseboats pay council tax, communities will be eligible for the New Homes Bonus, so the potential economic benefits are huge.
> 
> ""Landlords, councils and communities all have a clear incentive to get more mooring sites in their areas and not become landlocked in their quest to meet local housing needs.""

Sally Ash, Head of Boating at British Waterways said:

> ""The number of people visiting and enjoying our canals and rivers has grown in recent years and this waterways renaissance has triggered strong demand from people wanting to live afloat.  We welcome the Minister's encouragement to local authorities to support the creation of purpose built residential mooring sites which we hope will help to alleviate localised congestion along the towpaths. We are also pleased to note the reassurance from Mr Shapps' department that people can qualify for housing benefit for help with mooring fees.""

Alan Wildman, Chairman of the Residential Boat Owners' Association (RBOA) said:

> ""Living afloat is arguably the most sustainable, lowest impact way to live, whilst still being able to enjoy 100 per cent of the modern amenities that are available to those who live in conventional housing.""

### Notes to editors

1. According to the Residential Boat Owners Association around 15,000 people live on boats on Britain's rivers, canals, and tidal waters.

2. British Waterways, the country's largest navigation authority responsible for 3,000 kms of navigable canals and rivers, estimates that it is host to around 7,000 residential boaters, but that the majority of these do not currently benefit from having a home mooring suitable for long term residential use.

3. British Waterways has recently published guidance for development of new residential moorings sites as an aid to local authorities and private investors, which is available at [www.britishwaterways.co.uk/resimoorguidance](http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/media/documents/British_Waterways_guidelines_for_residential_mooring_sites_May_2011.pdf) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2006372,New funding boost for homeless hostels,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced a major cash boost to improve homeless hostels across the country.

Today, £37.5m funding for the Homelessness Change Programme has been allocated to help 37 projects improve facilities for rough sleepers and provide almost 1,200 extra bed spaces, including over 320 extra beds in the London area, as well as helping people find employment.

But speaking at the No Second Night Out Conference, Mr Shapps said that in view of the high demand for the funding, a further £5million will be allocated to the Homelessness Change Programme, with further allocations to be announced very shortly.

He added that this funding will be for councils, charities and housing associations to help transform the lives of people sleeping rough, helping them break the cycle of homelessness and get their lives back on track.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""It is shocking that there are rough sleepers on the streets of 21st century Britain who continue to fall through the net of assistance that's on offer.
> 
> ""I want all communities to make it their priority to protect the most vulnerable in society. That's why this Government is offering more help to the councils, charities and housing associations who do a fantastic job at helping those living on the streets.
> 
> ""The £37.5million I'm allocating today will enable these organisations to reach out to even more vulnerable people, and help break the vicious cycle of rough sleeping that traps them in despair. And because of the high demand for the funding, and because tackling homelessness is my top priority, I'm putting another £5million towards the programme which we will allocate to projects very shortly.""

A variety of projects and providers will benefit from the new investment, including:

  * **St Mungo's, City of London** - the hostel will provide extra accommodation for long term rough sleepers currently in the City of London

  * **YMCA, Cheltenham** - a scheme to help young homeless people with a new 73 bed facility spread across a number of sites

  * **Framework, North Lincolnshire** - will develop a 20 bed facility with onsite training in an area where the needs of rough sleepers are not currently met.

The extra funding follows the national roll out of 'No Second Night Out' earlier in the summer -  a scheme that identifies new rough sleepers and helps them off the streets immediately so that they do not fall into a dangerous rough sleeping lifestyle. A new £20 million Homelessness Transition Fund for the voluntary sector will help them deliver the pledge.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1617158,Power for councils to manage shared homes in their area,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced that councils will have greater flexibility to manage concentrations of shared housing in their area, without tying landlords in red tape.

A high concentration of shared homes can sometimes cause problems, especially if too many properties in one area are let to short term tenants with little stake in the local community.

So changes to legislation will give councils the freedom to choose areas where landlords must submit a planning application to rent their properties to unrelated tenants - known as Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs).

This will enable high concentrations of HMOs to be controlled where local authorities decide there is a problem, but will prevent landlords across the country being driven from the rental market by high costs and red tape.

It is estimated that as many as 8,500 planning applications could be submitted each year if every landlord looking to turn their property into a HMO is first required to seek permission - instead, councils will be able to focus their efforts in particular neighbourhoods where HMOs present a problem, while landlords of HMOs in other areas will not be tied up in red tape.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Councils know about local issues with shared homes, and don't need top-down rules from Whitehall to deal with problems that don't exist. Where too many shared homes are causing problems for other residents or changing the character of a neighbourhood, councils should be able to control their spread. But I'm not going to create unnecessary costs for landlords, which puts the supply of rented homes at risk.
> 
> ""That's why I'm giving councils the power to decide whether to use the planning system to control the spread of shared housing where it is a problem. This will give them the flexibility to make decisions that are right for their communities, rather than stifling the rental market with unnecessary costs and red tape.
> 
> ""Shared homes ensure people who want to live and work in towns and cities can do so, and are vital to the economy. These changes will safeguard the supply of shared housing where it is needed without burdening landlords with cumbersome red tape - but will also hand councils the flexibility they need to tackle problems where they occur.""

Liz Peace, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said:

> ""Grant Shapps has taken quick and decisive action after this law was rushed through in April without sufficient clarification. At a time when council resource is scarce and housing is needed it makes no sense to be forcing thousands of local landlords and planning officers to be engaged in unnecessary bureaucracy. The Minister said last week that deregulation would characterise his approach to the private rented sector and as with other moves to cut red tape, these are further welcome steps.""

Removing this one blanket requirement follows the Government's commitment to scrap one size fits-all solutions in the planning system that create unnecessary bureaucracy and costs for councils and businesses.

### Notes to editors

1. Councils are to be given more flexibility to manage HMOs in their area. The problems that arise from concentrations of HMOs are not widespread and the current requirement imposes an unnecessary burden on landlords and local planning authorities in those areas where HMOs are not a problem.  It also runs the risk of reducing supply if landlords choose to move out of the sector rather than face the costs and delays of applying for planning permission.

2. The definition of a small HMO (the C4 use class) will remain and permitted development rights will be extended to allow all changes between the C4 and C3 classes without the need for planning applications.  In areas where there is a need to control HMO development, local authorities will be able to use an Article 4 direction to remove these permitted development rights and require planning applications for such changes of use.

3. These proposals will mean that any change of use between dwelling houses and small HMOs will be able to happen without planning permission unless the local council believes there is problem with such development in a particular area. In these areas they will be able to use article 4 powers to require planning permission.

4. Consultation with interested partners on this issue will ensure that the new rules work effectively for local people without placing an unnecessary burden on landlords and local planning authorities.

5. The proposals are part of wider reform to the planning system so that it moves away from the current top-down approach and create a system which encourages local people to take responsibility for shaping their communities, and gives power to councils to make this happen.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1724223,Stop hindering help for the homeless with bureaucracy,"In his first visit to Birmingham as Housing Minister, Grant Shapps heard from people on the frontline in the fight against homelessness how the most vulnerable in society can be best protected while the Government works to tackle the deficit.

### Expert advice

Mr Shapps met workers and residents at St Basil's foyer to see for himself how Government funding could be spent more wisely.

After listening to views at the homeless centre, the Minister said it was clear the current system of endless inspections and form filling is not the best way to help young people at risk of homelessness.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""When the people who run one of the top agencies in the country for preventing youth homelessness say the current system to manage them is a burden, it's time to listen.
> 
> ""Let's make no mistake - it's vital that these centres are well run. But rather than civil servants in Whitehall inventing new bureaucratic hoops to jump through, why don't we listen to the experts on the ground.
> 
> ""I'm determined to help organisations like St Basil's who do an excellent job at helping young homeless people and turning their lives around. So in future there will be more trust and less bureaucracy, and a much more sensible and systematic way to maintain standards.""

### Centres of excellence

St Basil's is the national Registered Social Landlord Centre of Excellence in the prevention of youth homelessness and one of the largest agencies in the country.

They are one of the leading organisations in the country working on youth homelessness, and have an excellent track record of delivering a wide range of accommodation and support options for young people.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1779907,We're lifting burdens from the backs of builders,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced he is scrapping new proposals that could have cost developers thousands of pounds extra to build new homes, and pledged an overhaul of the complicated building standards that make it hard for developers to complete their projects.

The Government will not introduce a new set of building standards that were proposed for many of the homes built with Government funding or on public sector land, which would have cost developers an extra £8,000 for every home.

Ministers believe that the national building standards are sufficient to deliver high quality homes, and it is an unfair and unnecessary expense for developers to require additional building standards for public build, at a time when the country desperately needs to build more homes.

Mr Shapps also pledged to end the 'alphabet soup' of local building standards and red tape that blight efforts to get developments started, and sweep away the bureaucratic assessment regimes that accompany them. He invited the industry to come forward and help develop a new system for local standards so new development meets the needs of local communities, without placing an unnecessary strain on developers.

Currently housebuilders face a complex mix of building standards and codes that are attached to planning permissions. Ministers believe these extra requirements are often unnecessary 'gold plating', which can be contradictory and place additional costs on developers, making their projects less viable.

In their place, housebuilders and councils will work together to develop a simple and transparent 'menu' of costed standards that will not place unrealistic burdens on developers. Today's move is designed to make it easier for companies to build new developments where they are wanted, and follows the Government's pledge to match the council tax raised from new homes for the first six years through the New Homes Bonus. Councils that go for growth will build up rewards for their local area, and there will be a higher level of funding for building new affordable homes.

Speaking to the National House Building Council, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Today is the first step of many towards reducing the unnecessary cost and hassle that the people who build our homes are forced to endure. Last year, housebuilding slumped to the lowest level in peacetime since 1924. We were in the midst of a recession, but the situation was made much worse by regional targets that forced developers into direct conflict with local communities, and compounded by the alphabet soup of regulations and red tape that housebuilders have to navigate.
> 
> ""We are on the side of families who want more good quality homes available - that's why we're scrapping expensive new standards for homes built with Government cash and on public land. There's no good reason why homes built on public land should be built any differently to those of high quality on private land. So I'm getting rid of this unnecessary requirement, and I'll be working hard to make sure that, in the long run, the standards that apply to private and public housing are exactly the same.
> 
> ""I'm also calling time on the cocktail of local building standards that developers have to meet, some of which are directly contradictory. House builders are the experts at building homes, so I'm inviting them to be in charge of developing a new framework for local building standards - one which enables communities to get the high quality homes they demand, but without causing unnecessary costs and delays for developers.""

House Builders Federation Executive Chairman Stewart Basely said:

> ""Having campaigned for a reduction in the 'regulatory burden on new homes' for many years it's great that the Government has recognised the impact the cost of excessive regulation has on the supply of the homes the country desperately needs. We look forward to working with local and national government to create a simpler, less costly system which will go a long way to helping solve our housing crisis.""

National House Building Council Chief Executive Imtiaz Farookhi said:

> ""I'm delighted that the Minister has chosen to announce details of this critical policy area at our annual lunch later today and welcome the invitation to play a central role in developing the policy process. We look forward to making a positive contribution working with government and others to deliver a successful policy for the industry and new home owners.""

Proposals for new Core Standards for development funded or on land owned by the Homes and Communities Agency, which could on average have cost developers an additional £8,000 per home, will not be implemented. In the meantime, to provide stability and protect delivery, the HCA will continue to use existing standards, but Mr Shapps confirmed in the longer term, the standards that apply to private and public housing should be the same. As a start to this process, all centrally-imposed standards for houses built on surplus central government land will be removed, in a move expected to provide a boost to home builders.

From today, work will begin on a new Local Standards Framework that will be developed and maintained by industry and councils. The Government will help its development, but industry and councils will develop the ideas themselves, to ensure the options proposed meet the needs of local communities, and don't impose unrealistic burdens on developers. The new local framework will be implemented through the National Planning Policy Framework, which will be introduced by April 2012.

Mr Shapps also confirmed that the recent review of Building Regulations will be published shortly, and will keep the regulations as the mechanism to set national minimum standards. Starting today, there will be an opportunity for developers to make suggestions for further deregulation of the industry.

The Government made a commitment in the Spending Review to reduce the overall regulatory burden on the house-building industry by March 2015, and today's announcement is an important step towards this.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1749247,Sheerness port companies bolstered by £9 million tax refund,"Local Government Minister Bob Neill went to Sheerness Port today where he heard how the government's decision to waive £175m of unexpected port taxes across the country was benefiting local port businesses.

Mr Neill told workers that the government would be introducing specific new legislation before the end of the year that would take forward the promise made in June to cancel these crippling backdated business rate bills.

Sheerness alone faced a backdated bill of almost £9 million. Leaders of local port businesses told the minister how the government's decision had saved local jobs and given export companies the confidence to reinvest and grow.   
   
Bob Neill said:

> ""Hearing about Sheerness's journey first hand has confirmed for me that our decision to waive and repay these unexpected  port taxes was a victory for common sense. They can now move forward unburdened by these unexpected debts
> 
> ""It's clear to me that our swift action has saved many port-based businesses and jobs, and ensured that Britain remains a powerful force in European exports. Today I can confirm that we will introduce legislation before the end of the year that will permanently consign these unfair back taxes to the scrapheap.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1925286,Shining a light on council spending could save up to £450 per household,"Councils could save £10 billion every year if they improve the way they buy, source and pay for goods and services new research reveals today.

New, cutting edge analysis of council spending data by procurement experts Opera Solutions has revealed that greater transparency coupled with improved analysis is the key to unlocking massive savings by driving down costs.

The report gives the highest estimate yet of potential savings that could be achieved if councils secure better value for the £50 billion of public money they spend on procurement every year. The £10 billion figure is equal to £452 per household every year and equivalent to the salaries of almost half a million bin men or 650,000 dinner ladies.

Opera looked at spending on energy, mobile phone and legal services across three separate local authorities. The bill for these services totalled £13.6 million pounds. By consolidating that spend in order to boost buying power and get better prices Opera  estimated the three councils could shave a collective £1.44 million off their bills - a 10 per cent reduction.

The report argues that Local Government, by adopting new processes and making better use of spending analysis, could replicate these kind of savings across a wide range of back office functions, with no impact on quality of service and reduce spending by up to £10 billion a year. Even if only half of those savings were achieved local government could still realise significant reductions in spending. The report recommends that councils:

  * **Make better use of data** - greater transparency of council spending data has made it much easier to identify incorrect payments, eliminate duplicate spending and fraud, reduce multiple suppliers and spot where different prices are being paid for similar services. The report argues that the next stage in driving out waste must be making more intelligent use of this information, compare spending within and across different councils to find opportunities to drive down costs.
  * **Bulk buy** - at the moment spending is fragmented both within and across councils. By joining forces with neighbouring authorities councils can drive down overheads and secure significantly better economies of scale.
  * **Shop around** - to secure better prices increase competition between suppliers, negotiate harder on contracts and end over-reliance on a small number of vendors to provide a large numbers of services.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Householders trying to balance their bills are advised to look closely at where all their money is going, change suppliers, shop around and hunt out the bargains. Town halls need to follow exactly the same advice.""
> 
> ""Let there be no doubt whatsoever - today's figures show that there is significant scope for councils to make taxpayers' money work even harder. We've always said that sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the availability of financial data has helped identify numerous ways that councils can reduce expenditure while offering the same or better services to residents. If councils improved their procurement and joint working on waste services, councils could afford to offer more frequent and regular rubbish collections. There's no excuse for cutting the front line when there are so many savings to be found in the way back office services and run and paid for.""

Ray Eitel-Porter, Executive Director - Europe at Opera Solutions added:

> ""As local government are asked to find ways to spend public money as efficiently as possible, we have found that procurement optimisation is one avenue that quickly delivers ongoing savings that can be redirected to critical programs and services.""

This year, as part of urgent plans to drive down the nation's deficit, central government has reduced the spending power of local authorities by £2.6 billion. Today's report, which identifies up to £10 billion of potential savings reinforces the argument for councils being able to reduce expenditure, protect the frontline and avoid a ""slash and burn"" approach if they concentrate on the savings found in back office spending and processes.

The research by Opera Solutions suggests that a lack of procurement expertise amongst council staff, lack of buy-in from senior executives and fears that joining forces with other councils to collectively buy goods and services will result in less control are putting the brakes on simple changes that could drive out waste, drive down cost and save the public purse billions of pounds.

In contrast some councils are showing the way, saving money by revisiting contracts, reducing overheads and increasing efficiency:

  * **Cornwall** council streamlined their waste collection contracts from six to one council wide contract cutting a £25 million cost by £3 million and providing a better service.

  * In the **South East** there is already a 'Best Deals Service', which enables authorities to benefit from deals on a range of products from pens to refuse collection vehicles. The service has already achieved savings for the region in excess of £3 million; and for this financial year in excess of £1 million and now intend to look at a wider range of services including telecommunications, vehicle maintenance, training and utilities.

  * In **Essex** a number of local authorities have joined together to form a shared services hub for procurement,  enabling procurement arrangements arrived at for one authority in the group to be made available to all other members - and to a wider group wherever possible - the hub also provides access to expert procurement advice.

  * **Trafford** is saving £4.3 million on smarter procurement and £2.3 million on management.

The Local Government Group's own [productivity programme](http://local.gov.uk/lgv2/core/page.do?pageId=579930) (external link) is also supporting councils to do things differently starting with quick wins like e-auctions and recovering duplicated payments.

The Opera report confirms what Cllr Paul Bettison,of Bracknell Forest Borough Council, and Andrew Smith, Chief Executive of Hampshire, who are leading the Local Productivity Programme's work on Capital, Assets and Procurement have been saying for some time. They've already published a 'Quick Wins' and, more recently, a 'Big Wins' strategy calling councils to collaborate to unlock 10-20 per cent savings in areas like construction. They advocate the use of collaborative frameworks to help councils join up their spending power. Baroness Hanham has championed the Local Productivity Programme, which aims to help local authorities enhance the productivity of local authority procurement spend and transform services to ensure that every penny of tax payers money goes towards preserving front line services.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1889942,Shropshire flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Shropshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Mr Pickles raised the first flag - for his adopted home county of Essex - in a ceremony also attended in September by celebrity astrologer and long-time English county campaigner Russell Grant.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Union Flag rightly has pride of place outside the Department but I'm delighted it will now be flown alongside our traditional and ceremonial county flags.
> 
> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county - both the traditional 'cricket' counties and in some cases their more modern administrative successors. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together and it's right that the Government department responsible for communities and local government should be actively recognising the important role they play.""

Leader of Shropshire Council, Councillor Keith Barrow said:

> ""We're delighted that the Shropshire flag will be flying in London this week. Shropshire has a long and rich heritage, which people who live here are understandably proud of. As a council we are working hard to support our communities and improve people's lives now and for the future.""

### Notes to editors

The Department is obliged to fly the European Union flag during Europe Week (w/c 9 May) under Article 7(2) of EC Regulation 1828/2006.

The Shropshire flag has been kindly loaned by the Association of British Counties at no charge.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1763213,Shutting the door to squatters,"Making homeowners as aware of their rights as those looking to take over their properties will help shut the door to squatters, said Housing Minister Grant Shapps.

### Stopping squatters guide

Mr Shapps has launched an online guide for homeowners setting out their rights and what to do if their property is invaded, so they can get their homes back as quickly as possible.

There are an estimated 20,000 squatters in the UK. Recent high profile examples of  home owners who have fallen victim to squatters taking over their  homes include Connan Gupta, whose home in Camberwell, South London, was taken over by squatters after he'd moved out while repairs were being made; and 72-year-old George Pope, whose home in Barking was taken over by squatters while he stayed with friends.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Recent high profile cases have served to illustrate the distress and misery that squatters can cause. I want to shut the door to squatters once and for all, and for homeowners to know their rights just as well as those looking to take over their properties.
> 
> ""That's why today I'm publishing advice making clear how the law is on their side, and that there are steps they can take to take back their home quickly and effectively.""

(See link, top right.)

The review is part of the Government's Housing Strategy, and will examine how to boost investment in rental properties - helping support the rapid growth of the private rented sector by increasing the supply of affordable homes.

Launching the call for evidence, Sir Adrian said:

> ""I want to focus on two fundamental questions. Will the changes that the Government has introduced go far enough to generate significant new flows of investment? And, if not, what can be done to accelerate things?""

The review builds on previous work undertaken by the Government including changing the stamp duty on bulk purchases, reforms to residential Real Estate Investment Trusts in the United Kingdom and the Homes and Communities Agency's private rented sector initiative. So the emphasis is very much on new evidence and fresh thinking.

Sir Adrian is supported in the review by an expert reference group consisting of Vidhya Alakeson (Resolution Foundation), Graham Burnett (Universities Superannuation Scheme), Tim Brown (De Montfort University), Ian Fletcher (British Property Federation), Nick Jopling (Grainger plc), Victoria Mitchell (Savills), Martin Moore (Prudential Property Investment), Nick Salisbury (Consultant), and Peter Vernon (Grosvenor Ltd).

Submissions are sought by 31 March and Sir Adrian plans to report his findings and possible recommendations to Ministers in June 2012.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1794678,Six steps to return power to the people,"Six essential actions to create a new decentralised Britain where power once again belongs to the people, have been set out today by the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark.

The Coalition Government believes in a radical shift of power from the centre to citizens and communities, giving control and freedom back to people to manage their own lives as they see fit.

The Localism Bill, which begins its passage through parliament today, will provide the legislative foundation for putting power back into the hands of communities. But it will also require fundamental changes in the way government works at every level.

To achieve and maintain the radical shift in power, the Government has published  _Decentralisation and the Localism Bill: an essential guide_. Its sets out six actions central government will need to take to do things differently - in behaviour, expectation, and culture, which must go alongside the changes in law proposed in the Bill.

They are to:

  * **Lift the burden of bureaucracy** - by removing the cost and control of unnecessary red tape and regulation, whose effect is to restrict local action;
  * **Empower communities to do things their way** - by creating rights for people to get involved with, and direct the development of, their communities;
  * **Increase local control of public finance** - so that more of the decisions over how public money is spent and raised can be taken within communities;
  * **Diversify the supply of public services** - by ending public sector monopolies, ensuring a level-playing field for all suppliers, giving people more choice and a better standard of service;
  * **Open up government to public scrutiny** - by releasing government information into the public domain, so that people can know how their money is spent, how it is used and to what effect; and
  * **Strengthen accountability to local people** - by giving every citizen the power to change the services provided to them through participation, choice or the ballot box.

Nick Clegg said:

> ""The Coalition Government is different from governments that have gone before. It is different by its very nature: two parties coming together in the national interest marked a watershed in our politics. But the Coalition is different in its approach, too. Because instead of taking more power for the Government, the Localism Bill will give power away. This Bill, as this guide sets out, marks the beginning of a power shift away from central government to the people, families and communities of Britain.""

Greg Clark said:

> ""Britain has become one of the most centralised countries and it hasn't worked. Our public services have suffered because of bureaucratic micro-management by the centre, and public trust in our democratic institutions has been undermined, with people feeling they have little or no control.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is determined to redress the balance through a radical shift of power from the centre to citizens and communities. The actions in this guide, embodied in the Localism Bill, will drive our commitment to decentralise power across every department and every level of government - and return power to the people to whom it rightfully belongs.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1972672,Small firms and small shops across country tax break support revealed,"Figures being published today show how the country's 'small business capitals' are benefiting from dedicated double tax breaks, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.

The latest figures reveal the number and share of small firms and shops, for every area of the country, that received a rate reprieve in 2010-11. Local areas from all parts of the country are getting additional help, worth on average £670 for each qualifying firm, with the average total cost of relief now £1340. Around 330,000 will pay no rates at all over this period as a result of the extension of the Government's discount scheme.

The figures show that coastal areas are often England's small business capitals and are some of the biggest beneficiaries due to their high concentration of small firms and shops. For example, in Cornwall over 10,000 business properties are receiving discounts; with 3,000 in Bournemouth; while Suffolk Coast, North Norfolk, Poole, Southend, South Lakeland, Blackpool  and Scarborough are helping over 2000 properties each.

The area with the highest concentration of small businesses is Tendring where six out of every ten firms are getting a rate reprieve. All parts of the country are getting help - nearly 6,000 small firms in Bradford are getting the discount; nearly 5,000 in Durham, 2,000 in Harrogate; over 1,500 businesses in Enfield; Wakefield nearly 3,500; Shropshire 3,700; Sheffield 4,400; and Kirklees has over 5,000 small businesses getting relief.

Ministers are clear that helping small shops and businesses grow is a crucial part of rebalancing and rebuilding the economy. Small businesses report that business rates are the third biggest outgoing for local firms after rent and staff.

Last autumn the Government announced the doubling of the Small Business Rate Relief discount available for a year. The extension of the scheme is expected to offer an additional £340m worth of help for around half a million business ratepayers in England.

The doubling of the Small Business Rate Relief discount was introduced in October as part of the Government's commitment to support local enterprise and growth. At Budget it was announced, the extra relief will now continue until the end of September 2012.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""Small shop and firms are at the heart of our communities, and it has never been more important to support them as they help rebuild and re-grow this country's economy for the future.
> 
> These new figures show just how much difference doubling the business rate discount has made to the country's economic prospects, especially in our 'small business capitals' where there are a high proportion of small firms and shops.
> 
> ""Around half a million small firms and local shops on the high street have been given over £340 million worth of financial breathing space with this tax break.""

Ministers are determined that small firms shouldn't lose out on an average £1340 of tax relief. The Localism Bill, currently going through Parliament, aims to encourage take up of tax firms by small businesses by scrapping the legal requirement for ratepayers to fill in an application form.

The Government is also giving councils the power to set local discounts on business rates, provided that they are funded locally, allowing them to support the local firms and shops if they are struggling or encouraging new start-up enterprises.

### Notes to editors

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2072118,Smart app to help defuse fire danger,"Electrical Fire Safety Week - 23rd -29th January 2012

As shocking statistics show that half of all accidental house fires were caused by faulty or misused electrical equipment in 2010/11, the Fire Kills campaign is highlighting a smartphone app from the Electrical Safety Council which will help people defuse the danger in their homes.

From faulty fridges and forgotten irons, to overloaded plugs and dodgy wiring - electrical equipment can be an unnoticed fire hazard in the home.  And with the recent cold weather, many sockets could still be overloaded with additional space heaters and electric blankets.

In 2010-11, accidental fires in the home caused by faulty or misused electrical products resulted in nearly 40 deaths across the country. As part of Electrical Fire Safety Week - 23 - 29 January - we're asking people to look around their homes, identify all the potential risks and take extra care when using electricity.

The Electrical Safety Council's app helps people identify risks in their home and offers advice on resolving them.

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Electrical equipment is an inescapable part of all our lives, from essentials like heating and lights to luxuries like entertainment systems or beauty products. Half of all accidental fires begin with an electrical appliance, so it's really important to be sure that your electrics are in good working order and are used properly.
> 
> ""Most electrical fires start in the kitchen, so be extra careful with cooking equipment. Fire in the home can be devastating, but many of these fires are preventable. By following some simple steps, you can help keep you and your loved ones safe from fire.""

Lorraine Carney Senior Campaigns Manager at the Electrical Safety Council said:

> ""With electricity such an integral part of our lives it is understandable that people tend to take it for granted. But that doesn't mean we can forget basic safety precautions. There is a worrying gap between the public's perception of electrical danger and the reality, with people making simple yet potentially fatal errors that can be easily prevented""
> 
> ""The ESC's free 'Home Electrical Safety Check' app was designed to bridge that gap. We wanted to create something which people would find simple to use and hope that they will download it, check their homes and take corrective action"".

Every individual can take steps to help themselves by checking that the electrical equipment they use everyday is in good shape and is operated properly:

  * Don't overload plug sockets
  * Regularly check for worn or frayed wires
  * Unplug appliances when not in use
  * Keep appliances clean and in good working order
  * Consider using a Residual Current Device which works like a circuit breaker to protect against electric shocks and reduces the risk of electrical fires.

The Electrical Safety Council advises that heaters should be kept clear from curtains and furniture and should never be used for drying clothes. Your electric blanket should be unplugged before you go to bed, unless it has a thermostat for safe all-night use.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1861110,Smoking time bomb: cigarettes the most deadly cause of house fire fatalities,"Smokers urged to 'put it out, right out' on No Smoking Day 9 March.

Smokers are being reminded today that careless disposal of cigarettes is the single biggest killer in house fires. Habits such as smoking whilst drinking alcohol in the home or lighting up in bed are responsible for one in three (36 per cent) of all accidental house fires resulting in deaths.

With a steady decline in the number of smokers in England, the overall number of fires triggered by cigarettes is small, but with over a third of all fire deaths in the country attributed to cigarettes the proportion of fatalities is staggering.

To coincide with National No Smoking Day (9 March 2011), the Fire Kills campaign is urging smokers to realise the deadly dangers of lighting up in the home. Smokers not giving up should still be aware of the fire risks they face, cut out dangerous habits, install smoke alarms on every level of the home and test them weekly. A working smoke alarm means you are more than twice as likely to survive an accidental house fire.

Sheila Pendlesbury sadly lost her grandson Shaun in house fire triggered by a cigarette.  She said:

> ""Shaun was only 27 year old when he died. He had a daughter and a bright future ahead of him. His loss is something we as a family will have to live with. But it hurts enormously to know something as basic, as a working smoking alarm could have alerted him to the fire and possibly saved his life.""

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Without an early alarm system in place you could lose valuable escape time in a fire. Just two to three breaths of toxic smoke can render a person unconscious. As well as the health dangers, people need to be aware of the deadly risks of smoking in the home and how smoking materials can very quickly and easily lead to a fire.  When extinguishing cigarettes smokers must make sure they 'put it out, right out' and if possible refrain from smoking in the home at all.""

For smokers not ready to kick the habit this No Smoking Day, it is important to follow these simple precautions to prevent a fire at home:

  * put it out, right out! Make sure your cigarette is fully extinguished
  * fit a smoke alarm and test it weekly. A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999
  * never smoke in bed. Take care when you're tired. It's very easy to fall asleep while your cigarette is still burning and set furniture alight
  * avoid drugs and alcohol when smoking. It's easy to lose your concentration when using any sort of drugs or drinking alcohol, combined with cigarettes and this could be lethal
  * never leave lit cigarettes, cigars or pipes unattended - they can easily overbalance as they burn down
  * use a proper, heavy ashtray that can't tip over easily and is made of a material that won't burn.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2027835,Social Action Week: Baroness Newlove joins the breakfast shift at homeless day centre,"The Government's champion for Active Safer Communities, Baroness Newlove has joined staff cooking breakfast at London's largest voluntary sector day centre for homeless and vulnerable people.

All this week award winning international charity True Volunteer Foundation has been placing teams from the Department to work alongside staff at The Passage Day Centre in Victoria and their projects across London. They have helped with everything from redecorating a centre for people with physical and mental disabilities to supporting those currently homeless with CV writing and interview skills practice.

Creating a thriving 'civic service' by encouraging public servants who want to volunteer their skills and time to work with small community groups and grassroots activists is a key priority for Baroness Newlove.

![Image: Baroness Newlove at the Passage with Will Cochrane from the True Volunteer Foundation](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2027812.jpg)

Speaking at The Passage Day Centre, which offers a range of services to help homeless people transform their lives, Baroness Newlove said:

> ""It's great to help the Passage support homeless people to recover their lives, and be homed and find employment. I want to encourage public sector workers especially civil servants to volunteer in their communities and I am delighted that the Department for Communities and Local Government is doing just that. Addressing homelessness is part of their Departmental remit, and getting out into the community is an invaluable opportunity to get to know the people affected by polices.""

All staff across Whitehall are being encouraged to spend at least one day volunteering a year as part of the Government's commitment to turn the Civil Service into the 'Civic Service'. At the Department for Communities and Local Government staff are able to take up to six days paid volunteering leave.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Volunteering is of great benefit both for staff sharing their skills and experience and for the local community and voluntary groups they help. 
> 
> ""I've done a bit myself painting the railings on one of my local canal bridges, and I've booked in for some more time next month too.
> 
> ""The Government wants to see the civil service providing 30,000 volunteering days a year and this has been a great week to raise the profile of volunteering and encouraging many more to join in.""

Will Cochrane, Operations Manager at True Volunteers said:

> ""There have been a few wins for The Big Society this week. Civic Service is underway, grassroots community organisations benefited from much needed resources and eight True Volunteers donated their time, travel and telephone expenses over recent months to make this week a success and corporate partners helped fund the activities.""

Mick Clarke, Chief Executive of The Passage said:

> ""The mission of The Passage is to provide resources which encourage, inspire and challenge homeless people to transform their lives. With a volunteer to staff ratio of over 3:1, volunteers are crucial to The Passage achieving that mission. We have therefore been proud to be part of Social Action Week; in welcoming volunteers from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and True Volunteer Foundation (TVF) to support our work, and in encouraging many more to get involved and truly make a difference for some of the most disadvantaged people in our city.""

True Volunteers has provided and managed the external volunteering opportunities for staff during the Department's Social Action Week. A team of eight True Volunteers have placed staff in their projects across London. Volunteers at the Foundation are not only not paid for their work but they also do not claim personal expenses.

The Department will be sharing the experiences of its Social Action Week with other Government departments.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1937776,Somerset flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Somerset has been hoisted outside the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

The county of Somerset was a Norman creation. Following the defeat of the Saxons by the Normans in 1066, various castles were set up in Somerset by the new lords such as that at Dunster, and the manors was awarded to followers of William the Conquerer such as William de Moyon and Walter of Douai.

Somerset today has only two small cities, Bath and Wells, and only small towns in comparison with other areas of England. Tourism is a major source of employment along the coast, and in Bath and Cheddar. Other attractions include Exmoor, West Somerset Railway, Haynes Motor Museum and the Fleet Air Arm Museum as well as the churches and the various National Trust and English Heritage properties in Somerset.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Lord Lieutenant of Somerset, Lady Gass said:

> ""Somerset people can take pride in their local and national achievements. It is encouraging to know that the Somerset flag will be flying in London this week.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2075999,"Speak up, speak out: Holocaust Memorial Day 2012","Communities Secretary Eric Pickles paid tribute to those affected by genocide past and present, at an event to mark Holocaust Memorial Day.

Holocaust Memorial Day is a worldwide event held each year on the 27 January, commemorating all the communities that suffered as a result of the Holocaust and in subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur.

This year's theme 'Speak up, Speak out' focuses on the importance of vigilance against extremism, racism and discrimination in all of its forms and aims to motivate people individually and collectively, to ensure that the horrendous crimes committed during the Holocaust are neither forgotten nor repeated.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""It is vital that the lessons from the Holocaust are taught today and to future generations. Holocaust Memorial Day gives us an opportunity to find out more about what happened in Nazi Germany, Bosnia, Cambodia, Rwanda and Darfur. To look at why it happened; and to think about what we all need to do to make sure it never happens again.
> 
> ""This day is relevant to all of us. We all have an obligation to speak up and speak out against extremism and hate and challenge divisive views and discrimination where we see them.""

Organised by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, this year's commemorations are being marked with an art exhibition 'Learning Lessons from the Past, To Create a Safer, Better Future', already it has been visited by 200 children. People from across the country are also being encouraged to speak out against discrimination and sign a pledge against the language of hatred.

The Government supports the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust to supply resources for teachers and for the organisers of the hundreds of local events that take place in communities. Over the next year the Government is providing £750,000 funding to support local memorial activities.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1929351,St Austell leading the way in the drive for greener living,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has heralded the St Austell eco development for showing the rest of the country how to create the sustainable communities of the future.

The Minister visited St Austell to see how the council and developer are working with the local community to redevelop the area around six former China Clay mining sites into a flagship eco development.

On a visit to Par Docks, Mr Stunell saw how progress is being made on the frontline. The former commercial harbour and industrial facility is earmarked to be transformed into a new waterside neighbourhood of up to 600 low-carbon homes, as well as new leisure facilities and opportunities for employment.

Ministers believe communities like St Austell are a model for the green growth of the future, and their priority is to support schemes which have broad-based local support and achieve genuine improvements in sustainability.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""We risk losing our battle against climate change unless we make the built environment more sustainable. What we can see in St Austell is that eco development works when local people are brought on board and are involved in shaping proposals. Sustainable development cannot just be imagined in a policy document in Whitehall and then imposed on local communities who do not want it. What is needed is for all new homes to be well designed and built to high environmental standards, with schemes that have grassroots involvement and cater for the needs of local people.
> 
> ""It is clear that this country desperately needs more new homes that are genuinely environmentally sustainable and meet the needs of existing communities. I'm pleased to hear that this is being achieved in the clay communities around St Austell, and I urge other communities to follow their example.""

Par Docks is near the communities of Par and St Blazey, south east of St Austell. The masterplan for the site will regenerate the area, bringing the harbour setting into the 21st Century.

Proposals include:

  * a new waterside neighbourhood for between 500-600 homes
  * a new marina and waterfront facilities, including covered marketplace, boat storage and moorings and retail and leisure attractions
  * employment opportunities with marine employment quarter and business space offering waterfront access; and
  * facilities for local fishing boats to land and sell their catch on the dockside.

The site is looking to use a range of renewable energy sources, such as a biomass energy centre, water source heating and cooling, and rainwater harvesting.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1908464,Staffordshire flag flies above Whitehall,"The flag representing the historic county of Staffordshire has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

The county of Staffordshire probably first came into being in the decade after the year 913 which was the year in which Stafford - the strategic military fording-point for an army to cross the Trent - became a secure fortified stronghold and the new capital of Mercia.

The County symbol depicted on the flag, the Staffordshire Knot, is seen on an Anglian stone cross that dates from around the year 805 that still stands in Stoke churchyard. The Knot is thought to be either an ancient Mercian symbol or a symbol adopted from Celtic Christianity which was brought to Staffordshire by Lindisfarne monks around the year 650.

Eric Pickles, in a speech to the Flag Institute last week, said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Philip Atkins, Leader of Staffordshire County Council said:

> ""We are all incredibly proud of Staffordshire and it will be a pleasure to see it fly from the department's headquarters.
> 
> ""In Staffordshire we are proud of both our historic heritage and what we have around us today, and we have high hopes for the future. The county council is a leader in reforming local government services and we are gaining a national reputation for our work transforming how those services are delivered to our local communities.
> 
> ""Our county is a wonderful mix of traditional and modern. We have vibrant towns set in wonderful countryside. We are also attracting more and more hi-tech businesses that are helping lead the economic recovery.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1787549,Standing up for local taxpayers: Welsh Council Tax revaluation cancelled,"The UK Government today announced its intention to cancel planned council tax revaluation in Wales.

Measures in the forthcoming Localism Bill will also devolve the powers to decide the timing of council tax revaluations in Wales to Welsh Assembly Government Ministers. This removes the legal requirement to hold a revaluation in 2015, ten years after the last revaluation. Work on the revaluation was due to start in 2012-13.

A recent decision by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles stopped the council tax revaluation in England. He also reassured English taxpayers that there will be no unexpected revaluation hikes in the next five years.

As a result of the last council tax revaluation in Wales in 2005, four times as many homes moved up one or more council tax bands than moved down. Two-thirds of the net rises were amongst homes originally in Bands A to C. UK ministers believe this hit the less well-off households the hardest. The council tax revaluation was also accompanied by council tax rebanding.

UK ministers want to see Welsh taxpayers get the same certainty about revaluation. It will be a matter for the Welsh Assembly Government Minister to decide whether they will now issue the same reassurances to Welsh taxpayers as have been given to English tax payers. No revaluation will now take place unless the Welsh Assembly Government Minister determines otherwise.

Both England and Wales have seen significant rises in council tax since 1997, with Band D bills rising by 109 per cent in England and 128 per cent in Wales. A revaluation could further increase households' bills by pushing more people into higher bands. Moving from Band C to Band D increases yearly bills by a further 13 per cent, and from Band D to Band E by a further 22 per cent.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""We've confirmed that English taxpayers will not face an unwanted council tax revaluation hike, it's only right that Welsh taxpayers have the same protection.
> 
> ""The 2005 revaluation showed how this tax exercise was used as an excuse to push up bills for hard-working families and pensioners.
> 
> ""Hefty council tax bills are a constant financial worry for many people in England and Wales. The new UK Government wants to avoid any unnecessary and expensive revaluations that have lead to massive hikes in tax bills.""

Welcoming this decision Cheryl Gillan, Secretary of State for Wales said:

> ""We have decided to scrap the national rules that would have made council tax revaluation in Wales in 2015 compulsory This will now be a matter for Welsh Assembly Government Ministers and I hope they will move swiftly to give the same protection to Welsh taxpayers as the UK Government has given in England.""

### Notes to editors

1. The forthcoming Localism Bill will devolve the power to Welsh Assembly Government Ministers to decide the timing of council tax revaluations in Wales, rather than being bound to the timetable set out in legislation passed following the Local Government Act 2003. This will also cancel the legal requirement for a council tax revaluation in Wales that was due to take place in 2015. Work on the Welsh revaluation would have started in 2012-13. Ministers in Westminster have discussed this matter with the Welsh Assembly Government, and that they are in agreed with the proposed devolution of responsibility.

2. The Secretary of State for Local Government cancelled the revaluation in England that was due in 2015 with the Treasury: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1723670](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1723670).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1805807,Stay safe and warm this Christmas,"With the country in the grip of what's set to be the coldest December for 100 years, England's Fire and Rescue Services are advising their residents to stay safe as they keep warm and the colder weather continues to bite.

Latest fire statistics show that the number of injuries and deaths from accidental fires in 2008 were at their peak in December and January, while provisional statistics for 2009/10 show that nearly 2000 fires were started by electric blankets, candles or portable heaters last year, resulting in 406 casualties and fatalities.

Fire Minister Bob Neill said:

> ""As the colder weather continues to bite it's only natural that we spend more time indoors and endeavour to stay as warm as possible. There's nothing like a cosy open fire or the added warmth of an electric blanket, but these and other winter must-haves like candles can bring an increased risk of fire into the home.
> 
> ""Make sure you stay both warm and fire-safe this winter and remember to test your smoke alarm every week.  Working smoke alarms save lives.""

The Government's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:

> ""Additional measures to keep warm such as heaters are a common sight at this time of year but despite the winter comfort they can bring it's important to remember the risks they bring.
> 
> ""By following some simple rules you can ensure you stay safe and warm and if you are in any doubt over any fire safety issues, your local Fire and Rescue Service are on hand to help and offer advice. We all want to be warm in winter, but we must avoid tragedy.""

The Fire Kills Campaign has released the following advice to help you reduce your fire risk this winter:

#### Fires and Heaters

Open fires can provide a relaxing and atmospheric way to keep warm, whereas portable heaters can be handily moved around but it's important to use them safely:

  * always use a fire guard to protect an open fire against flying sparks and hot embers and make sure embers are under control and properly put out before you go out or go to bed
  * keep portable heaters away from curtains and furniture and never use them for drying clothes. Always unplug electric heaters when you go out and go to bed.

#### Electric Blankets

Electric blankets can help you keep warm during the cold nights, but fires can be devastating with 440 injuries resulting from every 1000 fires started by an electric blanket. Therefore, there are fire safety issues to consider:

  * never use hot water bottles in the same bed as an electric blanket, even if the blanket is switched off
  * unplug blankets before you get into bed, unless they have a thermostat control for safe all-night use
  * store electric blankets flat or rolled up or loosely folded to prevent damaging the internal wiring.

#### Candles

Candles may also be used more to lighten up the dark evenings. As with open fires, a naked flame brings risks if they are not treated carefully. Make sure that candles are secured in a proper holder, and away from materials that may catch fire like curtains. It is also very important that candles are put out completely when you leave the room or go to bed.

More and more students are choosing to study abroad and take the opportunity for a different educational and cultural experience. Last year a record 10,843 British students - a 6 per cent rise - took advantage of the Erasmus programme where students spend a year of their degree studying abroad.

Until now only those students studying full-time at UK institutions were exempt from council tax charges on their accommodation. Consultation proposals published today will restore fairness into the system by extending the student council tax exemption.

> ""It is only fair that those students who want to study full-time in Europe get the same council tax rights as they would studying in the UK.""

Bob Neill said:

> ""Students should be given every opportunity to get the best possible education.
> 
> ""Studying at European universities and institutions can be a rewarding life experience that stays with someone well beyond graduation. Money is a constant concern for students and people are put off because the costs involved can mount up.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1719857,Corrupt councillors will go to court not standards committees,"Serious misconduct for personal gain will be a criminal act, while petty local vendettas will no longer get a hearing as the unpopular standards board regime is axed, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

Mr Stunell said the top-down regime set up by central government to monitor council conduct had become a vehicle for malicious and frivolous complaints. For example, one authority had to fork out £160,000 after receiving over 170 complaints from the same person. Each one had to be examined, but only three were considered worth investigating and after investigation all were dismissed.

Local Standards Committees investigated 6000 complaints in the first two years - of which over half were judged not worthy of any further action. The Government is axing the entire Standards regime including the central board, which costs over £6 million a year; with investigations of complaints costing thousands of pounds each.

Genuine corruption in local government needs to be rooted out and the new Government is legislating to make serious misconduct a criminal offence dealt with by the courts not committees. Councillors will have to register certain personal interests in a publicly available register.

Ministers believe these changes will give voters the confidence that councillors who misuse their office will be effectively dealt with. While councillors themselves will have the confidence to get on with their job knowing they won't be plagued by petty allegations.

### Public will decide councillors' fates

Under new plans the public will also have greater confidence to challenge poor local services. The Government intends to give the Local Government Ombudsman, the established body for investigating public complaints over the way they have been treated by their council, reel teeth. For the first time local authorities will be legally compelled to implement the Ombudsman's findings.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The Standards Board regime ended up fuelling petty complaints and malicious vendettas. Nearly every council had investigations hanging over them - most of which would be dismissed but not before reputations were damaged and taxpayer money was wasted. Frivolous allegations undermined local democracy and discouraged people from running for public office.
> 
> ""That's why we are axing the unpopular and unelected standards board regime. Instead we will legislate to ensure that if a councillor is corrupt and abuses their office for personal gain they will be dealt with in the criminal courts. If a councillor behaves ineffectively or irresponsibly then it's a matter for the electorate not an unelected quango.
> 
> ""This Government is freeing councillors from central prescription and top down bureaucracy so they can get on with their job. In the future councillors must expect to be judged at the ballot box by an electorate with real access to their accounts and personal interests in a new transparent era.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles added:

> ""The standards board regime became the problem, not the solution. Unsubstantiated and petty allegations, often a storm in a teacup, damaged the reputation and standing of local government, as well as wasting taxpayers' money.
> 
> ""But by abolishing the failed standards committees we're not letting councillors off the hook. Failure to register or declare an interest, or deliberately seeking to mislead the public about an interest, will become a criminal offence while a newly empowered Local Government Ombudsman will investigate incompetence on behalf local people.""

The Government will also legislate to make it clear that councillors can campaign and vote freely on their issues. Councillors who have been prevented from speaking on the very issues they had been elected on, such as planning matters, will now have the freedom to express their views.

But councillors will have to register certain personal interests in a publicly available register; this could include anything that could reasonably be regarded as likely to influence or affect their actions, conduct when on business for the authority or voting.

The whole Standards Board regime consisting of a centrally prescribed code of conduct, standards committees with the power to suspend councillors and an unelected central body will be axed in the upcoming Localism Bill.

However councillors will have to conform to the highest standards of conduct. At present if a councillor abuses their position for personal gain it may result in a complaint to the local authority's standards committee with the councillor simply having to apologise. New legislation will make failing to register an interest, or deliberately seeking to mislead the public about an interest a criminal offence.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2008298,Stunell and Neville kick off revolution in tackling carbon emissions,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today joined ex-footballer and sustainability campaigner Gary Neville in Sheffield to open a revolutionary 'carbon negative' office - a building that produces more energy than it consumes.

The minister joined Mr Neville, a keen environmentalist and the founder of [Sustainability in Sport](http://www.sustainabilityinsport.com/home.html) (external link), to open the open the Old Corn Mill, near Penistone, in West Yorkshire.![Andrew Stunell and Gary Neville open Old Corn Mill](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2009085)

A combination of solar panels, two wind turbines and a water turbine powered by the River Don means that the new offices generate surplus energy that is put back into the national grid system, effectively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and giving the building an energy performance rating of A+. The average building in England is rated D.

Energy efficient features at the Old Corn Mill include triple glazing; substantial insulation; low-energy appliances; eco lighting, and underfloor heating using a geothermal water source beneath the car park.

Originally a 1750's three-story mill, the building has been carefully renovated using existing materials and the latest insulation and energy efficient materials to create a three storey office. The original structure is traditional 1750's cut stone but a new build extension has been added highlighting the blend of old and new.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""The built environment contributes almost half of the UK's carbon emissions each year and if UK is to play its part tackling climate change, we need to make our buildings more sustainable.
> 
> ""This new carbon-negative building is a prime example of how the offices on the future can work - generating not only enough energy to power themselves, but also others - as well as being practical and affordable.""

Sustainability champion Gary Neville said:

> ""It's great to see offices like this being built. It just shows that businesses as well as individuals can do their bit for the environment.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1719870,Stunell tells councils they can return to the committee system as Whitehall steps out of local affairs,"Councils will be able to run themselves under a system that works best for their area, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.

The new Government will let councils have a real choice and decide with local people what system is best for their community, whether that be a Mayor or Leader and Cabinet or a Committee system. In 2000 councils across the country were forced to give up committee systems and adopt a new executive model of governance prescribed by central government.

The move to let councils choose is part of the new Government's commitment to a localist approach, that will see Whitehall step back and trust communities to manage themselves.

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""For the last decade councils have been forced to implement a one-size fits all model of Government. This Government will let councils and communities decide how to organise themselves. We don't presume to know more than local people about how their area should be run.
> 
> ""The Coalition Government is committed to localism and pushing power away from Westminster and back to local communities. We're not going to be micromanaging, second guessing and interfering in local affairs anymore.""

Before the Local Government Act 2000, local authorities could either take all decisions in full council or could delegate decision making to committees, sub committees, other local authorities or officers.

The 2000 Act abolished the committee system, and required all local authorities with a population of 85,000 or more to adopt an executive model of governance with an Elected Mayor and Cabinet or Leader and Cabinet.

The new Government will allow councils to return to the committee system, should they wish to.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1618440,Stunell wins praise for ending council red tape,"The end to unnecessary red tape will save money and give councillors the freedom to express their opinions without the threat of being sidelined were announced by Local Government Minister Andrew Stunell.

In the first parliamentary questions for CLG's new ministerial team last week, Andrew Stunell confirmed that the Localism Bill would include legislation to scrap the expensive local government Standards Board meeting the commitment made in The Coalition Agreement.

In response, MPs (Peter Bone the Member for Wellingborough) suggested this would make Mr Stunell ""the pin-up boy for every councillor in the country"", and that he would now receive an enormous amount of fan mail.

Mr Stunell said:

> ""Around the country, there are councillors of every political persuasion deeply frustrated by the fact that the Standards Board remains a burden and a threat to them. It costs £7.8 million, but it dealt with only 1,000 real complaints last year, which is £7,800 per complaint. The sooner we get rid of it, the better. That will be done on a statutory basis through the decentralisation and localism Bill.""

Mr Stunell also informed Members of Parliament in an adjournment debate on 8 June that the Bill would also end the unfair practice known as 'predetermination' which bars elected council members from taking part in decisions where they had campaigned or expressed a predisposed view.

He added:

> ""It is absolutely the case that it is wrong for local representatives to be barred from taking part in decisions, even if they have a clear predisposed view. They may even have been elected on a particular issue, and it would of course then be deeply frustrating for them to receive apparently professional advice that disqualifies them from taking part. The Government certainly understand the concern that the issue causes to councillors, and if necessary, we will legislate to ensure that councillors are not prevented from speaking up on issues on which they have campaigned.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1782711,Go online to go green,"Mr Stunell urged all homeowners, landlords and tenants to go online and use a new tool that compares the different measures they can use to save energy, and crucially save money too.

Anyone looking to make their home more environmentally friendly can go to the new EPC Adviser, look up their Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and then click on the options available.

These can range from low-energy lighting, which can cost as little as £2.50 for new bulbs, to larger measures such as installing wind turbines and solar panels.

Consumers will also be able to see the savings they can make on their fuel bills, as well as the improvement they can make to the rating on their Energy Performance Certificate.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""More carbon emissions come from our homes than from our cars, so it is vital that we all play our part in reducing emissions from the built environment.
> 
> ""But despite receiving an Energy Performance Certificate, new owners landlords and tenants often don't know where to begin to make the necessary changes to 'green up' their home.
> 
> ""The EPC Adviser tool published today changes that. It gives valuable information on the things people can do - from using low-energy light bulbs and getting the loft insulated, to installing solar panels and wind turbines.
> 
> ""Those using this new online support will also be able to see the potential savings these measures can make to their energy bills, meaning they can save money as well as saving carbon. I would urge everyone with an EPC to go online and see what they can do to make their homes greener and cheaper to run.""

The EPC Adviser forms part of a wide range of measures the Government is taking to help reduce energy emissions from homes. The Green Deal will be a new and radical way of making energy efficiency affordable for all, whether people own or rent their property. The upfront finance will be attached to the building's energy meter. People can pay back over time with the repayments less than the savings on bills, meaning many can benefit from day one. It will help save carbon, energy and money off fuel bills. Legislation to put the Green Deal on a statutory footing will be introduced shortly.

In future, it is planned that the EPC Adviser will link directly to Green Deal providers and enable consumers to quickly and easily arrange for money saving improvements to be made to their home at no upfront cost .

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2061166,New site funding offers fairer deal for Travellers and the settled community,"Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today (7 January 2012) announced the successful bids for £60 million of funding that will provide hundreds of new authorised pitches as well as better facilities for travellers on official sites.

The Homes and Communities Agency have completed their assessment of bids and have recommended offers from successful councils and other organisations that will deliver over 750 new and improved pitches at a cost of £47m.

New bids for the remaining £13 million of the £60 million budget will continue to be considered and the Agency will help those who had their bids rejected to improve and resubmit their offers so that further pitches can be delivered over the next three years.

This new support for official traveller pitches goes hand in hand with action against unauthorised traveller sites. Through the Localism Act, the Government is introducing stronger powers for councils to tackle the abuse of retrospective planning permission. These strengthened powers are helping councils tackle any form of unauthorised development.

The new authorised travellers' sites will provide help to reduce the number of unauthorised sites, which create tensions between travellers and the settled community.

Ministers believe the previous system was ineffective because traveller site funding was allocated but often remained unspent. They also argue that by imposing top-down targets for traveller sites, local councils were compelled to encroach onto the Green Belt, leading to an increase in the number of unauthorised sites and seriously harming community relations.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""This funding will help provide sites in a way that reflects local need in consultation with the local community.
> 
> ""It will assist hundreds of traveller families find sites where they want to live and foster better relations with the existing communities and councils.
> 
> ""We are ending the failed system where Whitehall attempted to dictate where sites went. Instead we have brought back fairness by ensuring that both travellers and the settled population are treated equally.
> 
> ""New authorised sites, with the support of local communities, will be treated on an equal footing as new bricks and mortar homes, with councils getting powerful financial benefits for building authorised sites where they are needed.""

Today's announcement is the latest step to introduce a more local and fair way of providing sites for travellers. Other measures include:

  * strengthening measures to tackle any abuse of the planning system
  * stronger enforcement powers for councils
  * providing powerful cash incentives for councils to build authorised sites through the New Homes Bonus and
  * training for councillors about their leadership role in relation to traveller site provision and planning applications for sites.

### Notes to Editors

1. A total of 33 providers, of which 18 are local authorities and 15 housing associations, will receive allocations 617 new and 167 improved pitches at a total cost of £47m. For more information, a CSV file of the successful bids is available at:  
[www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sites/default/files/our-work/tpf_allocations_january2012.csv](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sites/default/files/our-work/tpf_allocations_january2012.csv) (CSV, 5.5 kb).

2. The programme delivers 10 pitches in London (one per cent of the total) for £700,000. The proportion going to London has been agreed by the GLA.

3. The Government, as part of their broader package of reforms to the planning system and desire to see everyone treated equally and even-handedly in respect of it, went out to consultation on a draft, short and light-touch, new policy on 'planning for traveller sites' last year. Responses to the consultation are currently being considered and the new policy will be published as soon as possible. The Secretary of State's original announcement can be seen at: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1886974](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1886974).

4. The overarching objective of the new travellers policy is to ensure fair and equal treatment for travellers in a way that facilitates their traditional and nomadic way of life while respecting the interests of the settled community. The new policy puts planning for traveller sites back in the hands of local planning authorities, aligns planning policy for traveller sites more closely with that of policy on planning housing and provides greater protection to Green Belt.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

As part of the Kingdom of East Anglia that was first settled by the Angles in the 5th century, Suffolk has a rich history. A county of great archaeological importance, Suffolk is renowned for archaeological finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Recently it is the home of some of Britain's finest agricultural produce and to iconic companies like the Greene King brewery and Birds Eye peas. Suffolk's picturesque countryside is known as 'Constable Country' and the county was the birthplace of both John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough - two of Britain's best regarded painters.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Mark Bee, Suffolk County Council's Leader, said:

> ""Suffolk is without a doubt one of the most beautiful corners of this country - so it's fantastic to be about to share it, and be proud of it, by flying our flag over the Department for Communities and Local Government. We take huge pride in Suffolk's rural charm, vibrant towns and its community-spirited way of life and would urge anyone to come and see it for themselves.""

The Budget announced that the Government would create 21 new Enterprise Zones, within local enterprise partnerships, with simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses, would be established in local enterprise partnerships across England. The areas will have real potential to create new businesses and jobs with wider economic benefits.

The first vanguard Enterprise Zones will be based in Birmingham and Solihull, Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, the Bristol area, the Black Country, Derby and Nottingham, Teesside and the North East.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has launched a scheme to identify where the remaining ten Enterprise Zones. He said that growth was this Government's number one priority and a new generation of Enterprise Zones were central to that strategy adding that the zones were unashamedly pro-growth would be ""a springboard for private sector growth and wider regeneration"".

John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said:

> ""The new enterprise zones could provide positive incentives for local authorities to promote development, allowing the Government to carry out a real-time experiment on what actually works as a spur to economic activity.""

John Walker, National Chairman, Federation of Small Businesses, said:

> ""We are pleased that the Chancellor has introduced a fuel duty stabiliser, has committed to cutting fuel duty and has introduced 21 new Enterprise Zones. This will provide much needed stability for struggling small businesses.""

David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce said:

> ""The announcement of 21 low-tax, low-regulation areas across England in the form of Enterprise Zones will boost our regional economies. The role of Local Enterprise Partnerships in designating and running Enterprise Zones will ensure that local business leaders are at the heart of the new policy. Beyond upfront incentives, the reinvestment of business rates locally is critical to boosting regional growth.""

British Retail Consortium Director General Stephen Robertson said:

> ""The Chancellor is right to seek to stimulate regional private sector growth, especially in parts of the country which have been particularly dependent on the public sector. Enterprise zones can make a difference at the margins but they must not disadvantage neighbouring areas.""

Dr Brian Sloan, Head of Business and Economic Policy at Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said:

> ""Given the challenges facing the Greater Manchester economy at this time, this announcement is obviously great news for the area. The new Enterprise Zone should provide employment opportunities for many people who will prosper from investment and development on this scale.""

George Cowcher, CEO of the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce, said:

> ""We're absolutely delighted that Nottingham has been chosen as the location of one of the first four Enterprise Zones. It's a fantastic coup which reflects the importance of Nottingham, a core city to the UK economy and a driver of private sector growth.""

Inventor and entrepreneur James Dyson said:

> ""These are real serious measures which will make it much more likely for people to invest in these high risk start-ups - and also for people with these technology ideas to want to do it themselves.""

Royal Institute of British Architects President Ruth Redd said:

> ""The RIBA welcomes the potential for streamlining the planning system and for promoting development in enterprise zones provided that they are achieved in a framework that protects the essential requirements of sustainability and good design.""

Alexandra Jones, boss of the Centre for Cities, said:

> ""They are locating the new zones in areas where there is a realistic chance of producing growth, rather than focusing on reviving rundown areas which weren't realistically going to produce new jobs.""

Gu desserts founder, James Averdieck, in reaction to the Enterprise Zones announcement in the Budget said:

> ""Continued growth in the economy is the only way Britain will emerge unscathed from the recession and I, for one, applaud the Chancellor's initiative.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1958014,Supporting more people back into work - councils to take the lead in boosting local economic prosperity,"Plans to put councils in charge of providing financial support for council tax which are designed to help more people back into work, maintain protections for pensioners and save the taxpayer up to £480 million a year have been published for consultation by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles today.

Under the existing system local authorities are responsible for council tax rates and collection but do not control the policy on council tax benefit, which is run centrally from Whitehall.

Ministers are proposing to bring all aspects of the council tax system together at local level, freeing billing authorities how best to support working age households and establish stronger incentives for councils to get people back into work.

The changes to these benefits sit alongside the Government's wider welfare reforms that are focused on ending a culture of benefit dependency and on making sure that it always pays to work.

Pensioners will be protected against any reduction in support. Today's consultation considers how best to protect other vulnerable groups.

The cost of council tax benefit to taxpayers is equivalent to almost £200 per household a year. The changes will help to deliver a 10 per cent reduction in the current £4.8 billion annual council tax benefit bill across Great Britain, resulting in significant savings for the taxpayer.

The proposals to put councils in charge of providing support for council tax are part of a wider decentralisation policy that will give local authorities increased financial freedoms and a greater stake in the economic future of their local area. The reforms will align benefits with the wider council tax system creating a simpler, streamlined system, reducing bureaucratic burdens and costs. The Royal British Legion has previously called for Council Tax Benefit to be re-labelled a council tax 'rebate'.

The reforms will also give councils stronger incentives to tackle benefit error and fraud which are currently estimated to cost councils around £200 million a year.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Plans to put councils in charge of providing support for council tax go hand in hand with wider economic reforms - such as the New Homes Bonus and our proposals for the local retention of business rates. In future, councils will have a much greater stake in the economic future of their area and greater incentives to support local residents back into work.
> 
> ""The new system will be a fairer one, where hard-working families and pensioners are not left to pick up a spiralling benefits bill and where work always pays.
> 
> ""Councils will be much better placed to attract new business and industry, better placed to help their residents get off welfare and reap the benefits of work instead. They will directly benefit from improving the prosperity of the local area that will in turn drive down their benefit bill.
> 
> ""Local authorities will have much greater freedom to administer rebates in a way that best meets local needs and best supports local people whilst safeguards will be put in place to protect the most vulnerable, including pensioners, from any reduction in the support that is on offer.""

The changes to the system will be introduced in 2013-14.

Plans to localise council tax benefit are intended to:

  * **give councils increased financial freedom and a greater stake in the economic future of their local area** - supporting the Government's wider agenda to enable stronger, balanced economic growth across the country.
  * **reduce expenditure on support for council by 10 per cent** - the reforms will create stronger incentives for councils to get people back into work and save taxpayers money - reducing the cost of benefits to hard-working families and pensioners.
  * **protect the most vulnerable in society**, particularly pensioners from any change in their level of support.
  * **enable councils to simplify the complex system of criteria and allowances** by aligning the support scheme more closely with the council tax system and so help reduce administrative costs.

Promoting work incentives is at the heart of the Government's programme of welfare reform. Ministers are clear that localised schemes should be delivered while supporting work incentives. One of the aims of localisation is to create stronger incentives for local authorities to get people back into work and support the positive work incentives that will be introduced through the Government's plans for Universal Credit.

2. Council tax benefit is an income-related social security benefit which may be claimed by an eligible individual who is liable to pay council tax in respect of their sole or main residence and who has submitted a claim to the relevant local authority.

In 2011 £4.8 billion was spent on council tax benefit in Great Britain and claimed by 5.8 million people.

Although council tax benefit is a national benefit with policy and rules set by central Government, it is administered by local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales.

The costs of council tax benefit are currently met by DWP from Annually Managed Expenditure.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1933153,Surrey flag flies above Whitehall,"The flag representing the historic county of Surrey has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government as part of the Department's celebration of county identity.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

The name Surrey is Saxon meaning ""South Ridge"" though later the name of the area was Sudergeona or ""southern"". Little remains of the Roman or the Saxon periods in Surrey. However there is an Iron Age hillfort at Holmbury Hill and remnants of the Roman roads Stane Street and Ermine Street.

The title of Earl of Surrey was awarded at the signing of the Great Charter (Magna Carta) at Runnymede, Surrey in 1215, in recognition of the county's loyalty during the rebellion that followed the death of William I of England.

Surrey is one of the most affluent and successful counties in the UK. It is home to such corporations as Toyota and Pfizer as well as famous sporting venues such as Epsom race course and Brooklands racing circuit.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Sussex and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

The Leader of Surrey County Council, Dr Andrew Povey, said:

> ""I am very proud that the Department for Communities and Local Government has chosen to fly Surrey's flag from it headquarters this week.
> 
> ""Surrey plays a central role in the wellbeing of our country, both financially and socially, so I see this as recognition of the hard work of our residents.
> 
> ""It is also fitting that this week we will be discussing the exciting future that lies ahead for local government at the Local Government Association annual conference.
> 
> ""Our close working relationship with the Department for Communities and Local Government means we are at a crossroads which promises to provide local government with freedoms that will benefit our communities for years to come.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1816643,Survey shows satisfaction among communities,"Most people are satisfied with their local area as a place to live, feel that they belong there, and believe that people in their community get on well with each other, survey results show.

The figures suggest that people feel a positive connection to their local area - a strong foundation on which the Big Society can develop.

The gap between the number of people who feel able to influence local decisions and those who think it's important to be able to (37 per cent and 73 per cent respectively) provides a good indication of the appetite in people for greater participation.

Measures in the Localism Bill will devolve power to local communities and make it easier for people to get involved in civic participation and volunteering.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""For the Big Society to work well, it's important that people get on with one another, feel some kind of attachment to the area in which they live and are involved in the decisions that affect them.
> 
> ""The figures out today suggest that, while there is an appetite for getting involved, there are lots of people out there who want to do something but either don't know how or feel they can't.
> 
> ""We want this to change. The measures in the Localism Bill and our drive to bust bureaucratic barriers will help to close this gap. Our actions will help create active, engaged communities, where the local people who know what's best for an area are trusted and equipped to get on with it and aren't held back by needless obstacles.""

The Localism Bill contains a radical package of reforms that will devolve greater power and freedoms to neighbourhoods, establish powerful new rights for communities, revolutionise the planning system, and give communities control over housing decisions.These reforms will give individuals and community groups the freedom and tools to improve their local areas to build their vision of the Big Society.

Today's findings, based on interviews conducted between April and September last year, show that more people than in recent years believe their area is improving and fewer are worried about being a victim of crime.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1921815,Sussex flag flies above Whitehall to mark Sussex Day,"The flag representing the historic county of Sussex has been hoisted above the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government to coincide with the county day of Sussex on 16 June.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

An ancient kingdom, originating in the late 5th century, Sussex has a rich history. As the location of the Battle of Hastings, infamous persecutions during the Reformation and the Swing Riots in the 19th century and Sussex has played a central role in the shaping of English life. It's verdant, undulating topography and spectacular coastline make it a popular holiday and tourist destination whilst the 'seven good things of Sussex' (Pulborough eel, Selsey cockle, Chichester lobster, Rye herring, Arundel mullet, Amberley trout and Bourne wheatear) reveal the county's culinary delights.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Sussex and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

The 16 June is the feast day of Saint Richard of Chichester, Sussex's patron saint. It was generally believed that miracles were wrought at Richard's tomb in Chichester cathedral, which was long a popular place of pilgrimage, and in 1262 he was canonized at Viterbo by Pope Urban IV.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Bradley Ells of the Sussex Association said:

> ""The County of Sussex is almost 1300 years old and originates as the Kingdom of the South Saxons. We are hugely proud that the recently adopted Sussex flag is being flown outside the offices of the DCLG on the same week as Sussex Day, 16 June, the feast day of Sussex's patron saint, Saint Richard of Chichester.""

Louise Goldsmith, Leader of West Sussex County Council said:

> ""I am very proud that the flag will be flying on Sussex Day which we see as a great opportunity to encourage our local communities and residents to celebrate all that is best about our county and its rich heritage.""

Councillor Peter Jones, Leader of East Sussex County Council said:

> ""Our flag will be flying at our main Council HQ. We are very lucky to live in one of the most beautiful counties in the UK, with the Sussex Downs, the High Weald and our fantastic coastline to enjoy. Throw into the mix our rich heritage and our wonderful villages and towns and you have what we believe is the best County in the UK.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1607787,Swapping bin bullies for recycling rewards,"Plans to impose bin taxes have been scrapped by Cabinet ministers Eric Pickles and Caroline Spelman.

At the launch of the country's first ever council-run recycling reward scheme, Ministers dismissed 'pay as you throw' taxes because they would lead to more fly-tipping to dodge fines, saying people should be given incentives to recycle not punishments.

![Eric Pickles and Caroline Spelman at the launch event](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1609809.jpg)Some of the rewards that can be claimed with points earned through the recycling scheme.

The voluntary reward scheme in Windsor and Maidenhead lets residents can earn points for recycling to spend at local shops, from a free cup of coffee or a discounted eye test, to deals on spa treatments and local restaurants.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said:

> ""Rather than helping the environment, bin taxes would have fuelled fly-tipping and backyard burning. The best way to encourage people to recycle is not to punish families, but to encourage and reward them for going green. It's time to rein in the bin bullies and work with local people to build greener and cleaner communities.""

Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said:

> ""Windsor and Maidenhead Council have got it right by rewarding people for voluntarily doing the right thing not penalising them for doing the wrong thing - that is how we can change behaviour, improve the environment and get people to play their part in a Big Society.
> 
> ""That is why we are here today supporting the first ever council-run scheme in the UK to give residents reward points or cash vouchers for recycling.""

60,000 households in Windsor and Maidenhead can volunteer to claim up to £135 worth of points a year from over 100 reward partners, at no cost to other residents. The scheme will also mean that less recyclable waste will go to expensive landfill, saving the council money.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2052313,Tackling troubled families,"Plans to radically transform the lives of the country's most troubled families were today announced by the Prime Minister David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.

Almost £450 million has been made available in a new, determined, cross-government drive to turn around the lives of 120,000 of some of the country's most troubled families by the end of this Parliament.

New figures show that troubled families cost the tax payer an estimated £9 billion per year, equivalent to £75,000 per family. This is spent on protecting the children in these families and responding to the crime and anti-social behaviour they perpetrate. The costs are exemplified by the fact that children who live in troubled families are 36 times more likely to be excluded from school and six times more likely to have been in care or to have contact with the police.

A new Troubled Families Team based within the Department for Communities and Local Government and headed by Louise Casey CB, has been established to join up efforts across Whitehall, provide expert help to local areas and drive forward the strategy.

The £450 million means the Government will offer up to 40 per cent of the cost of dealing with these families to local authorities - but on a payment-by-results basis when they and their partners achieve success with families. For the first time, the Government has outlined the headline goals and how success will be measured with the following, straightforward, criteria:

  * children back into school
  * reduce their criminal and anti-social behaviour
  * parents on the road back to work, and
  * reduce the costs to the taxpayer and local authorities.

The new programme will also fund a national network of Troubled Family 'Trouble-Shooters' who will be appointed by local councils. The trouble-shooters will oversee the programme of action in their area. Their responsibilities will include making sure the right families are getting the right type of help, that sanctions are in place when needed, and that positive results are being achieved with the troubled families in their area.

This will be backed by a new, concerted national push from the Government to give this vital work a renewed impetus and higher profile, but also build on the successful work already going on in areas of the country.

The Prime Minister, who formally launched the programme during a visit to a Family Intervention Centre in Sandwell, said:

> ""Last year the state spent an estimated £9 billion on just 120,000 families, around £75,000 per family. Our heart tells us we can't just stand by while people live these lives and cause others so much misery. Our head tells us we can't afford to keep footing the monumental bills for social failure. So we have got to take action to turn troubled families around.
> 
> ""This immense task will take new ways of thinking, committed local action, flexibility and perseverance. But I know too that it's a task we can't shirk. People in troubled families aren't worthless or pre-programmed to fail. I won't allow them to be written off. So we must get out there, help them their lives around and heal the scars of the broken society.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles added:

> ""120,000 families are a big problem for this country. If you live near one you know very well who they are. And local services like police, health and schools also know who they are, because they spend a disproportionate amount of time and money dealing with them.
> 
> ""These families are both troubled and causing trouble. We want to get to the bottom of their problems and resolve them - for their own good, and for the good of their communities.""

The Local Government Association Chairman, Sir Merrick Cockell, in support of the announcement, said:

> ""Improving lives for families and residents is at the heart of what councils do and closer working between public sector agencies like job centres, schools, police, probation officers and social services locally will get better results and cost less.
> 
> ""It is great news that the money announced today will go to local areas to build on much excellent work already underway. We must ensure this support gets to where it is most needed and is not tied up in endless bureaucracy and form filling.
> 
> ""We are pleased Government has recognised the need for all departments to work much more closely with councils at a local level. This is vital to help us overcome historic hurdles which have stood in the way of the huge savings and greater local accountability this coordinated approach can deliver.""

The Government has also released the estimated number of troubled families in each upper-tier local authority area based on indicative numbers in previous government research. These are based on a family suffering from five out of seven specified disadvantages.

Councils will now be asked to look to identify actual families, based on factors such as truanting, antisocial behaviour and cost to public services.

Simultaneously, the Department of Work and Pensions announced that some European Social Fund funding will be used to help some of the country's most disadvantaged families get back on their feet and into jobs. The programme will provide targeted and personal support for tens of thousands of families and will be delivered by leading welfare to work providers working with local authorities and local organisations.

### Notes to editors

1. A troubled family is one that has serious problems and causes serious problems. In every troubled family there are a range of factors including parents not working, mental health problems, kids not in school, the family causing crime and anti-social behaviour and costing local services a lot of time and money routinely responding to these problems.

2. The £9 billion estimate comes from government figures and is the cost to both central and local government of the most troubled 120,000 families. £8 billion of the £9 billion is spent purely on reacting to the trouble caused and experienced by these families. Currently, only £1 billion of the £9 billion is spent on targeted interventions which could be taken as helping turn the troubled families' lives around. This equates to an average cost of £75,000 per family.

3. There are compelling reasons for turning troubled families around. Download infographics from Flickr [www.flickr.com/photos/number10gov/sets/72157628427403485/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/number10gov/sets/72157628427403485/) (external link).

4. Cost effectiveness of family intervention can be seen in the following example:

A Hertfordshire family consisting of six people of which four children were living with their mother and who were all subject to a protection plan. Children's services were considering legal proceedings to remove all the children including an unborn baby. Two other children were living with their paternal family. The mother was involved in a number of relationships which have been abusive and were fuelled by drug and alcohol abuse. There were a number of health problems, including mental health as well physical problems that left the mother needing crutches.

The family fully engaged with the intensive family intervention and the key worker worked in partnership with the whole family. A clear multi-agency plan was put in place and all agencies and family worked in partnership. This resulted in the children being taken off the protection plan although they were still children in need. There had been reported improvements from all agencies, school issues had improved, and the mother was coping well with the baby and is engaging with the children's centre. She had also attended a Strengthening Families parenting course, and was able to transfer the skills she learnt to her family.

As a result of the intervention Hertfordshire estimated that they were able to avoid costs of £112,688.

5. The evaluation report, Monitoring and Evaluation of Family Intervention Projects And Services between February 2007 And March 2011, by the National Centre for Social Research, published today, shows that intensive intervention to support and challenge troubled families is effective in turning their lives around. For instance:

  * 81 per cent of families engaging in anti-social behaviour at the start of the intervention fell to 34 per cent when they finished
  * 35 per cent of families involved in crime had fallen to 20 per cent
  * 58 per cent of families that had children truanting, excluded or behaving badly at school fell to 28 per cent.

The report has also shown, for the first time, there is a real impact of the programme controlling for other influences on family outcomes. A family getting intensive support and challenge is twice as likely to stop anti-social behaviour as one not getting the intervention.

A summary of the report is available here: [www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-RR174](http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-RR174) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1882271,Tenant Cashback set to reward house proud council tenants,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today offered tenants a Cashback deal worth billions to take control of their own homes.

Launching Tenant Cashback, Mr Shapps said there are millions of social housing tenants who take great pride in looking after their homes - and that he thinks ""it's about time we make it worthwhile for many more tenants to show this kind of responsibility"".

Social housing landlords responsible for England's more than 4 million social homes spend an average of £1000 per property annually on repairs - maintenance that tenants could, very often, do themselves, saving landlords money in the process.

Tenant Cashback will allow residents to take more control of their repairs budgets for their homes, for example carry out their own DIY, or commission it locally and pocket any savings made. Cash they could use however they want - for example, towards a deposit on their own house.

With maintenance and repair costing £4billion a year, the move could see a bonanza for small businesses - local painters, plumbers or carpenters - as more of the money is spent locally.

Community groups will also be able to take on the repairs on a particular street or neighbourhood, helping out those who cannot take on the responsibility themselves. Tenants will be able to pool their resources, creating a 'Community Cashback' account which could be used to fund improvements to the local area for the benefit of all residents.

The Government wants all landlords to offer their tenants the chance to manage more of their repairs budgets - and will consult on bringing forward changes to regulations to give all tenants the option to request it from their landlord.

But no tenant will be obliged to take on any more responsibility than they choose and the scheme won't place any new cap on maintenance budgets.

Greater involvement of tenants can only be a good thing for landlords too - who look to benefit from cutting out routine tasks that cost them a lot in administrative time and money. Good landlords also see the benefits from encouraging more tenants to stand on their own two feet, and to work closely with their neighbours and wider community.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Social housing should act as a springboard to help people make better lives for themselves. When residents take pride in their homes it saves their landlords cash, so I think it's right that tenants should benefit too.
> 
> ""Tenant Cashback will do just that, giving house-proud residents more control over looking after their own homes. Doing your own DIY or choosing a local handyman to do the work - will allow tenants to pocket any savings they make.
> 
> ""And if house proud tenants drive down the total cost of maintenance then this could lead to tenants receiving cheques in the post worth thousands of pounds, for them to use however they wish.""

### Notes to editors

Mark Henderson, Chief Executive, Home Group - one of the country's largest social landlords, managing 52,000 homes, said:

> ""We believe this scheme offers a real chance for customers to take responsibility for the upkeep of their homes and neighbourhoods, while making savings and potentially gaining practical and transferable employment skills. It is certainly a proposal that could radically change the way organisations like ours operate and rewarding customers for taking on aspects of maintenance is an idea which we have for some time agreed merits exploration. For this reason, we are happy to pilot the scheme and help assess what benefits it could deliver for our customers.""

Sue Chalkley, Chief Executive of Hastoe Housing Association - a landlord of over 4000 properties, commented:

> ""This initiative fits well with our strategy to find new ways of providing value for money and, with our combination of a young resident profile, low turnover and local community strategies; we are expecting the pilot to be a success. I am sure there are residents who will welcome this opportunity to work with us to keep their homes in good repair.""

Green Vale Homes, who manage 3700 homes, said:

> ""Green Vale Homes, alongside our partner organisations within the Together Housing Group, welcome the opportunity to develop the tenant cash back idea.
> 
> ""This initiative builds on the work we already undertake with tenants to improve skills, provide training and develop employment opportunities.
> 
> ""Our Reward Empowerment and Participation scheme, now in its second year, has proved a success with tenants collecting points for participating in a range of events or meetings for cash reward.
> 
> ""We will be working with our tenants to develop the new scheme further and encourage them to undertake certain repairs within their own homes and communities and to develop skills that may lead to employment.
> 
> ""We believe that this scheme has the potential to benefit tenants, their families and to make a difference to their community.""

Cllr Clyde Loakes Vice Chairman of the Local Government Association's Housing and Environment Board said:

> ""The vast majority of people living in council homes are responsible and sensible tenants, and landlords are glad to let them take proper responsibility for the upkeep of their homes. It is right that the approach should be piloted so risks can be identified and responded to.
> 
> ""Like any other landlord, local authorities need to be able to ensure that maintenance work on their properties continues to be done safely and to a high standard. So landlords need to be able to ensure work affecting gas, electric and fire safety is done properly.
> 
> ""This is vital to making sure this scheme achieves its aim of rewarding tenants and driving down costs without inadvertently exposing councils to a tidal wave of law suits and hefty repair bills for rectifying DIY disasters.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1740305,Tenant Services Authority to be abolished: new powers for tenants to improve social housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps today announced the abolition of the Tenant Services Authority (TSA), preserving its vital economic regulation functions in a new streamlined Homes and Communities Agency, whilst scrapping tasks considered unnecessary by Ministers - such as excessive data gathering.

The end of the TSA is part of wider Government reforms of public bodies announced today by Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude. These changes will radically increase the transparency and accountability of public services, and restore political accountability for decisions which affect people's lives and the way taxpayers' money is spent.

Today's move will put local people in real control of driving up the quality of social housing with their landlords, and keep regulation's primary focus on ensuring that lenders have confidence to invest in social housing. It follows a wide-ranging review of the TSA commissioned by Mr Shapps in June - part of the Government's wider agenda of reducing the number and cost of quangos, cutting unnecessary bureaucracy and getting better value for money for the taxpayer.

Under the plans, England's eight million social housing tenants will receive strengthened powers to ensure that their landlords provide quality housing and are held to account when problems arise. Landlords will be expected to support tenant panels - or equivalent bodies - in order to give tenants the opportunity to scrutinise the services being offered and to be involved in resolving disputes.

In a new era of transparency landlords will need to agree with their tenants what information they need about performance so that tenants can effectively scrutinise performance. And there will be a new role for tenants' representatives - local councillors, MPs and tenant panels - in standing up for the rights of tenants and driving up housing standards.

Full details of the review of social housing regulations will be published next week.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The Tenant Services Authority was set up to oversee the financial viability of social housing and to protect tenants. The Coalition Government is deeply committed to both of these important roles. But in practice the TSA made little difference on the ground with far too many tenants still frustrated by their lack of real power to drive up standards.

Details of how the Government plans to streamline the Homes and Communities Agency will be announced shortly. Today's announcement will affect 24 Publics Bodies accountable to Communities and Local Government.

### Notes for editors

1. The Tenant Services Authority (TSA) was created by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 and is the regulator for nearly 1,800 social housing landlords, including housing associations, councils and co-operatives in England. On 1 April 2010, the TSA commenced regulation with its new powers and based on a common set of standards applicable to social housing landlords.

2. The TSA's budget for 2010-11 is approximately £33 million.

3. Summary of review findings:

  * The Tenant Services Authority (TSA) should be abolished and its economic regulation and backstop consumer regulation functions transferred to the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), generating efficiency savings in back-office functions and exploiting synergies across investment and regulation.
  * In order to ensure the continued independence of regulation, these functions should be vested in a statutory committee within the HCA, legally separated from HCA's investment functions and with its membership appointed by the Secretary of State.
  * The role of consumer regulation should be refocused on setting clear service standards for social landlords and addressing serious failures against those standards, with a higher legal threshold for regulatory intervention.
  * Greater onus should be placed on local mechanisms to address routine problems and to enable tenants to hold their landlord to account and press for better services. There should be a clearer role in the complaints process for locally elected representatives and tenant panels in advocating for tenants.
  * In order to maintain lender confidence and protect taxpayers, proactive economic regulation of housing associations should continue as now but with more focus on value for money for the taxpayer.

4. 24 Public Bodies accountable to Communities and Local Government will be affected by the proposals in today's announcement. It is proposed that 17 will no longer be public bodies through abolition, devolution, reconstitution or merger (this includes the Audit Commission whose audit functions will be moved to the private sector - details at: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1688109](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1688109) ); six will be retained and the future of the Homes and Communities Agency is still under consideration. (Three executive agencies of the Department were out of scope of the review). [http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/)

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1924072,"The A, B, C of 'can do' councils protecting services","Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has praised three 'can do' councils who are acting to protect frontline services and local council tax payers.

The nation faces an unprecedented financial situation and every part of the public sector, including local government, which accounts for a quarter of all public expenditure, has a part to play. Many local authorities are showing they can protect frontline services without raising council tax. Councils' revenue spending is still just under £53 billion this year.

Mr Pickles said he was putting councils in the driving seat to use their new freedoms to ask big questions about how services are run and offer the best possible value to the taxpayer. He added that the best would not deliver the same old services in the same way. Many councils are showing the way across the country.

**Adur** in Sussex were the first local Authorities to set up a partnership working scheme with Worthing by sharing services and a single Chief Executive and management team. Now four years on they have made procurement savings of £2 million and revenue savings of over £3 million to date, with more to come, lowering their base budgets by £25 per cent or £2.5 million whilst protecting services. This included over £1 million through sharing services. Adur's spending power for 2011-12 is just over £10 million.

In 2009-10 they started saving £652,000 a year from sharing refuse and recycling, street cleansing, financial services, legal and democratic services, corporate services, and customer services. And last year (10/11) further savings of £350,000 a year were made by extending the arrangement to planning, parks, IT, building surveying, and environmental health.

**Bury** Council has taken steps to reduce blue badge fraud. A recent check of the 12,000 blue badges issued by the council found that 224 permits belonged to persons found to be deceased, had not been returned or were still be in circulation.

Bury introduced a new permit application procedure aiming to be more consistent, fair and timely for the customer. It will cut down on fraudulent abuse and to save taxpayers at least £4,000 a year.

People will only be able to apply online or by phone but they must collect their own permits in person. Council staff will validate personal information with benefits service staff to ensure people are entitled to claim. It will not change a person's entitlement to a blue badge.

Mr Pickles recently published a 10 point blueprint devised by experts at the national fraud authority to tackle £2 billion fraudulent practices being inflicted on local government.

**Cornwall** Council, a new unitary and one of the largest in the country, is showing quick action can make a real difference to tighter finances. Within a week of the Comprehensive Spending review they had agreed £170 million of savings over four years with £9 out of every £10 coming from efficiencies including senior management, properties and duplication. They also took immediate steps to save £75 million that year having calculated that each weeks delay would cost an additional £300,000.

Services to vulnerable people and essential services that affect everyone were prioritised for protection. Up to £10 million of the savings were identified from the pay bill. This included a Chief Executive pay cut and an elected Members vote to reduce allowances by 23 per cent. On procurement they also streamlined their waste collection contracts from six to one council wide contract cutting a £25 million cost by £3 million and providing a better service. The Settlement saw the council's spending power reduced by 3.26 per cent in 2011-12.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""Adur, Bury, Cornwall - that's an ABC of can do councils protecting the services their communities' value with creative thinking. There are many more showing residents and councils that where there is a will there is a way for local authorities to keep taxes down and protect frontline services. It leaves me in no doubt that local communities have the talent and initiative to harness the new powers coming their way.
> 
> ""Driving down the nation's deficit is the Governments biggest priority but we have made sure that extra money is available to protect the public from council tax rises offering real help to hard working families and pensioners. The new localism powers and spending freedoms we are handing councils will help them be as efficient and effective as possible.""

Government distributed £29.4 billion of council grant fairly between different parts of the country - north and south, rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. As a result councils will only see an average 4.4 per cent reduction in revenue spending power and none will now face more than an 8.8 per cent fall. In addition all councils have been given a share of £650 million for signing up to Government council tax freeze initiative.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1765384,The Audit Commission - appointment of new commissioners,"Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced three appointments to the Audit Commission Board, as the Government presses ahead with plans to move the audit function of the organisation into the private sector.

In September the Minister for Local Government announced that new commissioners would be recruited to the Board. Brian Landers, Janet Baker and Tony Harris have been appointed following open competition. The three individuals bring significant private sector expertise that will be crucial in steering the organisation as it addresses new challenges.

The Secretary of State has also extended Jennifer Dixon's term on the Board, so that her expertise on health matters can continue to be utilised by the Commission.

Eric Pickles the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said:

> ""I am pleased to announce the appointment of Brian Landers, Janet Baker and Tony Harris as commissioners on the Audit Commission Board. They will bring significant private sector expertise to the Board.
> 
> ""Jennifer Dixon has made a valuable contribution to the work of the Commission and I am delighted to announce that she will be able to continue supporting the Commission through its transition.
> 
> ""Our plans to refocus audit on helping local people and to move the audit expertise of the Commission into the private sector will pass power down to people, replace bureaucratic accountability with democratic accountability and save the taxpayer some £50m a year. The skills and expertise these individuals bring to the Commission will be crucial in managing the smooth transition of the organisation to the private sector in the coming months.""

The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced in August plans to disband the Commission after 2012 and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

Subject to Parliament enacting the necessary legislation, local audits will be regulated within a statutory framework overseen by the National Audit Office and the profession. Councils will appoint their own independent external auditors and there will be new audit arrangements for local health bodies.

The Audit Commission's in-house audit practice, which is the fifth largest audit practice in the country, is to be transferred out of public ownership after 2012. Over the next year a range of options will be developed for converting the audit practice into a business independent of Government which could be sold or otherwise transferred into the private sector.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1988981,The Audit Commission - appointment of new commissioners,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has today announced that Robert Light has been appointed to the Audit Commission Board, as the Government presses ahead with the disbandment of the Commission and the outsourcing of the work of its audit practice to the private sector.

Councillor Light joins as the Conservative representative on the Board and brings considerable knowledge and experience which should assist the Commission during this period of change. The Commission has three 'political' posts on the Board, representative of the three main political parties and reflective of the Commission's principal stakeholder - local authorities. This appointment follows the resignation of Sir Merrick Cockell, the previous Conservative representative who left to take up his post as Chair of the Local Government Association.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""I am pleased to announce the appointment of Robert Light. He brings significant practical public sector experience to the Board. His extensive links and knowledge of the Commission's work will prove invaluable to the Board.""

Eric Pickles announced in August 2010 plans to disband the Commission and refocus audit on helping local people hold councils and local public bodies to account for local spending decisions.

Subject to Parliament enacting the necessary legislation, local audits will be regulated within a statutory framework overseen by the National Audit Office and the profession. Councils will appoint their own independent external auditors and there will be new audit arrangements for local health bodies.

On 5 September 2011, the Audit Commission launched a process to outsource the work of its in-house audit practice to the private sector, including a potential employee-led company.

### Notes to editors

1. Councillor Robert Light has been a member for Kirklees Council since 1987. He is currently the Deputy Chair of the Local Government Association and an IDeA (Improvement and Development Agency for Local Government) peer. He has been part of a Comprehensive Performance Assessment team for four local authorities and brings considerable experience from his involvement in the close down of Firebuy ltd. He is currently a Board member of the Environment Agency. He receives £16,802 per annum (2010-11).

2. The appointment will cover the period from 14 September 2011 to 31 December 2012. The Commissioners will be paid £14,358 per annum based on a time commitment of 3 days per month. The appointment has been made in accordance with the Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies - The Commissioner for Public Appointments. Councillor Light's political activity has been declared to the Department.

3. The Audit Commission was established in 1983 to appoint auditors for councils, NHS bodies (excluding Foundation Trusts), police authorities and other local public services across England.

4. DCLG launched a consultation on the Future of Local Audit on 30 March 2011. The consultation period closed on Thursday 30 June and we are currently analysing responses received. Following consideration of responses to the consultation, we will publish our proposals in a draft bill to allow full Parliamentary scrutiny. A final bill will then be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows.

5. The Audit Commission began a procurement process on 5 September to outsource the work of its in-house audit practice with effect from 2012-13. This follows Ministers conclusions that outsourcing was likely to offer the best value for money, as well as being the quickest and, in their view, the most straightforward option for transferring the work to the private sector. Ministers therefore asked the Commission to design a fair and competitive procurement process that would allow a range of firms to bid for the work. At its meeting on 28 July 2011, the Commission Board agreed to undertake the procurement exercise. Ministers announced the decision on the same day.

6. The Labour representative on the Audit Commission Board is Stephen Houghton and the Liberal Democrat Commissioner is Sir David Williams, who was appointed on 6 July 2011.

#### Ancient woods are protected

The claims by the Woodlands Trust that the Government is considering the weakening of planning protection on ancient woodland is simply untrue (report, 21 February 2011). There are no such planning changes being proposed. No government document has ever floated the downgrading of such protection. The Coalition Agreement actually commits the Government to protecting important environmental planning designations.

The Coalition Government is seeking to consolidate the 1,000 pages of Whitehall planning policy guidance into a shorter document. This will not undermine the local environment. Protection for ancient woodland in the existing guidance will be carried over. It will also help make the planning system more accessible to the public.

At present, only full-time planning professionals - from lawyers, to developers, to council officers, to NGOs - are fully able to navigate through these 25 volumes. Pruning such excessive government paperwork may actually save a fair few trees from the paper mill.

At Budget the Government announced 11 Enterprise Zones in some of the country's largest cities, including Manchester, Birmingham, Merseyside and Newcastle, as well as inviting applications for 10 more in other areas.

The strength of the applications from Local Enterprise Partnerships was such that Government has agreed to increase this invitation to 11. The location of Zones in the Black Country, Tees Valley and the North East have also been agreed today. This brings the total to 22 Enterprise Zones across the country, helping to create thousands of new jobs by 2015. The Zones will attract hundreds of new start up firms, with simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and over £150 million tax breaks for new businesses over the next 4 years.

Alongside the new Zones, the Government is also announcing today that it will make enhanced capital allowances available for plant and machinery investment to a limited number of Enterprise Zones in Assisted Areas, including the Tees Valley and North East. With effect from 2012, companies setting up in these areas will be eligible to claim enhanced first year allowances for plant and machinery, giving them an upfront cash flow benefit.

The introduction of Enterprise Zones is just one of over 100 reforms being taken forward as part of the Government's Plan for Growth, announced at Budget 2011, to create the conditions for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.

The second wave of Enterprise Zone will be located in:

  * Humber Estuary Renewable Energy Super Cluster;
  * Daresbury Science Campus in Warrington;
  * Newquay AeroHub in Cornwall;
  * The Solent Enterprise Zone at Daedalus Airfield in Gosport;
  * MIRA Technology Park in Hinckley Leicestershire;
  * Rotherwas Enterprise Zone in Hereford;
  * Discovery Park in Sandwich, Kent and Enterprise West Essex in Harlow;
  * Science Vale UK in Oxfordshire;
  * Northampton Waterside;
  * Alconbury Airfield, near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire; and
  * Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, and Lowestoft in Suffolk.

Ministers are urging areas that missed out today to remain ambitious and pursue their innovative ideas to foster local enterprise.

The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:

> ""We are determined to do everything we can to make Britain the best place in the world to start and grow a business.
> 
> ""Enterprise Zones are a major step towards delivering this; cutting business taxes, easing planning restrictions and giving business the tools they need to invest and expand.
> 
> ""These new Enterprise Zones will be trailblazers for growth, jobs and prosperity throughout the country.""

The Chancellor, George Osborne, added:

> ""It is vital that we create balanced economic growth across the country. It is time for us to help every part of the country to grow and realise its potential.
> 
> ""Enterprise Zones are a critical part of our Plan for Growth and will support economic development and create over 30,000 new jobs by 2015. The zones will benefit from over £150 million in tax breaks over 4 years, new superfast broadband, lower levels of planning control and the potential to use enhanced capital allowances.""

Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles, said:

> ""Too many of our towns and cities have been left behind, but the answer has never been to impose ineffective sprawling regional structures. It is local business and commerce that drive the private sector growth, jobs and wealth this country needs. This Government's job is to foster local enterprise and create the conditions for businesses to thrive in. That is why low tax, low regulation Enterprise Zones are being planted across the country and will give businesses all the incentives they need to grow their local economy and create thousands of new local jobs.""

Business Secretary, Vince Cable, said:

> ""Enterprise Zones are creating an environment for businesses to grow in places with the most potential. Those the government is announcing today, on top of those already approved, show the range of ambitious plans in place across the country.
> 
> ""Local Enterprise Partnerships have worked closely with businesses in their communities to put forward a range of high-quality proposals. The successful bids they will now take forward are going to help inject new growth into their economies.
> 
> ""Across England, these Zones will generate new jobs, investment in areas that can benefit, and develop high-tech products that will secure long-term sustainable prosperity.""

### Notes for editors

1. To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy, the Government announced at Budget 2011 that it would establish 21 new Enterprise Zones with superfast broadband, lower taxes, and low levels of regulation and planning controls.

2. The first round of Enterprise Zones was announced in the Budget 2011 and will be based within the following eleven local enterprise partnerships: Birmingham and Solihull, Sheffield City Region, Leeds City Region, Liverpool City Region, London, Greater Manchester, West of England, the Black Country, Derby and Nottingham, Tees Valley and the North East. More details can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1872164](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/1872164).

3. A further announcement on the exact location of Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds and Sheffield Enterprise Zones was made in late July. Further details can be found at: [www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_90_11.htm](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_90_11.htm) (external link).

4. The Government also announced the allocation of funding for the UK's broadband network yesterday, with English counties due to receive £294.8 million and Scotland £68.8 million. Further details can be found at: [www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/8389.aspx](http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/8389.aspx) (external link).

5. Enterprise Zones will benefit from:

  * A 100 per cent business rate discount worth up to £275,000 over a five year period, for businesses that move into an Enterprise Zone during the course of this Parliament;
  * All business rates growth within the zone for a period of at least 25 years will be retained and shared by the local authorities in the LEP area to support their economic priorities;
  * Government and local authority help to develop radically simplified planning approaches in the zone; and
  * Government support to ensure superfast broadband is rolled out in the zone. This will be achieved through guaranteeing the most supportive environment and, if necessary, public funding.

6. The Government will make enhanced capital allowances for investment in plant and machinery available in designated areas within a limited number of Enterprise Zones. This is only available where the Government and Local Enterprise Partnership agree that it is better for the local economy to focus on a smaller number of companies making significant capital intensive investments. The vast majority of Enterprise Zones will retain a focus on attracting greater volumes of companies through business rate discounts.

7. The Government is also keen to support the introduction of Enterprise Zones in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, if the Devolved Administrations wish to establish them. Government will hold further discussions with the Devolved Administrations about how best to do this.

8. Thirty local enterprise partnerships submitted bids for one of the limited Enterprise Zones places available in this second wave competition.

9. However, Ministers are urging areas that missed out today to remain ambitious and pursue their innovative ideas to foster local enterprise. Every area can still put together a deal for local growth. Councils have the power to implement a simplified planning regime for themselves and UK Trade and Investment is ready to work with all areas to attract foreign direct investment.

10. In addition they will be able to harness Tax Incremental Financing powers, to finance new infrastructure by borrowing against increases in business rates, locally funded business rate discounts and the local retention of business rates when they become law. This will give councils a direct stake in the local economy and new ways to support business growth.

",17-Aug-11,supporting-economic-growth-through-local-enterprise-partnerships-and-enterprise-zones,,,,greg-clark,,,,
http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1631939,The internet age will help end the town hall 'non-job',"Council job adverts should be syndicated across the internet, to save money, increase transparency and help reduce pointless posts, Eric Pickles, Local Government Secretary will say today.

At a speech to the Local Government Association conference in Bournemouth, he will call time on so-called 'non-jobs' and urge greater vigilance over how every taxpayer pound is spent.

It can cost £5,000 to £10,000 to place an advert in some national newspapers. Often classifieds are filled with job titles many people would struggle to understand and many more that appear superfluous to the key services local people look to their council to provide.

The new Government will be working with local government not only to put online information on spending, tenders and contracts over £500, but also to publish job vacancies online, in an open and standardised format, for anyone to use, re-publish and 'mash up' without charge. There will be no public sector monopoly - the jobs data can be used by anyone, from commercial recruitment, newspapers to pressure groups.

This will not end advertising in the media; local newspapers in particular will remain an important source to advertise jobs to those who may be 'digital excluded' and not have access to the internet. But over time, putting job adverts online will drive down advertising costs, make it easier to compare pay ranges within and across councils, and show local people where their council tax goes.

Eric Pickles will say to the Conference:

> ""Putting jobs online not only shows local people where their money is going. It will mean they can question whether those jobs are really needed at all.
> 
> ""What does an audience development officer do? Is a 'cheerleading development officer' what taxpayers want? How many transformation officers and business development directors does one council need?
> 
> ""One council was even advertising for someone to spin for their bins last week. I wonder whether their residents actually want a 'communications waste strategy officer.' Or whether they'd prefer a few more bin men.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2095306,The majority looking to freeze or reduce Council Tax,"Residents and hard pressed families will be relieved that the majority of councils are intending to make their cost of living a little easier by taking up the Government's council tax freeze offer, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

Over 300 councils in England are planning to freeze or reduce council tax next year according to public information compiled by the Department. Around 80 per cent of authorities have so far signaled an intention to freeze or reduce next year.

Three authorities previously thought to be increasing council tax have now signaled they will freeze: Brighton and Hove, Taunton Deane and Scarborough. Eight authorities have indicated they will cut council tax in cash terms. They are Hammersmith and Fulham, South Oxfordshire, Stratford-on-Avon, Tendring, Windsor and Maidenhead, South Holland, Brentwood and the Greater London Authority.

Council tax bills more than doubled between 1997and 2011. Last year's freeze saved households up to an estimated £72 on a Band D bill, and this year's freeze could potentially do the same.

This is the second year the Government has offered to freeze council tax for local residents, families and pensioners. It builds on the offer taken up by all councils last year boosting what they could get over four years to £3.3 billion if they hold council tax for a second year.

The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles said:

> ""With two weeks to go, we now know that the majority of councils, over 300 in fact, want to freeze bills for their residents in tough times. Not everyone has set out their budget plans yet so I expect to see those taking up the Government's freeze deal to climb further.
> 
> ""A minority of out of touch authorities that seem unwilling to accept our offer should face up to the fact that it is unnecessary and it will hit hardworking households in the pocket. Residents will spot that many neighbouring councils are able to offer to freeze.
> 
> ""After 1997 bills were allowed to double to around £120 a month - freezing council tax again is a very tangible way to show the public they'll get the help they need.""

### Notes to editors

1. The list of councils that have signaled their intention to take part in the Government's 2012-13 council tax freeze initiative as of 24 February 2012 is available here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2095285.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2095285.pdf) (PDF, 63kb).

2. Council tax bills hit £1,439 on Band D in England in 2010-11. This year, 2011-12, the average Band D bill set by local authorities remained at £1,439. In London it was £1,308; in metropolitan areas it was £1,399; and in shire areas it was £1,484. Council tax was £688 in 1997-98. This means council tax has risen over one hundred per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. Since all other Bands are set as a percentage of Band D, homes in every band have seen their bills double.

4. The value of saving for taxpayers by area from two years of the council tax freeze scheme compared to a five per cent rise can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2028892.xls) (Excel, 63kb).

5. Local authorities who do not put up their council tax will receive a grant worth 2.5 per cent of their council tax income. The freeze means local taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £72. More details on how the council tax freeze scheme works: [www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2000149.pdf) (PDF, 32kb).

6. The Localism Act abolishes Whitehall capping in England and puts local referendums in its place. This gives the public the right to veto excessive council tax rises. Councils that set council tax increase above a ceiling approved by Parliament each year would automatically trigger a referendum of all registered local electors in their area. This year the proposed new 'local tax lock' allows people a vote to stop council tax going up in most cases if their local authority refuses to freeze bills and hike the tax by more than 3.5 per cent. Parliament endorsed the final vote threshold on 8 February 2012.

7. The Government's provisional funding settlement for English local authorities next financial year will mean councils have an average spending power of £2,186 per household at their disposal. £27.8 billion will be distributed in 2012-13 in a fair and sustainable way across all parts of the country - rural and urban, metropolitan and shire. It will give more weight to areas with the highest levels of assessed need. For example, the average spending power per household in Hackney will be £3,050 compared with £1,537 in Windsor and Maidenhead reflecting the fairness of the settlement. Overall the average spending power reduction for councils in 2012-13 is expected to be limited to just 3.3 per cent or £75 per household, less than last year's comparable figure of 4.5 per cent.

8. Average Band D council tax and percentage change between 1993-94 and 2011-12 are shown below:

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1700319,"The new, simple, easy-to-use form to organise street parties has arrived!","Organising a street party or summer fete has never been easier thanks to a new, simple, easy-to-use form.

![Image: A street party](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1700157.jpg)Instead of reams of forms, high costs and red tape getting in the way of organising small scale local events, if you and your neighbours want to hold a small street party or a small local fete - councils can ask street party organisers to complete one simple form.

Previously, some small community groups were asked to apply for up to five separate licences and found it tricky to get upfront advice on what to do. They also found out about hidden costs right at the last minute, causing delays or cancellations to community events.

The new approach follows a cross government meeting held by Communities and Local Government, with the Department for Transport, Department of Culture Media and Sport as well as local government and community groups such as the Big Lunch and Streets Alive.

The Secretary of State, Eric Pickles, was also keen to expel the myth that councils are required by law to advertise and charge extortionate fees for small road closures.

![Image: Folk dancers at a street party](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1700343.jpg)Mr Pickles, said:

> ""Fetes, street parties and fairs should be fun, and everyone's energy needs to go into the fun part - not trawling through endless reams of guidance and dusty rules.
> 
> ""I want to banish the myths around laws preventing people from putting on events.
> 
> ""So there is still time for you to get together with your neighbours this summer. Your council may be able to help you close a road for a proper street party. If not, you can hold something in a garden or even the park. It's your community, so celebrate it.""

### Summer fetes - a great British tradition

Seasonal fetes and street parties are a great British tradition. It gives people the opportunity to get to know their neighbours and meet members of their community by holding an event on their doorstep.

Events such as The Big Lunch had almost 1,000,000 attend. The appetite for street parties and fetes is likely to continue with events such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics in 2012. The new form will make organising a street party or fete much easier.

### Further Information

To access the form and for further information on organising a street party or fete please see the 'Your guide to organising a street party or fete' form via the link on the right hand side of this page.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1982019,The riots one month on: the good work must continue,"This week marks one month since the worst of the rioting hit the streets of some of our biggest cities. Since then, councils have been pulling out all the stops to get affected areas back to normal, local businesses back up and running, and those forced to move out of their homes back into safe and stable accommodation.

Within days of the riots taking place, the Government launched a multi million pound package of support to overcome the immediate recovery issues that communities and businesses were facing and to help them get back on their feet. The latest figures show that 30 local authorities are making use of the funds to support the small traders, businesses and families in their area that were directly affected by the riots.

The money has been used for a wide range of support measures - from helping small businesses with upfront costs like insurance excesses, building repairs, and carrying out safety checks, to reducing business rates and encouraging customers back into affected areas. It has also been used to meet the immediate costs of emergency accommodation for families who have been made homeless and offer council tax discounts or relief to those whose homes have been damaged but are still habitable.

Local authorities played a key role in the immediate recovery operation and continue to lead the way by administering the support schemes, which are delivering tangible results and making a real difference to communities:

  * [Croydon Council](http://www.croydon.gov.uk/advice/emergencies/civil-unrest/latest-information) (external link) has opened a temporary 'one stop shop' to provide people affected by the civil unrest with immediate advice and support on everything from insurance claims to housing and emergency benefits. A £100,000 'Family Support Fund' has also been made available to families directly affected to cover short-term costs and bring about a sense of normality - for example using the money to buy school uniforms for the new school year, or to meet higher rental costs of temporary accommodation.
  * [Manchester City Council](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/news/article/6047/council_announces_support_package_for_riot-hit_businesses) (external link) has reduced business rates to businesses in the city and made grants of up to £2,500 and loans available to those who took a direct hit from the riots. The city also launched the [I Love MCR campaign](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/100009/events_leisure_and_tourism/5228/i_love_mcr) (external link) to demonstrate pride in the city and encourage people back to shop, eat, drink and socialise in the city.
  * [Ealing Council](http://www.ealing.gov.uk/homepage/64/riot_recovery) (external link) has a £250,000 fund to help independent traders that suffered damage from vandals and looters, helping them pay for things like new glazing and building repairs. The council has also offered interest free repayable grants to the worst affected small traders, which are likely to have to remain closed for up to six months.
  * [Lambeth Council](http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/News/2011/220811LambethBusinessCommunitiesWorkingTogether.htm) (external link) has been holding 'drop in' surgeries for businesses to learn more about the recovery support available, how to apply for funds to tide them over while they get back on their feet again, and get help filling out compensation forms.

The support packages were part of concerted, cross-Government action to help rebuild communities, open up shops and buildings which were damaged, make sure people who lost their homes were re-housed, and to help councils get their areas back to normal as quickly as possible. The measures announced included:

  * a £10million Recovery Scheme which was put in place to help councils with the immediate costs of making their areas safe, clear and clean again, and to enable them to provide council tax discounts to affected residents.
  * a £20million High Street Support Scheme to support Small and Medium sized business affected by the disturbances by providing business rate hardship relief, rebuilding confidence and helping affected businesses get back up and running.
  * a £1million Homelessness Support Scheme which met the immediate costs of re-housing those made homeless by the disturbances with a maximum payment threshold of up to £5,000 per household, with discretion applied for exceptional costs.
  * a £20million London Enterprise Fund to kick-start economic growth and regeneration mainly in Tottenham and Croydon, to be administered by the Mayor of London alongside his £50million recovery fund.

The measures came on top of support for individual homeowners and businesses under the Riot (Damages) Act and local authorities under the Bellwin Scheme, and a £3million 'High Street Fund' set up with contributions from the Mayor, leading UK companies and local authorities to offer initial recovery grants to small businesses.

This week, the Secretary of State is meeting with the leaders of those local authorities affected by the riots to discuss how to restore commercial and community confidence in affected areas, and any difficulties they are facing in recovering from the disturbances or any barriers that need addressing.

And whilst areas are given time to recover and return to normality, they have pledged to continue to work closely with councils and provide support at a national level to ensure that every business forced to close, and every family forced to move, are helped back into their community as quickly as possible.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1833677,Top industry figures launch plans to free up self-builders,"Ministers have met with self build industry leaders to launch a powerful new group to advise them on how to cut the red tape and regulations that are stopping aspiring self-builders from realising their ambitions.

Since Grant Shapps called on the country's aspiring self-builders to make a housebuilding revolution their New Year's resolution last month, the National Self-Build Association has been working with his officials to set up the group whose task it will be to develop an action plan to tackle the key barriers to the growth of self-build housing - such as availability of land, finance and expert support for people new to the industry.

Today's meeting with Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell will see the first meeting of the working group to begin to work through these issues, and agreeing concrete steps to try and increase the number of self-builds up and down the country.

Self-builders are already Britain's largest housebuilder, and account for about one-fifth of Britain's new homes each year, but for far too long the aspirations of ordinary people to build their own home have been thwarted by barriers and red tape.

These obstacles have led to the UK having one of the lowest proportions of new homes built by self-builders in Europe. The Government has pledged to end self-building as the preserve of the privileged few, and enable aspiring self-builders to put building their own home at the top of their New Year's resolutions.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""Self-builders already make a big contribution to new homes built in this country each year - yet we still lag behind most of Europe. I want to turn around the fortunes of self-builders by cutting the red tape and bureaucracy they often face.
> 
> ""That's why I'm delighted that the National Association of Self-Builders has agreed to work with my officials to identify the barriers that aspiring self-builders often face, and to let us in Whitehall know what we can do to make it easier to help people achieve their dream of building their own home.
> 
> ""I have been encouraged by the progress they are making in developing an all-important action plan, which will sit alongside the efforts we are already making through the Localism Bill to put power in the hands of communities up and down the country, enabling them to give the green light to new developments through the Community Right to Build, and simplifying the overly-bureaucratic planning system.""

Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Self build housing forms an important part of the Government's strong commitment to increasing supply of affordable and sustainable homes. Self build initiatives are both good for communities and the environment. They can help to regenerate abandoned urban sites, and ensure that countryside communities remain vibrant places to live and not museums.
> 
> ""And because of the value for money that can be achieved, self-builders can have more choice to include energy saving green products, such as solar panels or super-insulation. And by the very nature of being a self builder there are greater chances to look at new innovations which can save money in the long term.""

Ted Stevens, chair of the National Self-Build Association (NaSBA), said:

> ""Most people think building your own home is very expensive. They see many of the fancy homes featured on Grand Designs and think that's what it's all about. In fact the vast majority of self build homes cost less than £150,000 to construct - and for that you can comfortably build an attractive, energy-efficient, custom-designed three or four bedroom home.
> 
> ""We believe the actions taken by this new self build group could potentially make it much easier for people to build thousands of new, affordable homes each year. Our aim is to ensure that the new industry/government group will not be a 'talking shop'; instead we want to see it work as more of a 'launching platform' by removing the barriers over land availability and finance that are currently holding back the industry's development.""

The working group consists of:

  * Ted Stevens - chair of the National Self-build Association (NaSBA)
  * Jackson Moulding - Director of Ecomotive
  * Raymond Connor - CEO of Buildstore
  * Tom Willcocks - Policy and Strategy Manager at the Homes and Communities Agency
  * Stephen Hill - RICS member director of C20 futureplanners
  * Nic Bliss - chair of the Confederation of Co-operative Housing
  * Roger Humber - Strategic Policy Adviser to the House Builders Association
  * Paul Broadhead - Head of mortgage policy at the Building Societies Association
  * John Gillespie - National Development Director of the Community Self-build Agency
  * Barry Sutcliffe - Self-builder.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1929320,Top-down targets have failed to deliver more homes,"The abolition of Regional Strategies and reforms of the planning system are central to boosting homes and jobs Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today.

The Secretary of State was responding to the Communities and Local Government's Select Committee inquiry into the abolition of Regional Strategies.

The Government's growth review has made clear our commitment to supporting sustainable growth through reforms of the planning system. The removal of top-down targets and a strengthened duty to co-operate, along with incentives will help drive housebuilding. Housebuilding is now rising and is up 22 per cent over the past year to March 2011.

Mr Pickles said:

> ""I welcome this report and will take the findings into account as policy develops. But the evidence is clear, top down targets simply haven't worked. Under the previous Government we saw the lowest peacetime house building rates since 1924 and resentment from communities.
> 
> ""Bringing about more homes and jobs is a top priority for the Government and we are determined to address this problem. We must increase the number of homes being built and have introduced a number of incentives to kick-start building. House building has started to rise again and recently we paid the first cash payments under the New Homes Bonus.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1878443,Tough new publicity rules for councils take effect today,"Measures by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to preserve a strong, vibrant, independent local press are now in force as new rules governing taxpayer funded town hall freesheets and council publicity have been agreed by Parliament.

In recent years there has been a marked growth in the frequency and scope of council publicity techniques funded by taxpayers' money, whilst local papers have struggled in a saturated news environment. Mr Pickles has raised strong concerns over this use of taxpayers' money. He believes councils should focus their resources on protecting front line services.

A new publicity code strengthening the rules for English councils on what can be considered appropriate spending of taxpayers' money is now in force after approval by Parliament. Mr Pickles said that the new rules would strengthen the local democratic process.

The new rules bring to an end politically contentious advertising campaigns, prevent municipal newspapers being published more than four times a year, and halt the hiring of lobbyists by councils.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""We said that we would bring an end to improper council publicity and now a new code of practice is in force. These new rules make it crystal clear that taxpayers' money should be for protecting front line services not printing Pravdas or paying for professional lobbyists to put the squeeze on Whitehall. Publicity straying into propaganda clearly crosses the line of appropriate public funding whilst film reviews and TV listings sit far beyond the realm of council news.""

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""As councils strive to cut back waste their public spending should be under more scrutiny than ever and a vibrant and independent local press has a vital role to play holding those local leaders to account. But the boom in funded council papers in recent years has left many local newspapers out in the cold. Today we're giving local papers a fresh start.""

Seven fundamental principles set out in the revised Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity will make sure that council publicity is lawful, objective, appropriate, even handed and cost effective, with regard to equality and diversity and periods of heightened sensitivity. ""Appropriate use of publicity"" is defined below:

  * advertising should be balanced, factually accurate and not likely to be perceived by the public as a political statement or a commentary on contentious areas of public policy

  * councils should not publish newspapers in direct competition to local press. They should not appear more than quarterly and should only include material directly related to local services. Parishes will be able to issue monthly

  * councils should not spend taxpayers' money to lobby government through private sector lobbyists or through publicity stalls at party conferences

### Notes to editors

1. Full details of the new Government Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycode2011](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/publicitycode2011).

2. The Code was originally introduced in 1988 and amended by the last Government in 2001. The revised Code applies to England only. The purpose of the Code was to ensure proper use of public funds for publicity. Effective, efficient publicity that successfully tells the public what they need to know about the services and activities of their council is legitimate; the public need information to hold their authority to account. The Publicity Code is statutory guidance to which local authorities have to have regard in the production of their publicity.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1837218,Town hall transparency: Pickles' code to decipher middle management maze,"A second radical phase in the Government's drive for greater openness will shine the torch of transparency on Town Hall middle management across the country, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles will announce today.

Over ninety five per cent of councils have published their spending data over £500 online. Latest reports to the Department show 346 councils in England are now online. Mr Pickles praised them for leading the transformation to transparent Town Halls. Eight are still to reveal data to the public.

A draft Code of Recommended Practice for Local Government Data Transparency is being published today for consultation, offering all councils, including those yet to comply, a clear outline of what will be expected of them.

In the new push for transparency, councils will be now be asked to publish an organisational chart including the names and responsibilities of staff paid over £58,200 - equivalent to the lowest Senior Civil Service pay band. Ministers believe this will give the public the full picture of a council's management composition.

The document also lays out core principles of data transparency, which Ministers believe all local authorities should embrace as part of the new era of accountability, including the expectation that they should publish information on salaries, voluntary funding, licensing, contracts or tenders, expenses and performance.

Councils will also be expected to respond to public demand for more information, where residents decide what data is important, so they can see exactly where their tax pounds go and how their council is performing.

The code also recommends a public inventory should be registered at [www.data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/home) (external link), the Government's central information hub, in an accessible format so that it is easy to locate or reuse.

Secretary of State Eric Pickles said:

> ""The taxpayer has a right to look under the bonnet of their Town Hall and see what decisions are being made on their behalf and where their money is being spent.
> 
> ""I asked all councils to put online everything they spend over £500 and I commend the majority have had the good sense to lead this transformation in transparency. Today I'm publishing a new code that will help decipher the Town Hall maze of middle management, bringing more public information to light. This will also give the few remaining refuseniks a clear game plan to follow.
> 
> ""Transparency must be the underlying principal behind everything councils do. Every aspect of council business should be open to public scrutiny including senior pay, councillor expenses, local services and voluntary sector funding. This can help save money in tough times, protecting the frontline by cutting waste and unnecessary costs.""

### Notes to editor

1. Consultation on the draft Code of Recommended Practice for Local Government data transparency will close on 14 March 2011. It applies to England only. Local Authorities will be expected to comply with data protection law and to take a risk management approach to payment fraud. Suitable approaches are included. The Code is available for comment at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataconsult](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/codepracticeladataconsult).

2. The Code proposes the minimum datasets that should be released, openly and for reuse, by local authorities are:

  * expenditure over £500, (including costs, supplier and transaction information)

  * grants and payments under contract to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector

  * names, budgets and responsibilities of staff paid over £58,200 - equivalent to the lowest Senior Civil Service pay band

  * an organisational chart

  * councillor allowances and expenses

  * copies of contracts and tenders to businesses and to the voluntary community and social enterprise sector

  * policies, performance, audits and key indicators on the authorities' fiscal and financial position

  * data of democratic running of the local authority including the constitution, election results, committee minutes, decision - making processes and records of decisions.

3. The Code is published under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, which gives the Secretary of State the power to issue a code about the publication of information by local authorities about the discharge of their function. The Act also empowers the Secretary of State to introduce subsequent regulation should that be necessary to enforce greater transparency.

4. An A - Z of all the council that have told DCLG they have put their spending data online can be found at: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/transparency/localgovernmentexpenditure/](http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1837218).

5. Experian research suggests councils could be overpaying by as much as £150m a year in duplicated bills. Publishing spend data online can help reduce this trend: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/corporate/1738897](http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1738897).

6. The Department for Communities is leading the way across Whitehall and Local Government by publishing all its expenditure over £500 online too.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1728523,Transparency trailblazer Pickles publishes more department spending data,"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is today continuing to open up the Government accounts to the public and set out new austerity procedures for his department.

In the first of regularly planned updates Communities and Local Government has published spend over £500 online for the first quarter of 2010-11 (April-June) - allowing the public to scrutinise how £125m of taxpayer money was spent.

Every central government department will be required to publish data above £25,000 from November to shine a spotlight on spend and root out waste and duplication. Having set the bar at £500 for town halls, Mr Pickles believes his own department should play by those same rules and is acting ahead of deadline to start regularly publishing its figures.

### Future thrift as Department gets house in order

The Secretary of State also revealed new austerity actions, in the form of a series of simple measures, his department is taking to cut waste and bring spending down. These cost saving measures are part of identified £780m savings across the CLG budget for 2010-11.

The money saving ideas, submitted by staff, include:

  * New compliance rules to ensure staff always use public transport and standard class on trains;
  * An end to refreshments for internal staff meetings and any meeting under four hours;
  * Cancellation of non-essential newspaper and magazine subscriptions;
  * A reduction in staff Blackberries and mobile phones;
  * Cutting down on first-class post;
  * Switching off a number of lifts during quiet periods;
  * Plans to limit the number of printers and limiting photocopiers to one per floor;
  * Plans to close CLG's HQ overnight and at weekends; and
  * Turning heating down to save energy and expense.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""Being open about how taxpayers' money is spent will push central and local government into rooting out waste and duplication. That's why we're throwing open the shutters and bringing the full glare of the public's eye onto spending.
> 
> ""This new transparent era means a new way of thinking for councils but I'm showing them it's possible by publishing more of my department's spending online. I can't expect councils to cut waste if we don't get our own house in order. Today I'm implementing the best austerity ideas from CLG staff from cutting catering, to only using second-class stamps to more double-sided printing. These show there are thriftier and smarter ways to use taxpayers' money in the future.
> 
> ""The whole country has to play its part as we tackle a mountain of inherited debt. By publishing this data we invite an army of armchair auditors to scrutinise where their money goes and make sure it is spent on the right priorities. I want town halls to do the same so the public have local spending at their fingertips.""

Departmental spending has also been published today for 2008/09 for over £500 and for spending over £1000 for Arms Length Bodies (ALBs). Last month spending details over £500 for 2009/10 were published.

### Books opened to reveal more Whitehall local spending data

In addition central government departments and ALBs are expanding the data made available relating to expenditure in local areas through a free to use website.

The public can now find datasets on local spending by searching for local-spend-data on government's central data portal data.gov.uk. The data now available for 2007/08 and 2008/09 includes expenditure on benefits, breakdown of revenue expenditure by Primary Care Trusts, Strategic Health Authorities and NHS trusts and grants by Home Office to Drug Action Teams with more datasets available over the coming weeks.

All of the local spending data has been tagged with local-spend-data. The Cabinet Office have announced that anyone can make suggestions about which datasets they wish to see be made public by going to [www.data.gov.uk/data](http://data.gov.uk/home) (external link) and clicking on the 'request new data' button.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2118082,Troubled families: top 10 areas are on board as government is ready to go,"The 10 local authorities with the largest number of troubled families have agreed to sign up to the Government's ambitious scheme to turn around the lives of 120,000 problem households by 2015. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today unveiled a unique payment by results scheme that will deliver up to £4,000 per family to local authorities which get children back into school, reduce youth crime and anti-social behaviour, put adults on a path back to work and bring down the £9 billion annual costs caused by dealing with them.

Just three months after the programme's funding was launched by the Prime Minister, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the 10 top-tier authorities with the largest amount of troubled families, which together form one fifth of those being targeted, are already on board, along with support from the voluntary sector. Many more are enthusiastic and expected to join the scheme in the coming months, with all 152 invited to a reception hosted by David Cameron in Downing Street tonight to mark the start of the scheme, alongside frontline workers and representatives of the voluntary sector.

The £448 million three-year programme is taking money from across Whitehall to help local authorities get to grips with whole families and deal with their problems at root cause through proven techniques, rather than a multitude of agencies working with single people within a family, often just reacting to their problems. However councils will only be given a full payment for their work when they have delivered results and reduced the £75,000 costs to the taxpayer that these families cause through demands on services each year.

Mr Pickles also announced that following a plea from councils the Department for Communities and Local Government has reached a groundbreaking agreement with the Department for Work and Pensions which, while strictly protecting confidentiality, allows jobcentres to share data with local councils in order to identify their troubled families. This means councils will be able to pull together the names and addresses of the families in their area whose children are missing school, involved in crime and anti-social behaviour and also on benefits, so they can start work with them to turn their lives around, tackling all of their problems.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

> ""I'm committed to transforming the lives of families stuck in a cycle of unemployment, alcohol abuse and anti-social behaviour, where children are truants from school - troubled families who cause such negativity within their communities and who drain resources from our councils. I'm heartened that so many local authorities are alert to this challenge and are ready to take forwards our plans to bring about real change. I know that as this programme rolls out and increasingly gains momentum we can help people, and our communities and our society will become stronger as a result.""

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

> ""The Prime Minister charged my department in December with delivering an ambitious but achievable programme to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families by 2015. We have met with 147 Councils over the last three months to help shape our payment by results scheme which will incentivise local authorities to deal with the truancy, crime and the worklessness that can be passed down from generation to generation and which puts a £9 billion per year drain on the public purse. It is great news that the top 10 councils with the most troubled families have already agreed to begin work with us as between them they cover a fifth of the families we have pledged to change. We cannot afford to wait any longer to start doing this work and I am delighted that it will now begin.""

Head of Troubled Families Policy Louise Casey said:

> ""Both local and central government recognise this programme could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to shift the sense of hopelessness that is often felt about these families - that nothing can be done to really help change them, to get them into school, work or to stop their crime and anti-social behaviour. If we work together and get this right, it's also a chance to make a cultural shift in the way services are delivered by professionals - an approach that is about a lead worker gripping a family as a whole and getting to the root causes of their problems. But most importantly this programme is a way to give the kids in these households a chance not to repeat the pattern of unemployment, lawlessness and failure of their parents and often grandparents.""

Chief Executive of Action For Children, Dame Claire Tickell said:

> ""Today's announcement reinforces the welcome commitment to support the most vulnerable families who face a whole host of challenges in their lives. From our own experience of intensively working with these very families in Family Intervention Projects within local communities, we know the solutions that help to turn lives around and deliver real results. Key to this is partnership working between local authorities and the voluntary sector, to create tailored solutions that tackle the root causes of issues within families and help them to develop the skills and confidence they need to make positive changes to their own lives.""

### Notes to editors

1. This News Release covers England.

2. _The Framework Document for Troubled Families Funding_ can be found here: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/troubledfamiliesframework](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/troubledfamiliesframework).

3. The data-sharing agreement with the Department for Work and Pensions changes regulations of the Welfare Reform Act 2012. It contains strict protections against abuse that will ensure this is only used appropriately and for this purpose only.

4. The top 10 local authorities in terms of their number of troubled families are:

  
  


5. The payment by results criteria are:

  * more than 85 per cent attendance in schools and fewer than three exclusions from school
  * a 60 per cent reduction in anti-social behaviour across the whole family
  * and a 33 per cent reduction in youth offending  
= £3,900

Plus

  * progress towards work such as enrolment in the Work Programme or the European Social Fund provision for troubled families  
= £100

Or

  * One adult in the family moving off benefits and into work.  
=£4,000

Local authorities are expected to make up the remaining 60 per cent of the average £10,000 cost of a successful family intervention.

6. The funding provided under the Troubled Families payment by results arrangements will be available for five out of six troubled families in each upper-tier local authority. This is to avoid paying twice for the same outcomes. Government funding has already been provided to support these remaining families. For example, the Department for Work and Pension's £200 million+ European Social Fund provision, the Work Programme and existing government-funded Multi-Systemic Therapy pilots.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1936433,Twenty nine bids received for a second wave enterprise zone,"Twenty nine proposals will compete for the final ten enterprise zone spots, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced today, following the deadline for second wave applications.

Local enterprise partnerships across the country have put forward locations for enterprise zones that they believe have the potential to deliver growth for the whole area. The ten zones selected will benefit from simplified planning rules, super-fast broadband and tax breaks for businesses to promote growth.

Ministers believe Enterprise Zones can help make the country the best place in Europe to start and grow a business. But there is a strict selection criteria in order to ensure that designated Zones act as genuine catalysts for growth and encourage greater and faster business and job creation.

Applications will be assessed against three key criteria of success and only the best will get a zone:

  * Ability to deliver growth and jobs: a clear, evidence based strategy to deliver sustainable economic growth by removing barriers to businesses.
  * Value for money: the proposal should deliver as much as possible for the investment being made
  * Implementation: plans for delivery are robust and support the growth focus of the bid.

When selecting the winners for the second wave, the Government will look at carefully at the choice of site, which should have little or no existing businesses there already. Enterprise Zones should not be merely displacing economic activity from one part of the local enterprise partnership to another and the Government will also look at the targeting of sectors.

A simplified planning regime will also be a critical part of any successful Enterprise Zone proposal.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""The huge interest in and enthusiasm for second wave enterprise zones across the country is proof that local enterprise partnerships have the ideas and enthusiasm to drive forward their local economies. I'm impressed by the number of partnerships that have put forward innovative and ambitious plans for an Enterprise Zone in their area.
> 
> ""This will be a tough competition and only the best will get the go ahead. We'll be looking for the zones that have genuine potential to create the new business and jobs their area needs so we can make this country the best place in Europe to start and grow a business.""

Business Secretary Vince Cable said:

> ""Supporting economic growth is this government's central task. Enterprise Zones will create the environment for businesses to thrive and stimulate growth in the places that have the most potential.
> 
> ""The 21 areas we are creating across England will give businesses simpler planning rules, access to super-fast broadband and more generous treatment in respect to business rates and capital allowances.
> 
> ""On top of that, the benefits of growth within Enterprise Zones will be kept within their communities, helping to drive the creation of more new jobs and successful enterprises.""

Ministers have also announced a positive response to the Regional Growth Fund second round, which also closed to bids on Friday.

The Government is creating a new generation of 21 enterprise zones that will stimulate business and jobs, promote growth and bring benefits to the wider economic area. The first 11 partnerships to get Enterprise Zones were announced in the Budget 2011. The competition for 10 further enterprise zones was announced in May 2011 and the successful applicants we be announced this summer.

There are now 35 local enterprise partnerships across the country covering over 96 per cent of England's population, 1.9 million businesses and 22 million employees. These partnerships bring local business and council leaders together to determine the economic priorities for their areas.

### Notes to editors:

1. The first eleven vanguard Enterprise Zones were announced in the Budget 2011 and will be based within the following eleven local enterprise partnerships: Birmingham and Solihull, Sheffield City Region, Leeds City Region, Liverpool City Region, London, Greater Manchester, West of England, the Black Country, Derby and Nottingham, Tees Valley and the North East.

2. All Enterprise Zones will benefit from:

  * a business rate discount worth up to £275,000 per eligible business over a five year period

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2120585,Up to £1 million to help communities shape the future of their high streets,"Today Planning Minister Greg Clark revealed that £1 million will be made available to support the creation of high street neighbourhood plans that will help revitalise this crucial part of the local economy.

The announcement is part of the Government's 'Portas-plus' response to the Mary Portas' High Street Review, which goes above and beyond her recommendations and includes a raft of new incentives, funding schemes and bureaucracy-busting measures, all in a bid to rejuvenate the country's rundown high streets.

This financial support for neighbourhood planning will help local people, businesses and councils come together to develop and agree a neighbourhood high street plan that makes sure locally led sustainable development puts the town centre first with plans for the vitalising and growing their high street economy.

Planning Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""For too long local people have been shut out of the planning process with no real voice to affect decisions about the places where they live.
> 
> ""High streets are at the heart of their communities and new neighbourhood plans hand power back to communities so they can help shape the future development of this crucial part of their local economy.
> 
> ""This £1 million fund will support local people, businesses and councils coming together to provide a really positive contribution to the future vitality and viability of our high streets.""

Neighbourhood planning is part of a series of measures announced in the Localism Act, shifting power away form Whitehall into the hands of local people. Over 200 neighbourhood planning front-runner projects are already trialling the new powers before they are fully rolled out next week. Several of these areas are developing plans to reinvigorate their high streets including Wolverton in Milton Keynes, Sudbury Town, Thame in South Oxfordshire, and Leytonstone.

Further information on how communities and local authorities developing high street neighbourhood plans under the Localism Act can access the £1milllion will be published shortly.

The new National Planning Policy Framework also responds to the Portas recommendation by underlining the importance of town centres and allowing councils to provide the parking facilities in town centres that will help them compete with out-of-town shopping centres and supermarkets.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2064121,Up to 2 years behind bars proposed for tenancy cheats,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today made proposals to help ensure tenancy cheats who deny social homes to families in need will face justice.

The Minister set out proposals to criminalise the abuse of social homes - such as unlawful subletting and key-selling - with a possible two year jail sentence. He said the plans could free up thousands of homes for housing waiting lists.

Tenancy cheats can earn thousands of pounds a year renting their social homes out to private tenants - but if caught, may currently face no greater penalty than losing their tenancy.

Mr Shapps wants to see much greater legal consequences for these cheats - and so is consulting on proposals that would introduce specific criminal offences for tenancy fraud, such as those which already exist for social security fraud. 

Some estimates suggest that between 50,000 and 160,000 social homes are currently being unlawfully occupied across the country.

The Minister said the plans would also strengthen councils' legal rights as landlords to help them detect and prosecute tenancy fraud more effectively and return lost revenue back to local coffers.

Proposals include:

  * **a new criminal offence** with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment and a fine of up to £50,000 if the case goes to the Crown court
  * proceeds of tenancy fraud to be **reimbursed to the social landlord** in whose stock the fraud was committed rather than being confiscated by the State
  * more **powers for local authorities to investigate** social tenancy fraud through better access to data from banks and utility companies. While councils can currently request data, organisations can refuse to provide it. The proposed changes would oblige them to comply.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Tenancy cheats are taking advantage of a vital support system for some of the most vulnerable people in our society and getting away with a slap on the wrist while our waiting lists continue to grow. It's time for these swindlers to pay the price. 
> 
> ""It would cost us billions of pounds to replace the huge number of unlawfully occupied social homes across the country. Meanwhile tenancy cheats can earn thousands of pounds letting out their property, which was given to them in good faith and which could instead be offering a stable home to a family in need.
> 
> ""The proposals I've announced today would not only deliver justice to these fraudsters, but will also act as a deterrent to those who think they can earn a fast buck from this precious resource. I want everyone to know that our country's social homes are going to those in genuine need, not providing a 'nice little earner' to someone who could afford to live elsewhere.""

The Partnership will investigate how local communities, planners and decision-makers can be supported in designing and developing new green infrastructure, make the case for new projects and look at how they can be improved to meet communities' needs.

Launching the Partnership is a Government commitment in the Natural Environment White Paper, published earlier in the year. The Partnership aims to work strategically at national level to promote the development and enhancement of green infrastructure.

Bob Neill, Minister Communities and Local Government said:

> ""Sustainable development must go hand in hand with protecting and making the best use of our valuable green spaces and rural corridors. The Green Infrastructure Partnership will be a key player in helping to develop the full potential of England's green infrastructure and demonstrating its social, economic and environmental benefits.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1611118,Victory for common sense on flags during the World Cup,"Councils across England are being encouraged to support communities who want to fly flags and show their support for teams competing in the World Cup.

![Grant Shapps displaying the England flag - Photo courtesy of the Welwyn Hatfield Times (Picture of Grant Shapps courtesy of the Welwyn Hatfield Times.)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1612010.jpg)

Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has written to councils urging them not to be 'spoilsports' and to take a common sense approach to flag flying during the tournament.""I'll be playing my part and displaying the flag proudly in my office in Whitehall.""

Mr Shapps wants to make clear that people who want to show their support should be able to, as long as they do not break the strict health and safety guidelines that councils rightly use. This includes taxi drivers, bin men and citizens who want to support their national team.

Grant Shapps said:

> ""The World Cup is an opportunity for councils to do their bit in helping reclaim the English flag as a proud symbol of our nation's identity. I hope that local authorities will take a common sense approach in order to avoid accusations of being over-zealous or spoilsports, so that communities can unite around flying the flag in support of their national team.

England flags are now flying at CLG, Eland House, London.![Image: England flags are now flying at CLG, Eland House, London.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/19857181)

> ""I'll be playing my part and displaying the flag proudly in my office in Whitehall. I want everyone around the country to feel free to do the same.""

The minister's call for common sense follows on from a number of cases where councils have asked for flags to be taken down on health and safety grounds.

Councils across the country reacted positively to the minister's letter:

> ""We have made arrangements to fly the St George's flag from the Eastbourne Town Hall mast for the duration of the World Cup."" - Eastbourne Borough Council
> 
> ""Telford and Wrekin Council is proud to fly the Cross of St George on a daily basis at our Civic Offices, alongside the Union Flag. For the duration of the World Cup it will take centre place to celebrate England's participation."" - Telford and Wrekin Council
> 
> ""We think that the Government's point about using this as an opportunity to help local residents from all backgrounds to come together in support of the England team at the World Cup is something we should certainly be supporting. Therefore we'll be following the Prime Minister's lead and flying the Cross of St. George at Leamington Spa Town Hall from Friday morning until the end of the tournament, when we hope we'll be welcoming Fabio and the team back as world champions."" - Warwick District Council.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1759036,Voluntary sector at the heart of public service reform,"Ministers have pledged swift action to open up new opportunities for the voluntary sector to help deliver public services as part of the Big Society.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark joined Paymaster General Francis Maude and Civil Society Minister Nick Hurd for a No11 Downing Street summit with voluntary sector leaders. They discussed plans for a Green Paper to address how to create a level playing field for charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises to bid for public service contracts.

Mr Clark added that the upcoming Localism Bill will devolve power from the centre, empowering people and organisations to challenge the way local services are being delivered and to offer a better, more cost effective alternative.

Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark said:

> ""The Government is united in its drive to open up public services so the best providers get the job. I am making sure that more power goes to the local level where decisions about what is needed are best made. I want local voluntary groups to have the right to deliver more services locally so that the sector are not confined to a walled-off part of councils' budgets.""

The Ministers also pledged continued investment in the training of public service commissioners and reiterated that social enterprises are eligible to apply for funding from the £1.4 billion regional growth fund.

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, said:

> ""In the past, huge amounts of money have gone in to public services and been swallowed up by bureaucracy before it reached the frontline. A Big Society approach will drive improvements by giving power to people working on the ground who know how to do things better.
> 
> ""I want to see a whole mix of providers. New models like public sector staff forming co-ops to run their services and civil society organisations forming new alliances with government and the private sector can drive this change. They will break down the old fashioned public service hierarchies and replace them with vibrant, efficient services that give people the support they need.""

Civil Society Minister Nick Hurd said:

> ""The commissioning Green Paper will kick-start a radical shift in public service contracting so only the most innovative approaches to win through. We know that there are too many barriers for civil society organisations that want to deliver public services and we are determined to sort them out. I'm very pleased that we can continue training public services commissioners in working with civil society, better understanding in this area will be critical to our success. It is also a great recognition of the value of social enterprises that they will be able to access the £1.4billion regional growth fund.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1846840,Voluntary sector funding announced to help tackle rough sleeping,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has today welcomed publication of the first set of rough sleeping figures since he overhauled the way counts are conducted.

The new figures bring the national total of rough sleepers to 1,768 on any given night - considerably higher than the 440 counted under the previous system.

In a change to the previous system, all councils now provide a robust estimate or a count of those sleeping rough in their area - in order to give a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area of the country.

And to support the work of the voluntary sector in tackling rough sleeping, the Government has announced an £18.5m package of funding for the main national homelessness charities, and extra powers for the Mayor of London to run pan-London rough sleeping services.

At the Spending Review, the Coalition Government announced a £400m investment to tackle homelessness. Whilst the majority of this funding is directed through councils to allow them to decide their priorities locally, ministers decided that there remained a compelling case for a 'Homelessness Grant' to be given directly to the voluntary sector.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""For too long a supposedly national figure of rough sleepers hasn't reflected the reality on our streets. Councils and local charities know their areas best and that's why I am putting them centre stage in assessing the true scale of the problem they face locally. By having these more accurate numbers and a better national picture of the problem - we can start to help the homeless much more effectively.
> 
> ""So whilst on the surface the new figures show a large jump in those sleeping on the streets, they actually reflect a more accurate way of evaluating the extent of rough sleeping. We had a situation before where large numbers of those spending the night on the street were simply being ignored, with cities like Manchester not counting in 2010 and Coventry not counting on a number of occasions.
> 
> ""And I have made clear that while it is vital we tackle the record Budget deficit we inherited, we must also ensure that the most vulnerable people in society are protected. This funding will strengthen the already vital role that charities play in tackling rough sleeping and enable them to provide more extensive services than would otherwise be possible"".

The Minister has also asked councils to replace Government officials on the count with representatives from Homeless Link, the national charity for all homelessness agencies. This ensures that those working directly to help people off the streets can best offer their expertise and advice, whilst providing a more consistent approach to counting rough sleepers.

And to tackle the wider issues affecting rough sleepers, Mr Shapps has brought together ministers from across eight government departments to look beyond just housing and consider employment, training, rehabilitation and healthcare.

The ministerial group on homelessness looks at areas such as better health outcomes for homeless people, through closer working between local authorities, hospitals and primary care services and the reduction of homelessness amongst ex-offenders, which is linked with re-offending in many cases.

It comes as Communities Minister Andrew Stunell visited the Broadway Centre in Hammersmith, one of the many centres across the country run by the voluntary sector, to see first-hand the vital role the sector plays in helping people off the streets and to rebuild their lives.

Today's funding is for key national homelessness charities and for rough sleeping services across London.

  * £8m to Crisis over the next two years to expand its scheme to get single homeless, including ex-offenders, into the private rented sector and to support them in the accommodation
  * £1.5m to Homeless Link, the national umbrella organisation for homelessness charities, to help the voluntary sector across the country work more effectively with the single homeless and to promote good practice
  * 3.4m for the National Homelessness Advice Service run by Shelter and CAB; NHAS supports the provision of effective debt and housing advice by the CAB and local authorities across England
  * £150,000 to UK Refuges Online which helps tackle domestic violence
  * £8.45m a year to the Mayor to commission and run pan-London rough sleeping services currently run by the Department for Communities and Local Governmnet. These include emergency accommodation, cold weather shelters, a street rescue service and tenancy sustainment teams.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:

> ""Homelessness is a very real and worrying problem in our country and charities play a key role in providing shelter, food and support to those who find themselves sleeping on the street.
> 
> ""Today I have seen their dedication and generosity at first hand, and how funding such as that we are announcing helps provide key support to the voluntary sector to help us meet our objectives on tackling homelessness, and the Big Society.""

Crisis Chief Executive, Leslie Morphy said:

> ""Given the current pressures facing local services and with homelessness and rough sleeping a very real issue in communities across the country at Crisis we believe it is crucial to focus on single people who are too often not a priority and help them to overcome barriers to renting privately. 
> 
> ""Single homeless people rarely meet the criteria to acquire council accommodation and finding a flat in the private rented sector can be a complex and expensive option. They need advice and support but in many areas of the country, these specialist services are not there.
> 
> ""Crisis has just set up some 49 new services across England, and we warmly welcome today's announcement of further funding for the PRS Access Development Programme which will enable us to establish such schemes in significantly more locations and secure the future of successful projects already in place.
> 
> ""These schemes will help people overcome financial barriers, match them to good landlords and help more individuals avoid or escape the perils of homelessness.""

As London has particularly high levels of rough sleeping, and the Mayor of London has shown strong leadership on the issue, funding and oversight for all pan-London services will move to the Greater London Assembly.

The move will give them the full flexibility over delivery of their homelessness services and allow them more flexibility in meeting the Mayor's commitment to ending rough sleeping in London by 2012.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:

> ""The Government has rightly decided that London is best placed to deliver the services it needs to end rough sleeping by 2012 and this enables us to build on the excellent work that already goes on at the borough level. We can now step up a gear in our drive to end rough sleeping in the capital for good.""

3. The Department also issued a public consultation on evaluating the extent of rough sleeping in July 2010. A summary of the consultation responses received can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/evaluatingroughsleepingresponse](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/evaluatingroughsleepingresponse).

4. Following the consultation the new guidance for councils, E_valuating the extent of rough sleeping: A new approach_ was published in September 2010 and can be found at: [www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/roughsleepingevaluate](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/roughsleepingevaluate).

The rough sleeping statistics for autumn 2010 are the first to be published under this new guidance. The main changes under the new guidance are

  * conducting street counts is a choice for individual local authorities
  * where a local authority decides not to count they should submit a robust estimate of the number of people rough sleeping on a typical night - where possible they should draw on information from the voluntary sector in their area
  * the definition of rough sleeper has been expanded - in particular the definition of 'bedded down' now includes rough sleepers about to bed down
  * encouraging neighbouring authorities to count on the same night
  * gearing start times for counts to suit local circumstances to ensure all those bedded down are recorded
  * having Homeless Link (the national body for homelessness charities) verify all counts instead of government officials

5. At the Spending Review, the Coalition Government announced a £400m investment to tackle homelessness. This includes £326m in grants for local authorities, and £74m for the voluntary sector.

6. Crisis is the national charity for single homeless people dedicated to ending homelessness by delivering life-changing services and campaigning for change. The Crisis PRS (private rented sector) Access Development Programme was launched in 2009-2010 to help single homeless people find and sustain good quality accommodation in the private rented sector (PRS). Building on over 10 years experience in this area, Crisis provided funding and support to 49 community based projects which will assist over 1,500 people into sustainable accommodation. This project is funded by the DCLG and supported by the Ministry of Justice, Homeless Link and the National Landlords Association. For full information on the programme, how homeless people can be successfully housed in the private rented sector and details of existing access schemes across the country please see the best practice website Crisis manages: [www.privaterentedsector.org.uk](http://www.privaterentedsector.org.uk/) (external link).

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/1918433,Volunteers save local Tourist Information Point,"Dedicated volunteers in the picturesque town of Easingwold, North Yorkshire, have worked together to keep their local Tourist Information Point open. The group of 50 volunteers set up a steering group and began discussions with the council to prove they could successfully run the facility themselves.

The Localism Bill has been introduced to help communities do just this. By shifting power from central government into the hands of citizens, communities can take responsibility for vital services and decide how they should be run. Those who know their local area best know what services they require, and the residents of Easingwold knew how important the Tourist Information Point was for their community.

The centre was able to remain open with the aid of grants from Hambleton District Council and North Yorkshire County Council. Hambleton District Council also helped by leasing the premises at a low rent and small lottery grants have assisted with the production of leaflets and a website.

![Image of Easingwold Tourist Information Centre](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1919304)

As the office is run solely by volunteers, annual running costs are a low £1500, and are met by various fundraising activities, the proceeds of which go back into the Tourist Information Point.

The knowledge the volunteers have of the local area is beneficial to both visitors and the wider community, who can benefit from increased business and tourism. Many of the volunteers are of retirement age so have the opportunity to re-use their skills, pass on their knowledge and put something back into the community.

The future looks bright for the Tourist Information Point and it will soon celebrate its fourth birthday. A ten-year lease has also been secured on the premises, enabling the volunteers to consider the long-term plans for the facility.

Other communities seem to be following the example set by the volunteers of Easingwold, as Treasurer and Secretary, Frank Johnston-Banks said:

> ""We are becoming well known for what we do and how well we do it, with the result that other similar centres visit us to find our secret. But there is no secret. If somebody gets paid, they do the job because they have to. If somebody volunteers they do the job because they want to - and they put more into it, resulting in a better organisation"".

With this sort of ethos sitting at the heart of the office, it seems as though the next ten years will be just as successful. The volunteers have demonstrated the amazing achievements of a group who united together for a cause that has clear long-term benefits for the wider community.

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1942372,Warwickshire flag to fly at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Warwickshire has been hoisted outside the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Warwickshire is rich with history, and has played an important role during England's timeline - be this during the age of the Roman Empire, the English Civil War or in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605.

Probably the most famous Warwickshire person of all, William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564, and is now regarded as a literary genius whose creative achievement has never been surpassed in any age.

In the sporting sphere the modern Rugby rules and practice, although developed by a number of institutions across Great Britain, first originated in Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire.

The flag of Warwickshire depicts a bear and ragged staff. The origins of these emblems are lost in the distant past, but have been associated with the earls of Warwick since at least as early as the 14th century. William Dugdale, writing in the 1650s, said that Arthgal, an Earl of Warwick at the time of King Arthur, thought that his name came from the Welsh ""artos"" or bear. He also suggested that the ragged staff was chosen because Morvidus, Earl of Warwick, killed a giant with the broken branch of a tree. Of course, neither of these earls really existed and Dugdale was just recalling medieval legends. The bear was a common heraldic device and implied boldness and courage.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Cllr Alan Farnell, Leader of Warwickshire County Council, said:

> ""We are fortunate to live in such a beautiful part of the country with many picturesque towns and villages including Shakespeare's Stratford, historic Warwick and its fine castle, and Rugby, where sport famously originated.
> 
> ""Warwickshire has a rich history and we are justly proud of our county and its emblem, the bear and ragged staff, which dates back to the 14th century. I am actually in London this week on county council business and will hopefully get chance to see the ceremonial flag flying outside Whitehall for myself.""

Lord Lieutenant Martin Dunne added:

> ""It is a tremendous honour to have our standard flown as part of the Department for Communities' celebration of our national culture and heritage. The Warwickshire bear is the symbol which helps give us a sense of identity and bonds our communities together, so we are thrilled that it will be in the skies of the capital alongside the Union Flag.""

> ""We should be concerned about any move to strip individuals of their right to celebrate who they are. For some Christians, wearing a crucifix or cross or carrying a rosary is very much part of their faith, although it is a personal choice and not a formal requirement of their religion.
> 
> ""The issue is not whether faith perspectives and religious voices should be included and tolerated in the public sphere, for that right is incontestable, but the manner in which such a right is exercised and any restrictions that may be necessary to impose on that right.
> 
> ""It is reasonable, and lawful, for Christians to wear a discreet symbol of their faith as long as this does not get in the way of their work. Indeed, given the massive contribution of Christians to our country over centuries, it is to be welcomed.
> 
> ""Where religious symbols do not physically interfere with a person's work but employers have instituted dress codes prohibiting them, employees have good grounds to ask for the code to be reconsidered. We urge employers to be flexible.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/newsstories/newsroom/2003517,Welcome rise in affordable housing,"Housing Minister Grant Shapps has welcomed new figures showing the largest increase in the supply of affordable homes since the mid-1990s.

New figures published this week show there were 60,630 additional affordable homes delivered last year - an increase of five per cent on the numbers supplied in 2009/10.

These new figures also showed an increase of nearly a fifth in the numbers of new social homes, to over 39,000. And over 20,000 homes were provided through intermediate affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership and shared equity schemes aimed at helping struggling first-time buyers.

Through the New Homes Bonus the Government matches the council tax raised on all additional homes for six years - but councils also receive extra funding for every affordable home they build.

This week's figures mean that councils can expect to receive a share of over £21million for the affordable homes they've approved - on top of the matched council tax on each new property.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:

> ""Reviving a housebuilding market that was brought to its knees takes time, so I am encouraged by today's figures which show the highest number of additional affordable homes being delivered over the past year since the mid-1990s. Our efforts to get Britain building again are continuing, with a £4.5billion Affordable Homes programme set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 new homes over the next four years.
> 
> ""Thanks to this increase in affordable homes, councils across the country will next year benefit from a share of over £21million through the New Homes Bonus, on top of the funding they can expect as we match the council tax raised on new properties for six years.
> 
> ""I would urge all councils to start discussing with their residents how they would like to see this extra New Homes Bonus funding spent, so for the first time they can see the benefits of this additional growth for themselves.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1859816,Whitehall set to relax grip on councils with first ever review of local government's legal duties,"In another major step to free up local government, councils are being asked for the bureaucratic burdens they wish to throw away in the first ever central review of their statutory duties, Decentralisation Minister Greg Clark announced today.

Historically central government has been prescriptive about how councils should serve their communities and virtually every function councils undertake has a legal duty attached to it, set out in numerous Acts of Parliament.

To date no Government has ever assessed the cumulative burden imposed by the hundreds of legal duties placed on local government. Mr Clark believes that Government needs to be clear about the current demands placed on councils and decide which duties remain relevant to serving the public. The Review will proactively identify old and unnecessary burdens or barriers preventing councils from getting on with their job. However the Government will not remove statutory protections for vital frontline services such as libraries and child protection.

Today the Department of Communities and Local Government working with departments across Whitehall has published an initial list of more than 1,200 legal duties imposed mainly by primary legislation. Whilst many of these may be vital others are not and councils will themselves advise ministers of any duties missed at this stage, if any create unwanted burdens and which ones could potentially be repealed (see link, top right). 

The Coalition Government is determined to give councils the freedom and discretion they need to get things done without Whitehall red tape and regulation tying them down. The Review will start the process of simplifying legal requirements on local government while still protecting necessary safeguards and ensuring greater local transparency and accountability to local taxpayers.

Mr Clark said:

> ""Historically Whitehall has prescribed how councils should conduct their business. As a result hundreds of accumulated legal requirements have become attached to the functions councils undertake.
> 
> ""Until now no Government has comprehensively reviewed the relevance and worth of these legal duties to check if councils aren't being smothered by top down bureaucracy. That's why today we're asking councils to tell us which duties actually serve the public and which ones serve to create unnecessary burdens.
> 
> ""Rather than sending reams of paperwork to officials in Whitehall, councils need to be more accountable to their local residents. I am determined to release councils from the grip of Westminster micro-management by busting these bureaucratic barriers and burdens and letting them get on with their job. The transparency agenda will empower the local press and public to hold their local councils to account and ensure greater value for money over local spending. Government rules and regulations should be there to help councils deliver for the public - not stand in their way.""

The Localism Bill, currently going through Parliament, is already set to remove some of these duties. Ministers are committed to continuing to bust down the barriers that hinder councils and residents from managing their own lives.

The Government has already abolished thousands of central targets on local government, ended the costly inspection regime and announced work to streamline data requirements imposed on local government.

Ministers believe instead of streams of regulation and red tape pouring out of Whitehall, councils need to be freed to deliver local priorities. Mr Clark launched an online portal so councils, community groups, local institutions and individuals can highlight bureaucratic barriers stopping them from taking action they believe would improve their area: [http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/).

#### Updated 16 March 2011 to clarify that duties on frontline services will be protected.

### Notes to editor

  1. Today the Government has announced the review of statutory duties which government departments place on local authorities. 16 departments and agencies of government are publishing their initial draft list of statutory duties for which their departments are responsible covering wide ranging and diverse interests such as housing, planning, crime and policing, adult social care, public health, equality, the environment and licensing - to highlight a few. The list is not exhaustive - it reflects mainly those duties imposed by primary legislation for which departments and their predecessors are responsible. DCLG's draft list has included statutory and non-statutory guidance that applies to the duties.
  2. For DCLG, for the time being, it also excludes duties stemming from Parts 1 and 2 of the Building Act 1984 as we are in the process of undertaking a separate review of these. There are also other reviews underway that are likely to impact on this work such as the Law Commission's review of adult social care.

![Wiltshire flag](http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/1918159.jpg)Wiltshire flag flying outside DCLG

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Characterised by its high downland and wide valleys, Wiltshire is home to the famous Salisbury Plain and the location of the UNESCO-listed Stonehenge as well as the Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks. It is also the main training area in the UK of the British Army.

Locals, nicknamed moonrakers from an apocryphal tale of alcohol smuggling, reside in a county famous for its Neolithic history and in Salisbury Cathedral possess not only one of the finest examples of Early-English architecture but also Britain's tallest church spire.

The flag of Wiltshire features the local Great Bustard bird which has been recently re-introduced to the Salisbury plain. It is partly based on the flag of the Wiltshire Council, including the alternating stripes of green and white that represent the grassy downs of the county and their chalk underlay.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that binds communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Mr John Bush, OBE, KStJ, HM Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire, said:

> ""I am delighted the government has introduced this initiative, which gives a visible sign of public service provision to the electorate. Wiltshire is an historic county which contains many wonderful attractions from Stonehenge and Salisbury Cathedral to Avebury and Wootton Bassett.
> 
> ""There is a wide diversity of agriculture, military activity and commerce across the county, with many major companies centred in Swindon, providing a rich commercial and cultural mix. Residents are proud of their county and I feel privileged to be Her Majesty's Lord Lieutenant in such a beautiful part of England.""

Jane Scott, Leader of Wiltshire Council said:

> ""Wiltshire is a beautiful county and this is a proud moment for us all. The flying of this flag will help promote Wiltshire and its identity.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1946479,Worcestershire flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Worcestershire has been hoisted outside the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

During the Middle Ages, much of Worcestershire's economy was based on the wool trade, and many areas of its dense forests, such as Malvern Chase, were royal hunting grounds.

In the nineteenth century, Worcester was a centre for the manufacture of gloves; the town of Kidderminster became a centre for carpet manufacture, and Redditch specialised in the manufacture of needles, springs and hooks. Malvern was one of the centres of the 19th century rise in English spa towns due to Malvern water being believed to be very pure, containing ""nothing at all"".

The modern era saw canals driven through from the north of the county, the 'Black Country' to supplement and conjoin with the rivers in the industrial revolution's need for swift transportation.

It is claimed that the county was the inspiration for The Shire, a region of J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional Middle-earth, described in _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_. Tolkien was thought to have named Bilbo Baggins' house 'Bag End' after his Aunt Jane's Worcestershire farm. Tolkien wrote of Worcestershire: ""Any corner of that county (however fair or squalid) is in an indefinable way 'home' to me, as no other part of the world is.""

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Cornwall and Yorkshire - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that bind communities together.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Cllr Adrian Hardman, Leader of Worcestershire County Council said:

> ""I am very proud that the flag of Worcestershire will be flying in Westminster. It is a great opportunity to encourage our local communities and residents to celebrate all that is best about our county and its heritage.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1840621,York and North Yorkshire and Enterprise M3 join local enterprise partnership network,"The new local enterprise partnerships for York and North Yorkshire and Enterprise M3 were approved today by Decentralisation Minister, Greg Clark and Minister for Business, Mark Prisk.

They join the 28 partnerships formed since the Government's Local Growth White Paper was published in October last year. Ministers believe this shows clearly the local enthusiasm for partnerships and a real ambition to renew growth from the ground up. The thirty local enterprise partnerships now cover over seventy per cent of England's population - 1.4m businesses and 16m employees.

Local enterprise partnerships bring together local business and civic leaders, working to support their local economy. They will operate within a geography that reflects natural economic areas and will provide the vision, knowledge and strategic leadership needed to drive sustainable private sector growth and job creation in their area.

York and North Yorkshire aims to secure investment for next generation broadband, promote enterprise and support its important tourist economy and food and agricultural sectors.

Enterprise M3 - covering parts of Hampshire and Surrey - has a population of 1m and £25bn economic area built around IT, financial services and research and development. It aims to continue its sustainable economic growth, attracting, retaining and creating businesses locally improving skills, broadband coverage and transport links.

Greg Clark said:

> ""Congratulations to York and North Yorkshire, and Enterprise M3 for becoming the latest local enterprise partnerships to be invited to put their board in place.
> 
> ""Our local enterprise partnership network continues to spread across the country showing that there is real local enthusiasm, ambition and ingenuity, and proof that central government does not need to micromanage our grassroots economic growth.
> 
> ""Local enterprise partnerships will bring people together - local authorities from across administrative divides, business leaders and civic leaders - in a common goal: to promote jobs, growth and prosperity in their local area.""

Mark Prisk added:

> ""I am pleased that we are able to ask another two local enterprise partnerships to appoint their boards. The partnerships have an important role to play in driving local economic growth and creating a strong environment for business.
> 
> ""We are continuing to assess proposals for further partnerships across England, so that soon more local communities will benefit from the knowledge and expertise of the private sector and the opportunities that growth brings.""

http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/1957108,Yorkshire flag flies at Department for Communities and Local Government,"The flag representing the historic county of Yorkshire has been hoisted outside the offices of the Department for Communities and Local Government to celebrate Yorkshire Day.

The Battle of Minden was fought on the 1 August 1759 and soldiers from the 51st Regiment of foot (a Yorkshire regiment, first raised in Leeds in 1755), played a significant part in the victory gained. Reports from the period suggest that the soldiers picked roses and wore them on their uniforms, either during the battle or afterwards.

The white rose has long been a badge associated with Yorkshire. Some regiments still remember the battle, on its anniversary, as Minden Day and wear roses on their uniforms. Those with Yorkshire connections wear white roses on their uniforms.

When the Yorkshire Ridings Society first promoted Yorkshire Day, in 1975, it highlighted the link with Minden Day, also 1 August, because of the use of the rose by the Yorkshire soldiers who fought in the battle.

Within the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are areas which are widely considered to be among the greenest in England, due to the vast stretches of unspoiled countryside in the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors and to the open aspect of some of the major cities. This has led to Yorkshire sometimes being dubbed 'God's Own County'.

To celebrate the important place counties play in the nation's cultural heritage Secretary of State Eric Pickles has asked that English county standards be flown alongside the Union Flag outside the Department's Eland House headquarters in Victoria.

Flags are being flown for a week at a time in alphabetical order or - in cases such as Yorkshire and Cornwall - to coincide with particular county days.

Eric Pickles said:

> ""England's counties continue to form an important part of our cultural and local identity in this country and many people remain deeply attached to their home county. This sense of pride and shared identity is one of the things that bind communities together.
> 
> ""I began this initiative by raising the flag of my adopted county of Essex and it gives me immense pleasure to see the flag of the county of my birth, Yorkshire, raised as the final county flag to be flown.
> 
> ""The historic English counties are one of the oldest forms of local government in Western Europe. Their roots run deep. And no amount of administrative reshuffling can delete these longstanding and cherished local identities.""

Councillor David Horton, the Lord Mayor of York, said:

> ""As a proud Yorkshireman, by both birth and upbringing, I am more than happy to support any event in that recognises 1 August - Yorkshire Day. As have City of York Lord Mayors in the past, I will be celebrating Yorkshire Day with many Yorkshire Civic Parties with a church service and lunch in the City of Wakefield this year. I send everyone in Yorkshire best wishes in their celebrations on 1 August.""

Roger Sewell, Chairman of the Yorkshire Ridings Society said:

> ""The flying of county flags outside the Department for Communities is a timely reminder of the importance of counties to the people who live in them.
> 
> ""Counties are widely used to identify locations in radio, TV and newspaper reporting. However, maps which show the counties are few and far between.  Similarly, county boundary signs have often been removed where they do not coincide with modern administrative boundaries.
> 
> ""Societies such as the Yorkshire Ridings Society and the Association of British Counties continue to campaign for the marking of county boundaries on maps and on the ground.
> 
> ""Older than many of the monuments and historic buildings on which money is lavished to preserve them, our counties require only that they are recognised for them to remain an important part of our heritage and our daily lives.""
