It has been issued to accompany the launch of the final Decent Homes bidding round for the Round 6 Arms Length Management Organisations (ALMOs) and the 2006 Housing Transfer Programme. The guidance explains a number of Decent Homes policy amendments and seeks to clarify issues that have arisen in the implementation of the programme.

Tremendous progress has been made in delivering the Decent Homes programme, with over half the task being completed and with the last few local authorities putting in place their programmes for delivery. The Decent Homes programme has already made a real difference to the lives of tenants by not only making improvements to social housing but also through improved services. By the time we get to 2010 we expect that, around 3.6 million homes will have had work carried out to them, many more than the 2.2 million non-decent homes we started with in 1997. This additional work will have prevented many homes becoming non-decent, and will have dealt with those that fell below decent between 1997 and 2010.

In revising this guidance, Communities and Local Government (Communities and Local Government - formerly the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister or ODPM) is setting out how it sees social landlords building on the success of the programme working more flexibly to go beyond the Decent Homes programme to undertake more radical solutions to transform some of the poorest neighbourhoods into mixed, sustainable communities.",Free,7 June 2006,07-Jun-2006,"Good practice and guidance, Strategies and action plans",,http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/decenthome?view=Order+form&supplierId=1403822,Order this publication,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/pdf/138355.pdf,A Decent Home: Definition and guidance for implementation - June 2006 update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are the type of residential tenancy agreements used by most private landlords and housing associations. There are a number of matters on which landlords or tenants must follow certain rules laid down in the regulations. In some cases it may be necessary for them to complete  a form  that proposes an action that may affect the other party to the tenancy agreement. The nine forms are listed below and can be downloaded.

These forms are known as _Prescribed Forms_ because the wording in them has been carefully drafted to ensure that the person completing the form and the person on whom it is served may understand what is being proposed and what they may do in response. Failure to serve the correct form may invalidate the action that is being proposed.

You may not alter the wording in these forms unless a form says you may do so. If you alter the wording, the form may be invalidated. You must also comply with any notice periods set out in the form.

These and other landlord and tenant forms may also be available to purchase from legal stationery companies. Legal stationers also supply tenancy agreements that have been carefully drafted to comply with the law. It is strongly recommended that landlords only use tenancy agreements that have been drafted to comply with relevant legal requirements.

If you are unsure about completing one of these forms or what to do if you have been served with one, you should seek legal advice. General information about assured and assured shorthold tenancies can be found on the _Private renting: tenants' rights and responsibilities (booklets and forms)_ and _Letting your property: landlords' rights and responsibilities (booklets and forms)_ pages.

The Schedules are to be agreed between the local housing authority (""the Council"") and the TMO and must be in accordance with the statutory guidance given by the Secretary of State under regulation 7 of the _Housing (Right to Manage) Regulations 1994_.

The guidance sets out the statutory guidance, which is highlighted to distinguish it, and, in addition, non-statutory guidance which forms the remaining text.

The purpose of the non-statutory guidance is simply to assist Councils and TMOs to draft the Schedules to their particular agreement in accordance with the statutory guidance but it should not be treated as binding.",£7.00 (free to download below),8 August 2005,08-Aug-2005,Good practice and guidance,1851128069,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/pdf/381303.pdf,Volume 6: (i) Model Code of Governance (ii) Guidance on a Code of Confidentiality,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/doc/381381.doc,Volume 6: (i) Model Code of Governance (ii) Guidance on a Code of Confidentiality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It uses an approach to estimating the benefits of social policy interventions that has previously been used in a number of areas and will be familiar to anyone who has used the Supporting People Financial Benefits Model.

This guidance is provided as an aid for using the Tool for developing a business case for handyperson services. Handyperson services are complex in nature, varying across local authority areas and in the nature of services interventions delivered. The examples and guidance provided are not intended to be exhaustive but are aimed at providing a checklist of key details to be included within the business case.

This guidance consists of three sections:

  1. How to use the tool to extract the data for specific handyperson services.
  2. A detailed look at the evidence used to develop the Handyperson Services Financial Benefits Tool.

Under section 155 of the Housing Act 1985, former social tenants who dispose of a property within a specified period after purchasing it under the Right to Buy scheme have to repay upon demand by the former landlord all or part of the discount they received on purchase, unless it is an exempted disposal. Section 185 of the Housing Act 2004 amends section 155 by extending the specified period from 3 years to 5 years. Section 155 (as amended) and the new section 155B also apply to the Rent to Mortgage scheme.

Section 185 of the 2004 Act also clarifies that former landlords have discretion not to demand that former social tenants should repay part or all of the discount they received. This note offers guidance on when in the Government's view it might be appropriate to exercise this discretion.",Free,20 January 2005,20-Jan-2005,Legislation and policy,9781409821694,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/pdf/320232.pdf,Right to buy - the use of discretionary powers on repayment of discount,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
