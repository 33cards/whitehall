## Door to door Journey Planner

![Image: door to door icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/doortodoor)

The core feature of the Transport Direct Portal is the Door-to-door journey planner. A world first, this plans journeys from door to door using all feasible means of public transport anywhere in Great Britain; at the same time it can plan the journey by car, allowing the user to compare car and public transport journey options (Figure 5).

**Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys**

![Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/fig5a.jpg)

![Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/fig5b.jpg)

Once the journeys have been planned:

  * The costs of the journey options can be provided as can the CO2 emissions;
  * Tickets can be purchased from online retailers (through an automated hand-off) or telephone numbers provided for telephone-based retailers;
  * The route, or individual sections of it, can be displayed on a map;
  * Calling points for a service can be displayed;
  * All information can be printed in order to provide an informative itinerary to take on the journey.

When **connecting people to places**, it is important that users can find their journey origin and destination from appropriate gazetteers or directly from the map. Transport Direct has created a rich set of gazetteers, based on postcodes, addresses, transport locations, places and even local attractions.

  * [Single mode Journey Planners](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/JourneyPlannerInput.aspx)

![Image: single mode journey planners icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/singlejourney)

In many cases, the traveller may only want to find out about part of a journey or travelling options using specific modes. Consequently, Transport Direct provides a range of modal journey planners:

  * Find a train;
  * Find a flight;
  * Find a car route;
  * Find a coach;
  * Find a bus;
  * Find a cycle route.

## Live travel information

![Image: live travel news icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/livetravelnews)

Underpinning Transport Direct is comprehensive provision of live travel information, sourced from authoritative sources and recognised intermediaries.

The live travel news is updated every 15 minutes and can be filtered by:

  * Region / all of Great Britain;
  * Public transport / road / all types of transport;
  * Major / recent / all delays;
  * Incidents / road & rail engineering works / all types of travel news;
  * All road or public transport incidents can also be displayed on a map for geographic referencing.

Transport Direct also provides links to up-to-the-minute arrival and departure information for rail, bus services (where provided) and flights from the definitive sources such as National Rail, Transport for London, bus service information providers and airport operators.

## Car Parking and Park-and-Ride information

![Image: park and ride icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/carparking)

  * [**Car Parking and Park-and-Ride information on Transport Direct**](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/LiveTravel/DepartureBoards.aspx?NotFindAMode=true)

Planning a car journey from door to door is straightforward when there is readily available on-road or off-road car parking. However, this is not always the case. Much more useful would be to plan to the nearest car park (within walking distance of the destination) or to a park-and-ride service and complete the journey by public transport.

Transport Direct has car park information for over 10,000 car parks, covering major towns and cities across Great Britain, and the range is being constantly expanded.

Using the ""find nearest car park"" service, the user can now find the nearest car park to their destination and also get information on costs and opening times. Car Parks are also shown on Transport Direct's maps, enabling journeys to be planned to and from these locations.

Transport Direct also has park-and-ride information for many cities, with details on cost and opening hours. The ""plan to park and ride"" service plans car journeys to and from the best park-and-ride location for the direction of travel to that city.

## Calculating Carbon Emissions

![Image: carbon calculator screen shot](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/carboncalculator)

  * [Calculating Carbon Emissions on Transport Direct](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/FindCarParkInput.aspx)

Transport Direct launched a car ""carbon calculator"" at the end of 2006, which is believed to be another world first. This feature enables the user to calculate the amount of CO2 emitted for a specific journey planned on Transport Direct, taking account of predicted levels of congestion on the roads and so enabling greater accuracy in the calculation of the emitted CO2.

In April 2007, Transport Direct launched an equivalent public transport carbon calculator. This enables users to find out how much CO2 is emitted from their specific public transport journey and compares this with car and other modes of transport.

It should be noted that comparing car CO2 with public transport CO2 is not comparing like for like, where the predicted CO2 emission for a:

  * Car journey is based on a specified number of occupants;
  * Public transport journey is based on an estimate of the number of passengers.

## What's New

Transport Direct recently developed the London 2012 Olympic Spectator Journey Planner which was based on the original Transport Direct back office.",guidance,improving-local-transport,,background-to-transport-direct,department-for-transport,29/06/2007,29/06/2007,,,,42,[]

"[""Body cannot include invalid formatting or JavaScript""]",new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/key-metrics-and-statistics,Transport Direct key metrics and statistics,Usage statistics for Transport Direct.,"Transport Direct's usage continues to grow steadily month on month. The pie chart below shows user session figures for August 2012. Since its launch in December 2004, Transport Direct has achieved over 110 million user sessions.

![Transport Direct pie chart](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/files/2012/09/transport-direct-pie-chart.jpg)

The [Transport Direct Portal](http://www.transportdirect.info) provides a one-stop-shop for users to make intelligent travel choices based on its rich set of travel and transport information and services. Part of connecting people to places (Transport Direct's strapline) is to provide information on those places. This gives context to the journey by providing, for example, a map showing the location of a bus stop or a list of the nearest car parks to the destination. Location information and travel news both help the user to make intelligent travel choices and, as such, make better use of the transport infrastructure.

Transport Direct achieves an average of:

  * 378,000 user sessions per week
  * 2,000,000 pages per week
  * 12,500 mobile pages per week
  * 5,300 mobile user sessions per week
  * 10,100 Digital TV Web pages per week
  * 830 Digital TV User sessions per week

A set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were set out in Transport Direct's original business plan in order to assess the effectiveness of Transport Direct, including:

  * Initial achievement of one million unique visitor sessions in the first year of operation to confirm visibility and usage. This was achieved in June 2005, six months after launch.
  * A goal of ten million unique visitor sessions by 2006 to establish Transport Direct as a major source of travel and transport information. This was achieved on 1st December 2006.

Transport Direct developed the Spectator Journey Planner for the 2012 Olympics and final usage was just short of 4 million sessions with almost 2.75 million unique users.",guidance,improving-local-transport,,background-to-transport-direct,department-for-transport,29/06/2007,29/06/2007,,,,52,[]

We call these measures 'smarter choices' and they are becoming an increasingly important area for the Department for Transport. Smarter choices include local programmes to encourage school, workplace and individualised travel planning; improving public transport information and marketing services; setting up web sites for car share schemes and supporting car clubs; and encouraging teleworking and teleconferencing.

This guide has been written for local authorities ? both members and officers ? and explains what we know about smarter choice measures, based on the latest research. It explains how local authorities can use them to improve traffic flows and make life more pleasant for local people. The research on which this document is based was carried out during 2003-04 and looked at the impact that these measures can have on traffic. The final report, 'Smarter Choices ? Changing the Way We Travel'was published in July this year in parallel with the Department's White Paper 'The Future of Transport'. It provides firm evidence of the impact of smarter choices on traffic, particularly where local authorities have promoted them vigorously.

The challenge now for local authorities is to recognise the potential benefits of smarter choice measures so that they make them an integral part of their transport strategies. Not only can they reduce congestion, but they give people genuine travel choices. They also contribute cost-effectively to other Government priorities, such as improving accessibility and social inclusion, encouraging regeneration, reducing pollution and carbon emissions and helping to increase levels of physical activity.

Smarter choices are techniques for influencing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable options such as encouraging school, workplace and individualised travel planning. They also seek to improve public transport and marketing services such as travel awareness campaigns, setting up websites for car share schemes, supporting car clubs and encouraging teleworking.

## Travel plans

A travel plan is a package of measures produced by schools or employers to encourage parents or staff to use alternatives to single-occupancy car-use. Such a plan for example, could include: car sharing schemes; a commitment to improve cycling facilities; a dedicated bus service or restricted car parking allocations. It might also promote flexible-working practices such as remote access and video conferencing.

Travel plans can offer real benefits not only to organisations, pupils and/or employees, but also the community that surrounds it. They may help relieve local parking or congestion problems or improve public transport connections across the area. They may also relieve stress by reducing delays, or providing the opportunity for staff to cut their travel commitments by working from home on occasion.

The Environmental Research and Consultancy Department (ERCD) of the Civil Aviation Authority estimates the noise exposures around the London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) on behalf of the Department for Transport. The magnitude and extent of the aircraft noise around these airports are depicted on maps by contours of constant aircraft noise index (Leq) values. The contours are generated by a computer model validated with noise measurements, which calculates the emissions and propagation of noise from arriving and departing air traffic.

## Detail

ERCD produce annual reports on noise exposure contours at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and previous copies of these - back to 1997- are available on this website. These are detailed reports and essential reading for those wishing to understand both how noise exposure contours are produced and how they should be interpreted.

The annual reports include small scale diagrams of noise exposure contours which provide an overall impression of their proximity to major towns.

For those wishing to see more detailed representation of noise exposure contours on the ground, ERCD also produces contours overlaid on larger scale Ordnance Survey paper maps ( 1:50,000 ) or, more recently, in AutoCad DXF format (previously supplied on CD-ROM), the latter primarily used by specialist users such as town planners, consultants etc. Both of these have traditionally been available for purchase from the Department as described in the annual reports.

## Change to presentation of 2005 contours onwards

Annual reports for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are available on the website as before.

With effect from 2005, additional representation of noise exposure contours on Ordnance Survey maps has been made available on this website in two formats.

## PDF

**For the non specialist user** in particular, a PDF version of each of the large scale Ordnance Survey maps is available for viewing and downloading. Please note, however, that these are large documents and may take some time to download.

## AutoCad DXF

**For the specialist user** requiring greater detail, AutoCad DXF files are available on the website for download. (These allow the user to plot the contours on any scale of map).

Please note that in order to gain the best reproduction of contours on a larger scale Ordnance Survey map, it is necessary to have software that is capable of reading DXF files.

Please also note that in view of the large size of the files, they have been compressed using WinZip and will need to be 'unzipped' after being downloaded.

## Printed Maps

Contours overlaid on large scale Ordnance Survey paper maps (1:50,000) continue to be available, at a charge, as described in the annual reports. Although the information/scale presented is exactly same as in the PDF version (see above), the printed maps are larger.

The Rail Industry Research Strategy (RIRS) was published in December 2007. It established a set of strategic priorities for rail research aimed at supporting the delivery of the rail industry's long-term vision for the railway as expressed in the Rail Technical Strategy and Rail White Paper. The RIRS also considered how rail-related research is managed, delivered and funded. A set of 'Enabling Actions' was proposed for development to support the implementation of the strategy.

This Implementation Plan sets out each of these Enabling Actions, focusing on short-term activities and plans for 2008/09. The Enabling Actions tackle three main areas:

  * Strategic research - to encourage a step-change in the delivery of strategic research, focused on meeting the long-term challenges of the railway as set out in the Rail Technical Strategy. This is a priority of the RIRS. The relevant Enabling Actions are:
    * Establishing a client group for strategic research
    * Developing a framework for strategic research
    * A new strategic research programme
    * Developing route maps to the railway of the future
  * Collaboration - to ensure that best use is made of existing funding by leveraging in additional resources from the private sector, from Europe and from other non-rail public sector sources. The Enabling Actions comprise:
    * Developing an additional co-funding mechanism for RSSB research to encourage partnership with the private sector
    * Collaborative working with Research Councils and other research funders
    * Engaging effectively in European research
  * Delivery mechanisms - to identify, promote and adopt best practice in the delivery of research. The Enabling Actions are:
    * Improving the transition from research to technology development
    * Knowledge management to capture and make use of the results of research
    * Technology transfer from other industries or other countries
    * Estimating benefits at proposal stage
    * Evaluating the impacts of completed rail research

Each of these Enabling Actions has an identified owner, agreed long-term aims and short-term objectives.

Finally, the Implementation Plan also sets out how resource requirements for rail research can be evaluated. In the short-term, priority actions are aimed at achieving better value for money from the resources currently available and providing incremental increases where this can be justified. In the medium term, an approach which seeks to establish the level of research funding needed in its totality is more appropriate. These initiatives will be progressed in parallel with the 12 Enabling Actions.
