The Department for Transport has given final approval to the scheme which will see work on a replacement bridge over the Portsmouth to London railway line at Cosham. The original bridge was built to carry a dual carriageway road but is now too weak to do so and traffic has been restricted to a single lane in each direction for a number of years.

The new bridge will allow the dual carriageway to be reinstated as well as removing any weight limit, bringing the bridge up to current national standards.

The scheme will restore the full standard of the bridge improving access to the local area and aiding the local economy by reducing congestion and ensuring that the route can be fully used, especially by the many buses which serve it.

Norman Baker said:

> This is an important scheme that will restore the full capacity of this route, help boost the local economy by reducing congestion and ensure journey time reliability for bus passengers.
> 
> The £11 million we are putting into this scheme shows that the coalition government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country needs to drive economic growth.

The Northern Road Bridge scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the Spending Review process. Work can now start on the construction with the new bridge scheduled to open in October 2013.

Central to the project, Go Smarter to Work - Tyne and Wear Sustainable Transport Package, will be measures to relieve congestion on the A1 Western Bypass and make travelling to work in the area quicker and easier.

There will be new infrastructure such as bus priority lanes, cycle and walking routes and cycle parking at key transport interchanges. Those travelling on public transport will also benefit from real-time travel information facilities.

Innovative ideas have been developed to help those in areas where accessing work can be a significant problem and those living in remote rural areas will benefit from a scooter hire scheme to help them get to employment and training hubs.

The Department for Transport funding sees the final allocation of the government's local sustainable transport fund and is expected to unlock additional local contributions of £2.7 million.

Norman Baker said:

> The scheme we are funding will improve life for people in Tyne and Wear and show that cutting carbon and boosting economic growth and opportunity can go hand in hand.
> 
> Our investment in this scheme shows that we are serious about funding infrastructure where there is a clear business case for doing so. The money we are putting into this project will unlock much greater economic benefits for communities as well as improving the environment - it is a win-win for Tyne and Wear.

The first allocations of Department for Transport support under the Local Sustainable Transport Fund were made in July 2011. Since then, the fund has provided schemes across English regions with a total of over £600m. All the schemes have also received significant contributions from local councils or the private sector.

These local schemes are bringing national benefits. In addition to supporting economic growth, while enabling and encouraging people to make more sustainable travel choices, the projects will reduce delays on the roads in urban areas, delays which cost the economy around £11 billion a year. They will also help tackle problems such as poor air quality and improved cycling and walking infrastructure will help to improve the health of the nation.

## Notes to editors

  1. Tyne and Wear Integrated Transport Authority (ITA) secured Local Sustainable Transport Funding of £4.904m in the first round of the fund in July 2011. A subsequent larger bid earlier this year did not secure funding but the ITA was invited to submit a revised proposal focusing on a specific geographic area. Today's announcement relates to this revised bid, which will receive £4.995 million from the Department for Transport.
  2. A full list of [schemes that have been funded by the LSTF](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process) will be published on the Department for Transport website.

The new service, which will operate on a line which has seen high growth levels, is being delivered thanks to an agreement between Southern Railway and the Department for Transport. The service will operate from Uckfield at 5.18am, arriving into London Bridge at 6.23am.

Southern is funding the new service in part from efficiencies it has delivered on its current franchise and the Department for Transport today formally agreed these savings can be used to provide the new service.

Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

> I am pleased to see the industry looking at solutions that deliver benefits to passengers.
> 
> Adding an additional service to this vital route will mean more seats for passengers, easing congestion and providing earlier travel to London.

Southern's Franchise Improvement Director David Scorey said:

> The Uckfield line has seen significant growth in recent years and we are pleased that we have been able to find a way to respond to the increasing need for extra capacity, particularly on the morning service.

The service will operate until the end of the Southern Franchise, at which point it may be operated by the successor franchise operator. The replacement Franchise specification is subject to a public consultation, which closed on 23 August 2012. Due to the general high level of interest in this particular consultation, DfT has agreed to accept responses to the TSGN consultation up to 1700 on Friday 14 September.

## Notes to editors

Q. Who is paying for the additional service?  
Southern has made efficiencies in delivering the committed obligations under the Franchise Agreement and this money along with a contribution from Southern will fund the additional service until the end of the Southern Franchise in July 2015.

Q. why can't Southern operate more trains on this route?  
This route is operated by diesel trains as part of the route between Uckfield and Hurst Green is not electrified. Southern has a limited number of diesel units that are dedicated to the services they operate on this route and the Ashford to Hasting route.

Q. What will happen when the Southern franchise ends?  
The replacement Franchise specification for the combined Thameslink, Southern, Great Northern Franchise is subject to a public consultation, closes on 23 August 2012. Due to the general high level of interest in this particular consultation, DfT has agreed to accept responses to the TSGN consultation up to 1700 on Friday 14 September.

Bidders for the new Franchise will be able to propose their own solutions for addressing longer term forecast demand, on the new franchise including the Uckfield and Hasting diesel routes in the longer term.

Q. Where will any additional Diesel trains come from in the future?  
There are a number of electrification schemes planned which should give bidders of new franchises the confidence to choose electric rolling stock which will mean diesel rolling stock will become available for alternative routes.

[Mr Baker partly approved proposals by London Midland to change the minimum opening hours at some ticket offices](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/london-midland-ticket-office-opening-hours-decision), but protected the interests of passengers.

He has secured a number of important passenger benefits including:

  * An extra 29 ticket vending machines at stations which do not currently have them allowing passengers to buy tickets around the clock;
  * Additional shelters on platforms and better signage;
  * More boarding ramps for wheelchair users and station lifts to be kept in operation at all times. Passengers who require assistance in making their journey will also be able to book this via a new industry website launched by ATOC last month.

Four of the nine ticket offices proposed for closure have been approved, while five others have been rejected. The ticket offices that will be allowed to close are Cheddington, Lye, Witton and Wythall. Adderley Park, Bescot Stadium, Duddeston, Jewellery Quarter and Small Heath will remain open.

Norman Baker said:

> These changes will better reflect the way passengers buy their tickets while improving satisfaction and efficiency.
> 
> I have protected passenger interests while allowing changes that provide savings to taxpayers and passengers far beyond the life of the existing franchise which will ultimately save millions of pounds.
> 
> For example, Lye station, near Stourbridge, is currently staffed Mon-Fri for nearly 18 hours (from 0552-2346). On average across the week, it sells less than 4 tickets per hour. It is for this reason that we are allowing London Midland to close this ticket office.

A number of ticket offices will be allowed to reduce their opening hours during very quiet periods, while several ticket offices at busy stations will have their minimum opening hours extended. A full list of the changes has been published on the department's website.

## Notes to editors

  1. The Ticketing and Settlement Agreement is the agreement between train operators that sets out the various arrangements between train operators relating to the carriage of passengers and the retailing of tickets. A copy of the latest version is available from the [ATOC website](http://www.atoc.org)
  2. The decision was referred to the Department for Transport to arbitrate under the existing rules of the Ticketing and Settlement Agreement.
  3. This decision is entirely separate from the recommendations made by Sir Roy McNulty, which recommended closure of ticket offices at a wider number of stations. The department is currently considering the recommendations of the McNulty report, and is looking at the issues in the context of a wider fares and ticketing review.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120918a,More local decisions for transport schemes,Transport Minister Norman Baker has confirmed that more decisions on major transport schemes will be taken at a local level.,"More of the decisions on the major transport schemes that have a significant impact on people's daily lives will be taken at a local level, Transport Minister Norman Baker has confirmed today.

A public consultation on the devolution of decision-making on major local schemes showed broad support for the proposals and the Department for Transport will now be going ahead with the plans outlined in the consultation.

Local major transport schemes have traditionally been individually approved and funded by government under a centralised bidding process. In the future funding will be allocated locally according to population, allowing priorities to be decided by newly established local transport bodies which will be made up of local transport authorities, local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) and others with a key interest.

Norman Baker said:

> We want decisions on new transport infrastructure to be made more efficiently, and at a more local level than has previously been the case.
> 
> While it is right for the government to look at the big picture and co-ordinate schemes with a national impact, there is no substitute for local knowledge. That is why we want to make sure that important decisions affecting the future of towns and cities across England are made by those who best understand the specific issues facing their communities.

Decisions on the use of the devolved funding will be made by local transport bodies which will be expected to demonstrate to local stakeholders and central government that the schemes they will carry forward provide good value for money. Detailed guidance on how to provide this assurance will be published by the Department for Transport in due course.

With the 'Wiggins Effect' putting more people on the road, staying safe is a priority.

A new THINK! campaign, 'THINK CYCLIST', calls on drivers and cyclists to stay safe this autumn by looking out for each other - pointing out that drivers and cyclists have more in common than is often realised. With 80% of cyclists holding a driving licence, and 1 in 5 drivers cycling at least once a month , they are often the same people.

The THINK CYCLIST poll has also showed that cyclists and drivers agree on how to stay safe on the road.

  * Looking twice for each other when turning or at junctions came out top for both as the precaution that would avoid the most collisions (41% of regular cyclists, and 35% of regular car drivers).
  * Both also agree on how to make things better, with 67% of cyclists and 59% of drivers saying that giving each other space on the road was in their top three ways of making cyclists and drivers more visible to road users.

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:

> We take the issue of cycle safety extremely seriously so we are launching 'THINK CYCLIST', a campaign aimed at both cyclists and drivers.
> 
> With interest in cycling heightened by Bradley Wiggins winning the Tour de France and our cyclists' extraordinary success at the Olympics and Paralympics too, we want to remind cyclists and drivers of the importance of looking out for each other to avoid accidents.
> 
> Many people cycle and drive and a new THINK! poll shows both road user groups agree that looking twice at junctions, as well as giving each other space on the road, are practical things that we can all do to help reduce the numbers of cyclists killed and seriously injured on our roads each year.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:

> The safety of London's road users is an absolute priority for me and improved cycle safety in particular is at the heart of all our work. So with ever more Londoners taking to the streets on two wheels, many inspired by our amazing summer of sport, the THINK CYCLIST campaign is a timely reminder of the need for road users to respect each other and make the city a safer place.

THINK CYCLIST is calling on drivers and cyclists to

  * Look out for each other, especially when turning
  * Signal intentions so that the other road user can react
  * Give cyclists space and remember that cyclists are advised to ride well clear of the kerb to be visible and avoid collisions

This is the first time that THINK! has targeted cyclists and drivers together, and the campaign has the support of organisations such as the RAC, AA and IAM The campaign will be working with motoring and cycling organisations nationally and locally to help to get safety messages to their members.

RAC technical director David Bizley said:

> RAC welcomes any measure which helps improve safety for all road users and clearly with the growing interest in cycling there is a need for greater prominence of cycle safety. Many of our members are cyclists as well as drivers and we are keen to see greater awareness of the needs and risks presented by modern road use to, potentially, vulnerable cyclists.

AA President Edmund King said:

> There are too many accidents between cars and cyclists. We need to look for each other whether opening a car door or changing lanes. As fuel prices rise and fitness moves higher up the agenda there will be more cyclists. Drivers need to think more about cyclists on the road.

Chief executive of the IAM Simon Best said:

> Whether you're on two wheels or four, you are responsible for the safety of others. All accidents are preventable. By being considerate and eradicating bad habits we can significantly reduce accidents.

  3. THINK CYCLIST advice:  
When you're driving 
    1. Look out for cyclists, especially when turning - make eye contact if possible so they know you've seen them
    2. Use your indicators - signal your intentions so that cyclists can react
    3. Give cyclists space - at least half a car's width. If there isn't sufficient space to pass, hold back. Remember that cyclists may need to manoeuvre suddenly if the road is poor, it's windy or if a car door is opened.
    4. Always check for cyclists when you open your car door
    5. Avoid driving over advance stop lines - these allow cyclists to get to the front and increase their visibility
    6. Follow the Highway Code including 'stop' and 'give way' signs and traffic lights

When you're cycling

    1. Ride positively, decisively and well clear of the kerb - look and signal to show drivers what you plan to do and make eye contact where possible so you know drivers have seen you.
    2. Avoid riding up the inside of large vehicles, like lorries or buses, where you might not be seen
    3. Always use lights after dark or when visibility is poor
    4. Wearing light coloured or reflective clothing during the day and reflective clothing and/or accessories in the dark increases your visibility
    5. Follow the Highway Code including observing 'stop' and 'give way' signs and traffic lights
  4. THINK! recommends wearing a correctly fitted cycle helmet, which is securely fastened and conforms to current regulations
  5. All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 2117 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 21st - 23th August 2012. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all UK adults (aged 18+).

Designation of the line between Exeter St David's and Exmouth will enable train companies to work more closely with the Avocet Line Rail Users Group and the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership to better design services to meet local needs.

Community Rail Minister Norman Baker said:

> I want to encourage communities to become more closely involved with their railways to help create the services and stations passengers deserve.
> 
> That is why I am delighted to announce this latest community rail service designation and to be able to do so on the day of the National Community Rail Awards. Today's designation is a major step towards helping the Avocet Line Rail Users Group and the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership work closely with local groups to provide innovative and more cost effective rail services for their community.

Mark Hopwood, Managing Director of First Great Western, which runs services on the line, said:

> At First Great Western we're committed supporters of community rail and fully endorse the benefits that working closely with our local partners can bring. We very much welcome the designation of the Avocet Line which will enable it to take full advantage of the benefits that are available to all our other thriving community rail branch lines.

Tony Day, Chairman of the Avocet Line Rail Users Group said:

> Last year, when we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the opening of the railway to Exmouth, people from the communities along it showed their enormous support for the Avocet Line. They will depend on it more and more in future years, as new housing in Exmouth and the east of Exeter adds passengers to this already busy commuter railway. I look forward to the involvement of those communities in shaping the line's development.

Richard Burningham, Manager of the Devon & Cornwall Rail Partnership said:

> It is great to welcome the busy Avocet Line to the community rail family. This designation will help us, the Avocet Line Rail Users Group, Devon County Council and others work together more closely still to further develop and improve the line and its service in partnership with the rail industry.

## Notes to editors

  1. The Community Rail Development Strategy looks at innovative ways of operating local branch lines, through a programme of cost management, a drive to increase passenger numbers and direct community involvement via local authorities, community rail partnerships and other stakeholder groups.
  2. To date, 18 lines with their services have been designated as community rail lines: 
    * St Ives Bay Line: St Erth to St Ives June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Abbey Line: St Albans Abbey to Watford Junction June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Esk Valley Line: Middlesbrough to Whitby June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot lines.
    * Tamar Valley Line: Plymouth to Gunnislake September 2005. Linked with Looe Valley as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Looe Valley Line: Liskeard to Looe September 2005. Linked with Tamar Valley as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Penistone Line: Barnsley to Huddersfield September 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Island Line: Isle of Wight (Ryde to Shanklin) March 2006.
    * Tarka Line: Barnstaple to Cowley Junction Exeter September 2006.

    * Lymington Line: Brockenhurst - Lymington July 2008.
    * Preston to Ormskirk Line: Preston to Ormskirk September 2011.
  3. Additionally, 14 services have been designated as community rail services whilst not designating the lines on which they run. These services are designated when there are reasons why the infrastructure cannot be included in the designation - because it carries non local traffic or heavy freight or has previously been designated as part of the Trans European Network. To date the following services have been designated: 
    * Poacher Line: Grantham to Skegness July 2006. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120928b,Greater rights for motorists,From October 1 2012 motorists will be given greater rights as new laws banning wheel clamping and towing take effect.,"From Monday (October 1) motorists will be given greater rights as new laws banning wheel clamping and towing take effect.

It will be an offence to clamp, tow, block-in or immobilise a vehicle without lawful authority on private land under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. These changes will end abuses by rogue clamping firms who prey on motorists by charging excessive release fees. If clampers break the law, they could be liable to an unlimited fine in the Crown Court or up to £5,000 in a Magistrates Court.

Lord Taylor of Holbeach, the Home Office Minister with responsibility for changes to vehicle clamping law, said:

> This common sense ban will give motorists the protection they deserve against rogue wheel-clamping and towing companies.
> 
> It will save motorists £55 million each year in clamping charges and finally penalise the real criminals - the corrupt firms themselves.

Other changes to vehicle laws include extending police powers to remove vehicles parked on private land. This will ensure landowners have a means to keep their land clear from obstructive or dangerously parked cars.

The Department for Transport is also strengthening laws around ticketing, so unpaid charges can be claimed from the keeper of the vehicle, as well as the driver. The government has also agreed that an Independent Appeals Service funded by the British Parking Association will be established from 1 October. This free service will allow motorists to appeal a parking charge issued on private land by a company that is a member of the BPA's Approved Operator Scheme.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

> These new parking arrangements deliver a fairer legal framework for motorists and landowners, while getting rid of the indiscriminate clamping and towing by private companies for good.

These changes are being introduced on Monday as part of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, which received Royal Assent in May this year. They were all raised by members of the public through a cross-government survey, 'Your Freedom'. People had the chance to suggest ideas on restoring liberties that have been lost, repealing unnecessary laws and stripping away excessive regulation. The Act aims to restore traditional British freedoms to the heart of the Whitehall agenda.

## Notes to editors

Home Office: Wheel clamping ban

  1. Evidence collated by the government showed that around 500,000 clampings were taking place annually on private land with an average release fee of £112 and almost all clamp fees were paid.
  2. The ban will not change existing lawful authority, such as traffic enforcement by local authorities and police on highways, but will effectively ban clamping on private land.
  3. The ban also applies to towing away and blocking in. Anyone who clamps a vehicle or tows it away on private land without specific lawful authority to do so may face criminal proceedings.
  4. Lawful authority to clamp or tow vehicles will remain for various organisations and public bodies. For example, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) will retain the legal authority to clamp or tow away vehicles as part of its work in combating evasion of Vehicle Excise Duty. The Vehicle and Operator Services Authority has similar powers to prevent the use of un-roadworthy vehicles on the road. Others include airports, ports, as well as some railway stations and common land.

Extension of police powers to move vehicles parked dangerously on private land

  5. The extension of police powers will not constitute a duty on the police to remove vehicles. It is expected that police forces will respond in light of the circumstances of the incident and available resources.
  6. The government set up the Your Freedom website to allow members of the public to suggest unnecessary laws which should be repealed. There was a commitment to take views expressed into account when considering the scope of the Protection of Freedoms Bill. The removal of restrictions on time for civil partnership and marriage ceremonies was considered an appropriate repeal to include within the Bill, which received Royal Assent in May 2012.
  7. For more information, contact the Home Office press office on 020 7035 3535.

Department for Transport measures

  8. The Government is strengthening the enforcement arrangements for ticketing in private car parks, by allowing landowners to reclaim unpaid parking charges from the keeper of a vehicle if the driver is not known and the keeper refuses to say who the driver is.
  9. [Guidance on the new provisions is available](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/guidance-unpaid-parking-charges/) .
  10. As part of this change from October 1st 2012, car parking operators who are members of the British Parking Association's Approved Operator Scheme (AOS), will be required to offer motorists a new independent appeals service called 'Parking on Private Land Appeals' (POPLA).
  11. POPLA will be provided as a free service to motorists and will be operated by London Councils who also run the appeals service for Transport for London and London Borough Council issued tickets. Its decisions will be binding on parking operators, but not on motorists.
  12. The Independent Appeals Service will be able to consider whether car park operators are providing motorists with adequate signs, which clearly lay out the terms and conditions of parking. They will also consider whether parking charges are reasonable under relevant contract and consumer protection legislation.
  13. Car parks managed by operators who are not members of an Accredited Trade Association and are therefore not able to request registered keeper details from DVLA, will not be covered by POPLA.
  14. For more information on these areas, call the Department for Transport on 020 7944 3066.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20121001a,Better protection for UK holidaymakers,Aviation Minister Simon Burns has announced new rules to better protect holidaymakers from losing out if their travel company fails.,"Aviation Minister Simon Burns has announced new rules coming into force today to better protect holidaymakers from losing out if their travel company fails.

Anyone who books an ATOL protected holiday or flight will immediately get an ATOL certificate confirming the details of the booking and their level of protection. It is designed to make clear to UK holidaymakers in a simple, straightforward way how their holiday is financially protected.

With holidays protected by the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing(ATOL) scheme passengers get either a full refund or repatriation if they are already abroad when their holiday company becomes insolvent.

Simon Burns said:

> The internet has made booking a holiday easier but that can lead to a lack of clarity on the important matter of what happens if the holiday company runs into trouble.
> 
> The ATOL Certificate will give peace of mind to millions when booking their holiday. Whether on a computer, the phone or in a travel agent, holidaymakers will not only complete their booking but also receive a certificate removing any doubt over their level of cover.
> 
> I want this certificate to become a standard travel document that families will expect alongside their flight tickets and holiday details.

Dame Deirdre Hutton, Chair of the Civil Aviation Authority, said:

> It's been clear for some time that people are confused about holiday financial protection, and consumers have told us that they want more clarity about how their holidays are protected. The introduction of the ATOL Certificate will mean that people can clearly see on one standard document what is protected, who is protecting it and what they should do if their company fails.
> 
> It's a change in the scheme that will make simple what currently can seem very complex: with the certificate consumers have protection, without it they do not.

The ATOL Certificate is the final stage of reforms introduced on 30th April to modernise the scheme, including bringing Flight Plus holidays into the ATOL scheme and returning it to financial self-sustainability.

The Civil Aviation Bill currently going through Parliament includes a clause which could enable the Transport Secretary to make further changes to the ATOL scheme in future. This could mean holidays sold by airlines and holidays arranged on an 'agent for the consumer' basis being brought into the scheme.

## Notes to editors

  1. The ATOL scheme is administered by the Civil Aviation Authority and ensures passengers who have not already travelled receive a full refund or are brought home free of charge if abroad at the time of insolvency.
  2. The ATOL Certificate is a standard document issued by anyone selling an ATOL-protected holiday, which makes clear how the trip is protected and by whom.
  3. An estimated 38.3 million people flew abroad on leisure trips in 2011. In the year to 31 March 2012 there were 17.3m ATOL protected holidays and flights, and nearly 82,000 holidaymakers were repatriated or received full refunds when their ATOL tour operator went bust.
  4. Most businesses selling package holidays including a flight have to have an ATOL licence issued by the CAA. Businesses pay £2.50 for each booking into the Air Travel Trust Fund that meets the costs of refunds and repatriations.
  5. The ATOL scheme was first put in place on a statutory basis in the early 1970s. It was last substantially overhauled in 1995.
  6. Airlines are legally exempt from the requirement to hold an ATOL licence, however, any package holidays they sell must still be financially protected, under the Package Travel Regulations. A number of UK airlines have subsequently set up subsidiary companies to sell package holidays that do have an ATOL licence.
  7. Further details on the Civil Aviation Bill which is currently proceeding through Parliament are [available on the Department for Transport website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/legislation/civil-aviation-bill).
  8. On 30 April 2012, changes were put in place to improve the clarity of the ATOL scheme's coverage by including in it Flight-Plus holidays. This should also help the schemes' finances to return to a secure self-sustaining footing. Following a series of high-profile insolvencies in recent years, the Air Travel Trust Fund is currently running at a deficit, supported by a government-backed guarantee. It is hoped the new rules will eliminate this within three years, reducing the risk to the taxpayer.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20121003a,West Coast Main Line franchise competition cancelled,Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has announced that the competition to run trains on the West Coast Main Line has been cancelled.,"Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has today announced that the competition to run trains on the West Coast Main Line has been cancelled following the discovery of significant technical flaws in the way the franchise process was conducted.

The decision means that the Department for Transport (DfT) will no longer be awarding a franchise contract to run the West Coast service when the current franchise expires on December 9. It is consequently no longer contesting the judicial review sought by Virgin Trains Ltd in the High Court.

The flaws uncovered relate to the way the procurement was conducted by department officials. An announcement will be made later today concerning the suspension of staff while an investigation takes place.

The government is resolving urgently the future arrangements for operation of the West Coast and will ensure that train services continue uninterrupted. Mr McLoughlin stressed today that passengers will continue to be served by the same trains and frontline staff.

The Transport Secretary has also:

  * ordered two independent reviews to be undertaken urgently: the first into what went wrong with the West Coast competition and the lessons to be learned, the second into the wider DfT rail franchise programme, both overseen by leading business figures;
  * asked officials to examine the options for the operation of the West Coast service after December 9, taking into account procurement and competition law;
  * paused all the other outstanding franchise competitions (Great Western, Essex Thameside and Thameslink) pending the independent reviews which are designed to ensure future competitions are robust and deliver best value for passengers and tax payers.

Mr McLoughlin said:

> I have had to cancel the competition for the running of the West Coast franchise because of deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable mistakes made by my department in the way it managed the process.
> A detailed examination by my officials into what happened has revealed these flaws and means it is no longer possible to award a new franchise on the basis of the competition that was held.
> I have ordered two independent reviews to look urgently and thoroughly into the matter so that we know what exactly happened and how we can make sure our rail franchise programme is fit for purpose.

He added:

> West Coast passengers can rest assured that while we seek urgently to resolve the future arrangements the trains that run now will continue to run, with the same drivers, the same staff and timetables as planned. The tickets that people have booked will continue to be valid and passengers will be able to make their journeys as planned.

DfT permanent secretary Philip Rutnam said:

> The errors exposed by our investigation are deeply concerning. They show a lack of good process and a lack of proper quality assurance.
> 
> I am determined to identify exactly what went wrong and why, and to put these things right so that we never find ourselves in this position again.

The first independent review will be an urgent independent examination into the lessons to be learned from the department's handling of this competition. Conducted by independent advisers and overseen by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw and former PricewaterhouseCoopers strategy chairman Ed Smith, both DfT non-executive directors, this review will look as soon as possible at what happened and why with a view to delivering an initial report by the end of October.

The second independent review will be undertaken by Eurostar chairman Richard Brown CBE, and examine the wider rail franchising programme. It will look in detail at whether changes are needed to the way risk is assessed and to the bidding and evaluation processes, and at how to get the other franchise competitions back on track as soon as possible. This will report back by the end of December.

Evidence of significant flaws in the department's approach emerged while officials were undertaking very detailed evidence-gathering in preparation for legal proceedings in the High Court.

These flaws stem from the way the level of risk in the bids was evaluated. Mistakes were made in the way in which inflation and passenger numbers were taken into account, and how much money bidders were then asked to guarantee as a result.

The department cannot be confident that these flaws would not have changed the outcome of the competition or that any of the four bidders would not have chosen to submit different offers.

The DfT has spoken to the four bidding companies to inform them of the flaws that the department discovered. The DfT will reimburse their bid costs and has assured them that a fresh competition will be started as soon as the lessons of this episode are learned.

Designation of the line between Leeds to Morecambe will enable train companies to work more closely with the Leeds, Lancaster and Morecambe Community Rail Partnership to better design services to meet local needs.

Community Rail Minister Norman Baker said:

> I want to encourage communities to become more closely involved with their railways to help create the services and stations passengers deserve.
> 
> That's why I am delighted to announce this latest community rail service designation. Today's designation is a major step towards helping the Leeds, Lancaster and Morecambe Community Rail Partnership work closely with local groups to provide innovative and more cost effective rail services for their community.

Ian Bevan, Managing Director of Northern Rail, which runs services on the route, said:

> The designation of the Bentham Line is fantastic news for the local community. As this route is integral to the area, its designation ensures it will be developed to benefit local people and visitors to the region. We look forward to working with the community rail partnership to enable the route to prosper as much as possible.

Councillor Richard Rollins, Chairman of the Leeds, Lancaster and Morecambe Community Rail Partnership said:

> This is excellent news. Designation will enable the Community Rail Partnership to work in partnership with the local community to make significant developments along the line. Key objectives include station improvements and service developments.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20121025a,Government unveils generous HS2 compensation package,Residents affected by the first phase of HS2 from London to the West Midlands will be offered compensation measures which go beyond statutory requirements.,"Residents affected by the first phase of HS2 from London to the West Midlands will be offered a comprehensive package of compensation measures which go significantly beyond statutory requirements, the government confirmed today.

HS2, a national high-speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds with London and Heathrow, will transform the UK - bringing cities together, delivering jobs and growth, and providing a long-term solution to the capacity crunch facing the existing rail network. Stations will also be situated in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire, while high speed trains will continue on the existing rail network to serve destinations further north and into Scotland. The government has already consulted on the route of the first phase of the project to the West Midlands and the Transport Secretary will publish his preferred routes for the second phase of the scheme later this year.

However, the government recognises the impact the project is having on property markets along the first phase of the route and, after careful consideration, has decided to go above and beyond what is required by law.

The measures proposed today go beyond the statutory requirements by:

  * providing a government commitment to buy any owner-occupied home in the 'safeguarded area' closest to the route. As set out in law, the government will then pay the full un-blighted value of the property, along with additional compensation of 10 per cent up to a value of £47,000;
  * establishing a 'voluntary purchase zone' immediately outside of the safeguarded area in rural areas, within which homeowners can sell their homes at their full un-blighted value; 
  * a long term hardship scheme to help those with a need to move during the development of HS2 but who are unable to sell their home; 
  * a sale and rent back scheme to give more flexibility to homeowners who wish to stay in properties which will ultimately be required to allow for construction work;
  * a package of measures to provide clarity and reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels, including before and after surveys;
  * a commitment to work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to develop a strategy for replacing any lost social rented housing.

Rail minister Simon Burns said:

> HS2 will completely transform the UK. It will define our country, not just for the 21st century but beyond - linking our major cities in a way previous generations could only dream of.
> 
> No major infrastructure project on this scale can be built without some impact on local communities, but I am determined to do everything I can to minimise the effect of HS2 on those closest to the line.
> 
> We have developed the right compensation package, providing absolutely the right support for those affected, while at the same time protecting the interests of taxpayers. We have thought long and hard about this and the measures I have announced are fair and strike the right balance for local communities and the British taxpayer.

The compensation package announced today is comparable with the arrangements put in place for homeowners affected by the construction of HS1. It will now be subject to a period of consultation until 31st January 2013.

Alongside the proposed compensation package, HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport has also launched a three-month consultation aimed at local authorities on safeguarding the land needed in order to build and run the line between London and the West Midlands. Safeguarding is the technical term for the planning mechanism that protects large-scale public infrastructure projects from conflicting developments nearby.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The consultation document [High Speed Two: Property and Compensation for London - West Midlands](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/property-compensation-london-to-west-midlands) closes on 31st January 2013: 

Consultation events for the property compensation consultation will take place along the line of route.

Further information is available on the [high speed rail consultation website](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/) or by contacting the HS2 enquiries line on: 0207 944 4908.

### Safeguarding Consultation

  2. The consultation document [High Speed Two: Safeguarding for London - West Midlands](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/safeguarding) is available and closes on 31st January 2013: 

This consultation is aimed at planning authorities. An email is being sent to local authorities, community forums and MPs inviting them to participate.

  3. Further details on the compensation measures published today: 

Streamlined system of advanced purchase within the safeguarded zone

Under these measures, owner-occupiers of residential properties and owners of commercial properties (with a rateable value not exceeding £34,800) where some or all of the property is within the safeguarded area (usually 60 metres either side of the track) will be able to ask the government to purchase their property under compulsory terms at a time of their choosing after safeguarding directions are made (expected Spring 2013). This means they will receive the unblighted open market value of the property, a home loss payment (10% of the value of the property, up to £47,000) and disturbance costs (such as fees, removal costs and stamp duty on a new property of equivalent value).

The government proposes that where the entirety of an eligible property is within the safeguarded area and the owner asks the government to purchase their property we will agree, whether it is actually required for the railway or not. We will also consider purchase requests where only part of a property is within the safeguarded zone.

Streamlined system for voluntary purchase within a new voluntary purchase zone in rural areas

The government will also establish a new voluntary purchase zone outside of the immediate safeguarded zone within which owner-occupiers of residential property or owners of commercial property (with a rateable value not exceeding £34,800) will be also able to ask the government to purchase their property for its unblighted open market value.

As the impact of HS2 on the property market has been and is expected to continue to be greater in rural areas than in urban areas the Voluntary Purchase Zone will run from the M25 northwards to the south of the delta junction to Birmingham and to the north of the delta junction with the junction with the West Coast Main Line. The voluntary purchase zone will cover an area 120m either side of the line of route, except over bored tunnels.

A hardship scheme for those beyond the safeguarded and voluntary purchase zones

Those with a need to move during the development of HS2 but who are unable to sell their home despite being outside both the safeguarded area and the voluntary purchase zone will be able to apply to have the government purchase their homes under a hardship scheme.

A sale and rent back scheme

This will allow homeowners whose property will need to be demolished to sell their property to the government when they wish but remain in their homes as tenants until their land is actually needed for construction.

A series of measures designed to provide peace of mind for property owners above tunnels

In the interests of transparency, Mr McLoughlin has today published that report, alongside a covering letter, and this afternoon delivered an update to Parliament about this report and wider progress on ensuring continuity of service on the West Coast Main Line.

Sam Laidlaw, the senior business figure and DfT non-executive director leading this independent review, has asked the DfT to release the following statement on behalf of his inquiry:

> In the limited time available this is necessarily only a preliminary report. What is clear however is that in seeking to run a complex and novel franchising competition process, an accumulation of significant errors, described in the report, resulted in a flawed process.
> 
> These errors appear to have been caused by factors including inadequate planning and preparation, a complex organisational structure and a weak governance and quality assurance framework. The full causes and the lessons to be learnt will be addressed in the final report of my independent Inquiry to be published at the end of November.
> 
> Firm judgments should not be made based upon what are provisional findings or wider conclusions drawn at this stage.

10 September 2012 marks four years since the introduction of the Driver CPC for bus and coach drivers, and three years since its introduction for lorry drivers. Under Driver CPC, professional bus, coach and lorry drivers have to complete 35 hours of accredited training every five years. 

Drivers who acquired their vocational licence before the introduction of Driver CPC have five years from its introduction to complete the required 35 hours. This means the deadline for bus and coach drivers is September 2013, and for lorry drivers it is September 2014.

Since Driver CPC was introduced over half a million professional drivers across the goods and passenger sectors have undertaken accredited periodic training, further developing their knowledge and skills and helping to ensure they remain safe and responsible drivers throughout their careers.

DSA chief executive, Rosemary Thew, said:

> I would urge all drivers who haven't yet started periodic training not to leave it until the last minute. If the deadline arrives and you drive professionally without a Driver CPC, you'll be committing an offence. 
> 
> If you're an operator and you cause or allow your drivers to drive without Driver CPC - you'll also be committing an offence. 
> 
> The idea of drivers completing regular training throughout their working life is not new - many have been doing it for years through operators who recognise the benefits of drivers developing their skills; helping to boost productivity as well as improve road safety.

There are now over 3,000 approved training courses available to drivers, covering a whole range of topics from fuel efficiency to tachograph and drivers' hours regulations or defensive driving. All courses and providers have to meet strict criteria and are subject to ongoing quality assurance to ensure they meet the required standard. [Courses can be found on the Directgov website](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/Drivingforaliving/Drivinglorriesbusesandcoaches/DG_186131).

The DSA worked with the haulage and passenger transport industries to develop these and they address specific issues such as the use of tachographs and the dangers of continuous driving.

The National Driving Standard Category C™ (lorry) and National Driving Standard Category D™ (bus and coach) outline what drivers need to know, understand and be able to do in areas such as:

  * preparing a vehicle and its occupants for a journey
  * guiding and controlling a vehicle
  * using the road in accordance with the Highway Code
  * driving safely and responsibly in the traffic system
  * reviewing and adjusting driver behaviour over a lifetime

DSA chief executive, Rosemary Thew, said: 

> The haulage and passenger transport industries are a vital part of Britain's economy and have an important role to play in keeping our roads among the safest in the world. 
> 
> The publication of these Standards will help to ensure that all bus and lorry drivers acquire the right skills, knowledge and attitude to use our roads safely and responsibly, as well as contributing to cutting the human and financial cost of road accidents.
> 
> I want to thank the haulage and passenger transport industries and the sector skills councils for their input into the development of the Standards. These will enhance the excellent training that is already available and contribute to the work the DSA is doing to set standards for everyone who uses a motorised vehicle on the public roads.

The Standards should form the basis of training that a lorry, bus or coach driver receives - and so the training industry is encouraged to create courses that address them. This includes both the training that drivers complete to professionally (Driver CPC) and training for those who don't drive for a living. 

The Standards build on National Driving Standard Category B™ that defines safe and responsible driving for car and light van drivers. They are based on evidence, open to challenge and regularly reviewed to ensure they are relevant and up to date.

The publication of the Standards fulfils the commitment made in the Government's Strategic Framework for Road Safety to extend the standards framework to cover categories C and D.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/press-dft-20121007a,Reduced cap on rail fare rises,Passengers will benefit from a cut of up to 2% to the planned rises in the cost of nationwide train travel and travel on London buses and tubes.,"Passengers will benefit from a cut of up to 2% to the planned rises in the cost of nationwide train travel and travel on London buses and tubes following today's announcement by Prime Minister David Cameron.

The average increase in regulated rail fares and the cost of travel on London's buses and tube network will be limited to one per cent above inflation for 2013 and 2014. Rail fares had been due to increase by RPI+3%, while fares on London buses and tubes had been due to rise by RPI+2% in 2013.

This is expected to benefit more than a quarter of a million annual season ticket holders who can expect to have an extra £45 back in their pockets as a result of today's decision. Many more holders of weekly and monthly season tickets could also see lower fares and some commuters will be over £200 better off over the two years.

The Department for Transport (DfT) is planning that from January 2015 onwards the regulated fares cap for franchised train operators will increase by RPI+1%.

The decision to reduce the planned increases, funded from savings identified in the DfT's budget, will benefit hard-pressed commuters and passengers. In future years the DfT will look to absorb the costs by reprioritising within existing budgets.

The fares national rail passengers pay will continue to support our major programme of rail improvements, the largest in scale since the Victorian era. It will deliver crucial benefits for passengers, including relief from crowding on some of the nation's busiest routes.

The government still believes it is vital that efficiencies are found in the cost of running the railways so that we can deliver better value for money for both taxpayers and farepayers and end the era of above-inflation rises.

## Notes to editors

  * The 2010 Spending Review announced that the cap on average regulated rail fares increase would be the RPI rate of inflation plus 3 per cent in 2012, 2013 and 2014. In the Autumn Statement last year, the government lowered the cap on increases to RPI+1 per cent for 2012.
  * The July RPI used in the calculation of rail fares is 3.2%. So from January 2013 the average rise in regulated rail fares will be 4.2%.
  * The independent McNulty Rail Value for Money study published in 2011 highlighted that while our railways are performing well operationally, they cost too much to run. If we can make substantial reductions to the cost of running the railways and the improvement in the wider economic situation permits, we can bring to an end the era of above inflation fare rises in average regulated fares, while continuing to expand capacity on our rail network.
  * The Government regulates the existence and price of certain rail fares: generally, commuter fares and the majority of long-distance off-peak fares.

The £170 million investment is part of a £217 million programme to remove bottlenecks and keep traffic moving on England's motorways and major A roads. The economic benefit of these 57 schemes is estimated at around £3 billion.

Many of the improvements will be delivered in 2013 and 2014, and they will all be completed by March 2015. Today's announcement brings the total number of schemes to receive investment from the government's pinch point fund to 65. A third stage of projects will be announced next year.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said:

> These £217 million road improvements prove the government's determination to accelerate growth and cut congestion.
> 
> Keeping traffic moving is vital to securing prosperity. By removing bottlenecks and improving access to local enterprise zones, key international trading ports and communities, these road schemes will help get people to and from work and power the economy. They also have the potential to help deliver more than 300,000 new jobs and 150,000 new homes.

The improvements include an £11 million scheme to widen and improve junction 4 of the M5 near Bromsgrove, with significant benefits for Longbridge, former home of the MG Rover manufacturing plant. It will support a local authority and local enterprise partnership development plan that aims to create around 10,000 jobs and 3,000 homes in the region.

At junction 5 of the M27, near Eastleigh, a £4.9 million scheme will reduce congestion by widening approach roads and slips roads and providing a segregated left turn lane onto the M27 eastbound. This supports several local development plans, including Solent Enterprise Zone, Eastleigh Riverside, Southampton Airport and Southampton City Centre, with the potential to create around 12,000 jobs and 7,000 homes.

These improvement schemes form part of the government's growth initiative outlined during the Chancellor's Autumn Statement in November 2011. Funds have been allocated to the Highways Agency to undertake focused improvements to the strategic road network.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/press-dft-20121015a,Department for Transport to negotiate with Virgin on temporary operation of West Coast rail services,Virgin to remain as operator while a competition is run for an interim franchise agreement.,"The Department for Transport will negotiate with Virgin Rail Group for them to continue providing rail services on the West Coast Main Line for a temporary period.

The current franchise is due to expire on 9 December after which it is the government's intention that Virgin remain as operator for a short period - expected to be between 9 and 13 months - while a competition is run for an interim franchise agreement. This interim agreement, which would be open to any bidders, will then run until the new long term West Coast franchise is ready to commence.

The government believes that this is the best way to ensure services are maintained and that there is no impact on passengers.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said:

> The cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise is deeply regrettable and I apologise to the bidders involved and the taxpayer who have a right to expect better.
> 
> My priority now is to fix the problem and the first step is to take urgent action to ensure that on the 9 December services continue to run to the same standard and passengers are not affected.
> 
> I believe Virgin remaining as operator for a short period of time is the best way to do this and my officials and I will be working flat out to make this happen.

On 3 October the previous competition to run trains on this line was cancelled following the discovery of significant technical flaws in the way the franchise process was conducted.

The department also paused the on-going franchise programme including live competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western and Thameslink and set up two independent reviews into what went wrong with the West Coast competition and the wider DfT rail franchise programme.

## Notes to editors

  1. The Transport Secretary has ordered two independent reviews:
  2. The [first will be an urgent independent examination into the lessons to be learned from the department's handling of West Coast competition](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/sam-laidlaw-20121015b/). Conducted by independent advisers and overseen by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw and former PricewaterhouseCoopers strategy chairman Ed Smith, both Department for Transport non-executive directors, this review will look as soon as possible at what happened and why with a view to delivering an initial report by the end of October.
  3. The [second independent review will be undertaken by Eurostar chairman Richard Brown CBE](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/richard-brown-20121015a/), and examine the wider rail franchising programme. It will look in detail at whether changes are needed to the way risk is assessed and to the bidding and evaluation processes, and at how to get the other franchise competitions back on track as soon as possible. This will report back by the end of December.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dft-news-20120913a,Consultation on bus subsidy reform,A consultation on bus subsidy reform has been launched and will run for eight weeks.,"In March, the government published 'Green light for better buses', in which we set out our plans for improving local bus subsidy arrangements and regulations in England outside London. At that time we undertook to consult on these proposals and today we have published that consultation.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

> Buses are the mainstay of our public transport system and can help to cut carbon and congestion. We want to take a fresh look at the way we fund buses so that more decisions affecting local services are being taken at a local level by people who know most about the needs of their communities.
> 
> That is why we are today launching a consultation on how best to implement the changes to the Bus Service Operators Grant system which we announced in March and ensure that funding is fair and fit for the future.
> 
> I hope that those parties with views and experience to share will find the time to read our proposals and have their say on how these changes should be made.

Following the March announcement the Department for Transport set up working groups including local authorities and bus company representatives to look at the fine details of how these changes would work. This work has fed into the proposals which we are consulting on now. The consultation will run for eight weeks and can be found on the [department's website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-39/).

The DSA's chief executive Rosemary Thew said: 

> Not all examiners are members of the PCS union and even if they are, we can't be sure that they'll support the strike. So we're asking candidates to come for their test as normal so it can go ahead if possible. 
> 
> We're sorry for the inconvenience this will cause and will do everything we can to minimise disruption for our customers.

Candidates who turn up but can't take their tests because of strike action will not have to contact the DSA to rebook. They should hear from the agency with a new date within 5 to 10 working days.

## Out-of-pocket expenses

If candidates fail to attend they won't be able to claim out-of-pocket expenses if their tests are cancelled and they'll need to rebook their own tests.

Details about claiming out-of-pocket expenses can be found at [direct.gov.uk/drivingtestexpenses.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/drivingtestexpenses)

## Customer service centre

The DSA's customer service centre for practical tests might also be affected by strike action on Friday 21 September. Instructors, trainers and candidates will still be able to book, change or cancel practical tests online at [direct.gov.uk/drivingtest.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/drivingtest)
