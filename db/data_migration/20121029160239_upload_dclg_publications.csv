http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/localgovernmentsavings201011,Local government contribution to efficiencies in 2010-11,Local government contribution to efficiencies in 2010 to 2011,,"The Government has published details of the Â£1.166bn Local Government contribution to the Â£6.2bn cross government savings in 2010/11 needed to tackle the UK's record deficit in order to restore confidence in the economy and support the recovery.

The information listed in the documents and tables below set out the basis on which the Government will implement reductions to individual local authority grant allocations, as announced in a Written Ministerial Statement made by the Secretary of Statement on Thursday 10 June 2010.

The Government recognises that it will be challenging for local authorities (along with other parts of the public sector) to make these reductions in-year. However, the Government is clear that these reductions are necessary for the reasons set out above. The Government believes that it is for local authorities to decide where their priorities and opportunities for efficiencies lie across the totality of their responsibilities.

To support local authorities to re-shape their budgets, the Government aims to give authorities certainty about their grant reductions as a matter of urgency, so that they can make the necessary decisions as quickly as possible.

HM Treasury (HMT) requires that all central government departments should publish details of their April - September 2010 spending for transactions over Â£25,000 by the end of October 2010, and thereafter publish monthly data by the 15th working day of each month.

Local Authorities will follow a similar process but will be required to publish expenditure over the lower Â£500 threshold from January 2011.

The Department's arm's length bodies will each be responsible for publishing their own spending data, both on their own websites and on Data.gov, and will publish April - September 2010 spending data at the end of October 2010, in line with other government departments.

In the light of changing shopping habits, high streets need to evolve to ensure they build on their strengths to offer a viable and exciting alternative to out of town and internet shopping.

Town centres and high streets have buildings and roads, but the spaces in-between are what hold them together as a place - the open spaces, squares, urban green spaces and the network of streets, pavements and pedestrian thoroughfares that knit them together. All too often, these spaces are used as no more than that - thoroughfares - and we start to forget that they can be so much more.

_Re-imagining urban spaces to help revitalise our high streets_ describes the many different ways in which these under-utilised assets can be used imaginatively to revitalise high streets and town centres - increasing high street vitality, attracting footfall and boosting local economies.

  * enabling social landlords to make best use of social housing by providing greater freedom to set the terms tenancies and succession rights for new social tenants
  * Increase mobility by requiring social landlords to participate in 'home swap' (mutual exchange) schemes through which tenants can search all records of potential partners

The consultation on the proposed statement ended on 22 April 2012. As a result, the policy statement has been revised and is now available in final form.

The Localism Act provides a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central government and towards local people. The government has given public authorities more powers and freedoms to conduct their business and deliver services to the public.

This Statistical Release presents National Statistics on the projected number of households in England and its regions to 2033. The figures in this release are based on the 2008-based population projections and replace the 2006-based household projections released in March 2009.

The household projections are produced by applying projected household formation rates to the population projections published by the Office for National Statistics. The assumptions underlying national household and population projections are demographic trend based.

They do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors might have on demographic behaviour. They provide the household levels and structures that would result if the assumptions based on previous demographic trends in the population and household formation rates were to be realised in practice.

Key points from the latest release are:

  * The number of households in England is projected to grow to 27.5 million in 2033, an increase of 5.8 million (27 per cent) over 2008, or 232,000 households per year.
  * Population growth is the main driver of household growth, accounting for nearly three-quarters of the increase in households between 2008 and 2033.
  * One person households are projected to increase by 159,000 per year, equating to two-thirds of the increase in households.
  * By 2033, 19 per cent of the household population of England is projected to live alone, compared with 14 per cent in 2008.
  * By 2033, 33 per cent of households will be headed by those aged 65 or over, up from 26 per cent in 2008.
  * The South East region has the largest absolute increase in households of 39,500 per year from 2008 to 2033, amounting to a 28 per cent increase on the number in 2008.
  * The North East region shows the smallest growth in households, at 8,500 per year from 2008 to 2033, amounting to a 19 per cent increase on the number in 2008.
  * The 2008-based projections show a lower growth in households compared with the 2006-based projections, equating to 20,500 fewer households per year between 2008 and 2031 in England.",Free,,26-Nov-10,statistics,statistics,,,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,providing-housing-support-for-older-and-vulnerable-people,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,improving-the-rented-housing-sector,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1780763.pdf,"Household Projections, 2008 to 2033, England",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1172100.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Household Projections,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/table401.xls,"Table 401: Household projections, United Kingdom, 1961-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/402.xls,"Chart 402: Household projections by household type, England, 1991-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/140945.xls,"Table 403: Household projections: by region, 1971-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/141266.xls,"Table 404: Household projections by household type and region, England, 1997-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/140987.xls,"Table 406: Household projections, by district, 1991-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/chart408.xls,"Chart 408: Household projections by region: England, 1991-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/140948.xls,"Table 411: Household projections: England, historical series, from 1861",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/table412.xls,"Table 412: Household projections by age of household reference person, England",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/table414.xls,"Table 414: Household projections: for older people, by age and district, 2008-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/table415.xls,"Table 415: Components of household growth (2008-2033) by region, England",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/table416.xls,"Table 416: Variant household projections, based on variant 2008-based population projections, England, thousands",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1781022.xls,"Table 417: Household projections by age, household type and region 2008 and 2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1781030.xls,"Table 418: Household projections by age, number of dependent children and region 2008 and 2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1781035.xls,"Table 419: Household projections by number of dependent children and region, England, 2001-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1781041.xls,"Table 419: Household projections by number of dependent children and region, England, 2001-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1781041.xls,"Table 419: Household projections by number of dependent children and region, England, 2001-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1781041.xls,"Table 419: Household projections by number of dependent children and region, England, 2001-2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1781041.xls,"Table 420: Household projections by household type and district, 2008 and 2033",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1781054.xls,"Table 424: Household projections by numbers of dependent children and district, 2008 and 2033",,,,,,,,NOTE: This is the live tables link http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/householdestimates/livetables-households/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A revised version has been released today under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority, incorporating amendments made by four local authorities. The total capital expenditure has increased by 0.07 per cent. Capital receipts remain the same.

The key points from the latest release are:

  * The underlying trend in capital expenditure shows an increase of 8 per cent from 2008-09 to 2009-10, to Â£21.4 billion.
  * Capital expenditure has risen by 28 per cent in the last four years, nearly 16 per cent in real terms.

### Revision

A number of errors were contained within these published statistics.

These errors related to the number of Code Certificates (at both Design and Post-Construction stage) issued by 22 of the 25 Welsh Planning Authorities. Although these errors affected the number of cases for individual Planning Authorities, it did not affect the overall total of cases in Wales. The statistics for England and Northern Ireland remain unchanged. The Cumulative and Quarterly Data commentary (.PDF and Word documents) are therefore unchanged as these relate to national statistics which remain the same.

We apologise for the error which was caused by an anomaly in the transfer of data which has now been rectified. The document 'Table of Welsh statistics changes' below sets out the data as originally published and as amended.

The published quarterly statistics have now been amended with the changes being denoted by an 'R' in the appropriate column. These were published 26 August 2011.",Free,,22-Feb-11,statistics,statistics,,,improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1849496.pdf,Code for sustainable homes and Energy Performance of Buildings: Cumulative and Quarterly Data up to December 2010,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/doc/1849499.doc,Code for sustainable homes and Energy Performance of Buildings: Cumulative and Quarterly Data up to December 2010,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1973136.xls,Code for sustainable homes and Energy Performance of Buildings: Cumulative and Quarterly Data up to December 2010 - Revised tables,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1907266.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Code for sustainable homes,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/2036380.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Code for sustainable homes and SAP release,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1973117.xls,Table of Welsh statistics changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest statistics release includes data from 2006 to 2011 updating those statistics previously issued on 31 March 2011.

**Number of dwellings**

  * In England there were 22.2 million dwellings on the Valuation Office valuation list liable for council tax as at 12 September 2011. This is an increase of 1 per cent compared with 2010 and an increase of 3 per cent compared with 2007.
  * The number of dwellings on the valuation list that are exempt from council tax increased by 1 per cent compared with 2010.
  * 34 per cent of all exemptions from council tax are class C (short term vacant dwellings).
  * A further 28 per cent of all exemptions are class M or N (student related exemptions). Of these, class M exemptions have increased by more than 50 per cent in the period 2007 to 2011.
  * The number of class L exemptions (unoccupied dwellings repossessed by a mortgage lender) again fell between September 2010 and September 2011 to 11,100, the third consecutive annual fall. There are now 4,800 (or 30 per cent) less class L exemptions than the peak in 2008.
  * The number of class Q exemptions (unoccupied dwellings where the person who would otherwise be liable is a trustee in bankruptcy) increased to 2,200 in September 2011. This compares with 400 in September 2007.
  * 7.7 million dwellings were entitled to a discount as a result of being occupied by single adults. This represents 33 per cent of all dwellings.
  * 2.7 million Band A dwellings (50 per cent of all dwellings liable to Band A council tax) were entitled to a single adults discount.
  * The total number of dwellings on the Valuation Office valuation list in England as at 12 September 2011 was 23.0 million, an increase of 137,000, or 1 per cent compared with 2010. Of this increase, 49,300, or 36 per cent of the total, are in London and the South East.

**Empty properties**

  * Between 2010 and 2011 the number of long-term empty dwellings subject to a discount fell by 30,000 (or 19 per cent). In the same period the number of long-term empty dwellings not subject to a discount increased by 9,000 (or 6 per cent).
  * The number of long term empty dwellings that were subject to a discount has fallen by 62,000, or 33 per cent, between 2007 and 2011. In the same period the number of long term empty dwellings that do not receive a discount has increased by 27,000 or 21 per cent. This gives a net reduction of 35,000, or 11 per cent, in the total number of empty dwellings.
  * Since the introduction of the New Homes Bonus in the summer of 2010 a number of authorities have taken the opportunity to review the empty properties and second homes in their area. A number have also altered the level of discount awarded with many abolishing the discount for empty properties altogether.

**Number of dwellings by region and valuation band**

  * Nationally, two-thirds of properties are in Bands A to C and only 9 per cent are in the top three bands.
  * The pattern varies widely across regions. In the North East 56 per cent of all properties are in Band A; in London the figure is just 4 per cent. London and the South East accounts for 70 per cent of all Band H properties in England.",Free,,16-Nov-11,statistics,statistics,,,making-sure-council-tax-payers-get-good-value-for-money,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/2030041.pdf,Local Authority Council Taxbase 2011 England,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/doc/2030044.doc,Local Authority Council Taxbase 2011 England,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2030053.xls,Chart A: Distribution of dwellings by council tax band and region as at 12 September 2011,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2030063.xls,Table 1: Number of chargeable dwellings 2007-2011,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2030068.xls,Table 2: Number of dwellings on valuation list as at 12 September 2011 (by region),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2030071.xls,"Table 3: Dwellings, exemptions and discounts by valuation band as at 12 September 2011",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2030082.xls,Table 4: Number of dwellings exempt from council tax by class of exemption 2007 to 2011,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/203045312.xls,Council tax base local authority level data 2011,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/20305711.xls,Council tax base local authority level data 2010,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/13868861.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Local Authority Council Taxbase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first detailed report of findings relating to households from the new survey, and builds on results reported in the EHS Headline Report published in February 2010.

The English Housing Survey Housing Stock Report 2008 was also published on 27 October 2010.

The EHS began in April 2008 and brings together two former DCLG housing surveys - the _English House Condition Survey_ and the _Survey of English Housing_.

The report includes the following findings:

  * The total number of households in England was 21.5 million in 2008-09, up from 20.2 million in 1999. Of these, 68 per cent were owner occupiers, 18 per cent were social renters, and 14 per cent were private renters. Owner-occupation decreased from a peak of 70.9 per cent of households in 2003 to 67.9 per cent in 2008-09. In contrast, the proportion of households renting privately rose from 10.8 per cent  to 14.2 per cent over the same period.
  * 656,000 households (3.0 per cent) were overcrowded, with about a third of these households living in London. Overcrowding rates were higher in rented tenures than in owner-occupation: 6.7 per cent of social renters and 5.4 per cent of private renters compared to 1.6 per cent of owner-occupiers. Under-occupancy was highest in the South West and East Midlands (both 40 per cent).
  * Some 61 per cent of households in the private rented sector worked full time compared with 24 per cent of households in the social rented sector. However, a much higher proportion of social renters than private renters were retired: 31 per cent compared to 9 per cent. Private renters tended to be younger than social renters: 60 per cent of social renters were aged 45 or over compared with 29 per cent of private renters.
  * The average weekly rent for households in the private rented sector was Â£153, compared with Â£72 for social renters.
  * 1.9 million households had moved into their current accommodation in the twelve-month period prior to 2008-09, a reduction of 21 per cent compared with the previous year.
  * Of private renter households, 36 per cent had lived in their home for less than a year, compared with 4 per cent of owner occupiers and 8 per cent of social renters. Over half (54 per cent) of owner-occupiers and 40 per cent of social renters had not moved in the past 10 years. Only 11 per cent of private renters had lived in their home for over 10 years.
  * Overall, 87 per cent of households were very or fairly satisfied with their local area and 90 per cent were satisfied with their accommodation, with older householders most likely to express satisfaction.",Free,,27-Oct-10,statistics,statistics-national-statistics,,9781409826002,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,providing-housing-support-for-older-and-vulnerable-people,increasing-the-number-of-available-homes,improving-the-rented-housing-sector,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1750765.pdf,English Housing Survey 2008-09 Household Report,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/2178016.pdf,English Housing Survey 2008-09 Household Report - Errata,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1750039.xls,English Housing Survey 2008-09 Household Report - annex tables chapter 1,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1750087.xls,English Housing Survey 2008-09 Household Report - annex tables chapter 2,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1750092.xls,English Housing Survey 2008-09 Household Report - annex tables chapter 3,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1750095.xls,English Housing Survey 2008-09 Household Report - annex tables chapter 4,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1750105.xls,English Housing Survey 2008-09 Household Report - annex tables chapter 5,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/17506221.pdf,Pre-release Access list: English House Survey - Household Report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first detailed report of findings relating to the housing stock from the new survey, and builds on results reported in the EHS Headline Report published in February 2010.

The English Housing Survey Household Report 2008-09 was also published on 27 October 2010.

The EHS began in April 2008 and brings together two former DCLG housing surveys - the _English House Condition Survey_ and the _Survey of English Housing_.

The report included the following highlights:

  * In 2008 there were around 22.2 million dwellings in England. Over one in five (21 per cent) were built before 1919
  * Since 2001 there has been a significant reduction in the amount of disrepair in the stock. Private rented dwellings, converted flats and dwellings in city centres improved most; however the average repair costs for these groups of dwellings were still higher than for other groups in 2008
  * The energy efficiency (SAP) rating of the housing stock steadily improved from a mean of 42 SAP points in 1996 to 51 in 2008
  * The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with heating and lighting the home averaged 6.3 tonnes/year for each dwelling in 2008. The social sector accounted for only 11 per cent of the total CO2 emissions associated with heating and lighting
  * Following the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) methodology, the survey estimated that 20.1 million dwellings could benefit from one or more cost effective improvement measures, such as loft and cavity wall insulation, upgraded boilers and heating controls
  * If all these improvements were carried out, the mean SAP rating would increase by more than 11 points and, potentially, CO2 emissions for heating and lighting the home could fall by 26 per cent.

The report included the following highlights:

  * A decrease in the number of owner occupied households from a peak of 14.8 million in 2005 and 2006 to 14.5 million in 2009-10. In contrast the number of households renting privately has risen by 1.3 million since 2001, from 2.1 million to 3.4 million in 2009-10.
  * In 2009-10, social renters paid on average Â£75 per week in rent and private renters Â£153. Around 62 per cent of social renters received Housing Benefit compared to 24 per cent of private renters.
  * In 2009-10, 1.8 million households had moved into their current home during the previous 12 months. This was 200,000 less than in 2008-09, and 600,000 less than in 2007-08.  The reduction was almost all in the owner occupied sector.
  * The energy efficiency of the housing stock continued to improve, with the average SAP rating increasing from 42 to 53 between 1996 and 2009. The rented sectors - private and social - improved more than the owner occupied sector.
  * Some 6.7 million homes (30 per cent) were non-decent in 2009, down from 7.4 million (33 per cent) in 2008. Overall, social sector homes were in a better condition than private sector homes with 23 per cent being non-decent compared to 31per cent.
  * Around 1.8 million dwellings had damp problems in 2009 (no significant change from the previous year).

The English Housing Survey Household Report 2009-10 was also published on 5 July 2011.

The EHS began in April 2008 bringing together two former DCLG housing surveys - the English House Condition Survey and the Survey of English Housing.

The report includes the following findings:

  * Some 8.8 million (38 per cent) of the 22.3 million dwellings in England in 2009 were built before 1945, 4.8 million (21 per cent) before 1919.
  * The energy efficiency (SAP) rating of the housing stock steadily improved from a mean of 42 SAP points in 1996 to 53 in 2009. Improvement was particularly marked in local authority and private rented housing.
  * However in 2009 there were still 3.3 million dwellings in the lowest Energy Efficiency Rating Bands F and G.
  * If cost effective energy improvements (averaging around Â£1,400/dwelling) were carried out to all 19.3 million dwellings that would benefit from them, the average SAP rating would increase from 53 to 63 and the average CO2 emissions per dwelling could be reduced from 6.0 to 4.6 tonnes/year.
  * There has only been a modest improvement in the proportion of the stock with problems of damp (from 10 per cent to 8 per cent), primarily because the incidence of serious condensation and mould (one cause of damp) has not changed from 4 per cent of all dwellings.
  * Electrical safety has improved significantly since 2001 - especially for rented dwellings in both the private and social sectors.
  * There has been a significant reduction in the amount of disrepair since 2001 - particularly in private rented housing although this sector still had on average much higher average repair costs than other tenures in 2009.

The English Housing Survey began in April 2008 bringing together two former DCLG housing surveys - the English House Condition Survey and the Survey of English Housing.

The report includes the following findings:

  * The largest tenure type in 2010-11 was owner occupation, with 14.45 million households (66 per cent). This continued a slight downward trend from a peak of 14.79 million households in owner occupation (71 per cent) in 2005. The private rented sector continued to increase in size, to 3.62 million households (17 per cent).
  * Owner occupiers buying with a mortgage made average weekly mortgage payments of Â£143. This compared to average weekly rent payments of Â£160 made by privately renting households, and Â£79 by social renters.
  * 59 per cent of private renters and 23 per cent of social renters said they expected to buy a home in the UK, at some point. Of these, 16 per cent had considered applying for a mortgage in the last 12 months. Recent first time buyers were 6 per cent of owner occupiers.
  * There were two million recently moving households in 2010-11, compared to 1.8 million in 2009-10. Of these, 62 per cent were private renters, 22 per cent were owner occupiers and 16 per cent were social renters.
  * Households living in poverty were more likely to live in homes that had significant outstanding repairs and damp problems than households who were not living in poverty.
  * The majority of households were satisfied with their local areas and their accommodation. However, although the majority of people felt their areas had not changed much over the previous two years, across all tenures, they were more likely to say their local area had got worse than better.

The English Housing Survey began in April 2008 bringing together two former DCLG housing surveys - the English House Condition Survey and the Survey of English Housing.

The report includes the following findings:

  * In 2010, there were 22.4 million dwellings in England. Some 66 per cent of these were owner occupied and the rest were rented, split fairly evenly between the private rented sector (17 per cent) and social rented sector (17 per cent). There were slightly more housing association dwellings (2 million) than local authority dwellings (1.8 million).
  * Some 52% of the private rented stock was built before 1945 including 40 per cent built before 1919. Also, 15 per cent of private rented homes were converted flats.
  * The total cost of dealing with basic disrepair (day to day maintenance) within the stock was around Â£31.8 billion at 2010 prices and the average cost of this type of disrepair was Â£1,418 per dwelling.
  * The proportion of dwellings with damp problems fell from 10 per cent in 2001 to 7 per cent in 2010. This was mainly due to a fall in the incidence of problems caused by penetrating damp.
  * The average energy efficiency rating for the whole stock (using SAP09) has increased from 45 in 1996 to 55 in 2010.
  * The average SAP rating in the social sector in 2010 was around eight points higher than either owner occupied or private rented homes (62 compared with 54).

Statistics in this release are the latest figures available for England and relate to periods up to 31 March 2012.

The key points are as follows:

### Response times

  * In 2011-12, the average response time to fires in dwellings was 7.2 minutes (10 seconds shorter than in 2010-11) and 7.9 minutes to fires in other buildings (5 seconds shorter than in 2010-11).
  * Average response times in 2011-12 were higher than in 2001-02 by around 22 per cent for dwelling fires and by around 29 per cent for fires in other buildings.

### Severity of fires

  * On average, improvements in fire safety and prevention have greatly outweighed the effect of longer average response times.
  * In 2011-12, there were 54 per cent fewer fire non-fatal casualties and 34 per cent fewer fire fatalities than in 2001-02.

Key points in the publication are:

  * The majority of fire-related deaths occur in dwelling fires (three quarters in 2008). The highest fire fatality rates were for people aged 80 or over, and for males, and in Scotland
  * Smoke alarms were absent from the fire area in 38 per cent of dwelling fires (18,600 fires). Of the total of 353 dwelling fires fatalities in the UK in 2008, 130 (37 per cent) of these fatalities were in fires where there was no smoke alarm present, and a further 100 fatalities (28 per cent) where a smoke alarm was present but did not operate.
  * The proportion of households with a working smoke alarm increased rapidly from 8 per cent in 1988 to 70 per cent in 1994, and has continued to rise in recent years to 91 per cent in 2008.
  * More than half (54 per cent) of accidental fires in homes arose from cooking. Other common sources of ignition were: electrical appliances (13 per cent), smokers' materials (7 per cent), electrical distribution (7 per cent) and space heating appliances (4 per cent).

For the first time, estimates have been made for missing local authority data and thus the figures in this release have been grossed up to be nationally representative of all local authorities in England.

The key points from the latest release are:

  * In 2009-10, a total of 165,200 cases of homelessness prevention or relief are estimated to have taken place outside the statutory homelessness framework in England. Of these cases 140,900 (85 per cent) were preventions and 24,300 (15 per cent) were cases of relief.
  * 61 per cent of cases of homelessness prevention and relief involved the household being assisted to obtain alternative accommodation. The remaining 39 per cent involved the cases being assisted to remain in their existing home.
  * The most common action taken by authorities and partner organisations to assist households in obtaining alternative accommodation was the use of landlord incentive schemes to secure private rented sector accommodation (36 per cent of the cases assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation).
  * The most common action taken to enable households to remain in their own home was assistance to remain in the private or social rented sector, which comprised 21 per cent of the cases who remained in their own home.
  * There were 5,200 homelessness prevention cases who were helped to stay in their home thanks to the protection of a sanctuary scheme.
  * Homelessness prevention and relief activity varies across the regions. London had the highest rate of cases of preventions and relief with 10.3 cases per 1,000 households.

This is the third year figures on homelessness prevention and relief have been published by the Department for Communities and Local Government under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.

This is the first time year-on-year comparisons can be made, however, care should be taken when comparing annual figures as more comprehensive reporting by local authorities over time is known to be a contributing factor to the rise in activity we have seen in the past two years. Thus it is difficult to estimate the real increase in activity undertaken by local authorities and partner organisations.

The key points from the latest release are:

  * In 2010-11, a total of 188,800 cases of homelessness prevention or relief are estimated to have taken place outside the statutory homelessness framework in England. Of these cases 163,800 (87 per cent) were preventions and 24,800 (13 per cent) were cases of relief.
  * The total number of cases of homelessness prevention or relief increased by 14 per cent when compared to 2009-10. This is mostly due to an increase in prevention cases, which increased by 16 per cent, whilst cases of relief increased by only 2 per cent.
  * In 2010-11, 57 per cent of cases of homelessness prevention and relief involved the household being assisted to obtain alternative accommodation. The remaining 43 per cent involved the cases being assisted to remain in their existing home. This compares to 61 and 39 per cent respectively in 2009-10.
  * The most common action taken to prevent or relieve homelessness was the use of landlord incentive schemes to secure private rented sector accommodation. In 2010-11, 30,800 cases (29 per cent) were assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation this way, though this was a decrease in activity of 15 per cent compared to 2009-10.
  * Yorkshire and the Humber had the highest rate of cases of prevention and relief with 10.8 cases per 1,000 households. The North East (10.4 cases per 1,000 households), East Midlands (10.2) and London (10.1) also had high rates of prevention and relief. The East of England, with 6.6 cases per 1,000 households, had the lowest rate.

  * Net additions to the stock (new build plus conversions and change of use, less demolitions) rose from 132,000 net additions per annum in 2000-01, to a peak of 207,370 in 2007-08 before falling to 128,680 in 2009-10.
  * Between 2008 and 2009, new build completions decreased by 17 per cent, from 143,000 to 118,000.

  * During 2009-10, local authorities made 89,120 decisions on eligible applications for housing assistance under homelessness legislation. Nearly half of these - 40,020 - were accepted as owed a main homelessness duty, 70 per cent lower than the peak in 2003-04.
  * The overall rate of overcrowding in England in 2008-09 was 3.0 per cent, with an estimated 656,000 households living in overcrowded conditions.
  * There were an estimated 8,510 total social housing sales to sitting tenants in England in 2009-10, an increase of 16 per cent on 2008-09. However there was a 20 per cent decrease in Right to Buy sales from 2008-09.

  * There was a steady decline in the percentage of homes in the least energy efficient Band G, from 9 per cent in 1996 to less than 4 per cent in 2008.
  * In 2009, on a provisional estimate, 80 per cent of dwellings (including conversions) were built on previously-developed land, unchanged from 2008.
  * In the year ending June 2010, authorities that undertake district level planning received around 475,000 applications, compared to around 1,600 for those authorities responsible for 'county matters' applications.

The scheme has two elements:

  1. the 'Government Mortgage to Rent' option which involves a RSL purchasing the homeowner's property, enabling the household to remain in the property as a tenant on an assured short hold tenancy, paying an intermediate rent; and
  2. the 'Shared Equity' option which involves a RSL providing a loan to the homeowner to enable the homeowner's monthly mortgage payments to be reduced

The figures, presented by Government Office Region, are based on Mortgage Rescue Scheme returns submitted to Communities and Local Government by local authorities and data from the fast-track case management system. Local authority figures do not contain estimates for missing returns. Information on the local authority response rate is provided alongside the reported figures for each period. Figures for different periods are shown on separate tabs in the workbook.

Following a consultation with users of the data (local authority representatives, housing associations, mortgage lenders and central government users), from August 2009, the release of summary Mortgage Rescue Scheme monitoring statistics moved to a quarterly publication schedule. The quarterly schedule allows the co-ordination of Mortgage Rescue Scheme monitoring statistics releases with the quarterly statistical publications on repossessions produced by the Ministry of Justice and the Council of Mortgage Lenders.",Free,,13-May-10,statistics,statistics,,,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1215933.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Mortgage Rescue Scheme monitoring statistics,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/xls/1684350.xls,"Table 1303: Mortgage Rescue Scheme monitoring statistics as reported by local authorities, by region",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mortgage Rescue Scheme monitoring statistics 'housing live table' gives information on the number of households that approached local authorities with mortgage difficulties and applications and acceptances for the scheme.

The scheme had two elements:

  1. the 'Government Mortgage to Rent' option which involved a registered social landlord purchasing the homeowner's property, enabling the household to remain in the property as a tenant on an assured short hold tenancy, paying an intermediate rent
  2. the 'Shared Equity' option which involved a registered social landlord providing a loan to the homeowner to enable the homeowner's monthly mortgage payments to be reduced.

The figures, presented by Government Office Region, are derived from Mortgage Rescue Scheme returns submitted to Communities and Local Government by local authorities, the fast-track case management system, Shelter monitoring returns and Homes and Communities Agency management information.

Local authority figures do not contain estimates for missing returns. Information on the local authority response rate is provided alongside the reported figures for each period.

The fast-track team which was launched in September 2009 to centrally take referrals directly from lenders and process them through to completion, ceased taking new referrals at the end of June 2010 and closed on 31 August 2010, with all ongoing cases passed to Shelter for action. Up to and including Q2 2010 all figures on fast-track cases and completions come from the fast-track case management system. From Q3 2010 onwards Shelter monitoring returns have been used to provide figures on live former fast-track cases where they are carrying out the initial assessment and Homes and Communities Agency management information has been used to provide figures on live cases referred to registered social landlords or with an offer from a registered social landlord as at the end of the quarter and the number of households that have accepted an offer through the scheme during the quarter. There will therefore be a discontinuity in the fast-track figures from Q3 2010 onwards.

Figures for different periods are shown on separate tabs in the workbook. The figures undergo validation and cross checking overseen by DCLG statisticians and are reconciled with Homes and Communities Agency management information on the number of households that have accepted an offer through the scheme.

These figures have been pre-released in accordance with the Pre-release Access Order and the pre release access list can be found in the Downloads below.

Changes to the scheme from April mean that DCLG will no longer need to collect detailed data from Local authorities on live Mortgage Rescue Scheme cases and completions to manage the pipeline.

The department will continue to collect a small amount of quarterly data on households approaching authorities with mortgage difficulties to ensure that the positive impact of Mortgage Rescue Scheme in encouraging households to come forward for money advice can be monitored and evidenced. The Homes and Communities Agency will continue to collect monitoring information from Mortgage Rescue Scheme providers on live cases and completions of cases currently in the pipeline and under the new scheme. Details of these changes have been published in the housing and homelessness annex of the draft statistics plan which is out for consultation until the 3rd June 2011, see related publications below.

1. the 'Government Mortgage to Rent' option which involves a RSL purchasing the homeowner's property, enabling the household to remain in the property as a tenant on an assured short hold tenancy, paying an intermediate rent; and

2. the 'Shared Equity' option which involves a RSL providing a loan to the homeowner to enable the homeowner's monthly mortgage payments to be reduced.

The figures, presented by Government Office Region, are based on Mortgage Rescue Scheme returns submitted to Communities and Local Government by local authorities and data from the fast-track case management system. Local authority figures do not contain estimates for missing returns. Information on the local authority response rate is provided alongside the reported figures for each period. Figures for different periods are shown on separate tabs in the workbook. The figures undergo validation and cross checking overseen by CLG statisticians and overall totals are reconciled with management information owned by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) on the number of households that have accepted an offer through the scheme during the period.

The Mortgage Rescue Scheme monitoring statistics are released quarterly on the same day as statistical publications on repossessions produced by the Ministry of Justice and the Council of Mortgage Lenders.

These figures have been pre-released in accordance with the Pre-release Access Order and the pre-release access list is available for download below.

Local authority figures do not contain estimates for missing returns. Information on the local authority response rate is provided alongside the reported figures for each period.

The fast-track team which was launched in September 2009 to centrally take referrals directly from lenders and process them through to completion, ceased taking new referrals at the end of June 2010 and closed on 31 August 2010, with all ongoing cases passed to Shelter for action. Up to and including Q2 2010 all figures on fast-track cases and completions come from the fast-track case management system.

From Q3 2010 onwards Shelter monitoring returns have been used to provide figures on live former fast-track cases where they are carrying out the initial assessment and HCA management information has been used to provide figures on live cases referred to RSLs or with an offer from an RSL as at the end of the quarter and the number of households that have accepted an offer through the scheme during the quarter. There will therefore be a discontinuity in the fast-track figures from Q3 2010 onwards.

The key findings of these statistics are:

  * Eighty-nine per cent of landlords were private individual landlords responsible for 71 per cent of all private rented dwellings, with a further 5 per cent of landlords being company landlords responsible for 15 per cent  of dwellings.
  * More than three quarters (78 per cent) of all landlords only owned a single dwelling for rent, with only 8 per cent of landlords stating they were full time landlords.
  * The majority (54 per cent) of dwellings met the Decent Homes Standard though this rose to nearly three-quarters (74 per cent) for those let by new landlords. Over two-fifths (42 per cent) of all dwellings have had an Energy Performance Certificate.
  * Fifty-one per cent of all dwellings were acquired since 2000, 25 per cent in the ten years between 1990 and 1999.
  * In terms of formal letting and management practices, nearly all landlords and agents (97 per cent) made use of a written tenancy agreement, with 91 per cent requiring a deposit, and 84% requiring tenants to provide a reference.
  * Almost half (47 per cent) of all landlords were happy to rent to tenants on Housing Benefit (HB) or the Local Housing Allowance (LHA), with a further 21 per cent saying they would be encouraged to do so if payments were not made direct to the tenant.
  * In terms of issues considered a serious problem, 18 per cent of landlords or agents stated issues related to HB or the LHA, and 10 per cent the level of HB in the area. Issues not considered a problem by landlords were low demand (82 per cent), mortgage payments (76 per cent) and finding reliable builders (73 per cent).
  * A third (33 per cent) of landlords and agents, who had heard of the Housing Health and Safety Rating System reported that 58 per cent of the dwellings they were collectively responsible for had received some form of assessment for potential hazards.",Free,,18-Oct-11,statistics,statistics,,9781409831884,improving-the-rented-housing-sector,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/2010380.pdf,Private Landlord Survey 2010,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2010393.xls,Private Landlord Survey 2010: Tables,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/2026831.pdf,Private Landlords' Survey 2009-10: Questionnaire documentation,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/2010397.pdf,Pre-release Access List: Private Landlord Survey 2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

### Correction

Following publication at 9:30am 29 September 2011, an error was identified in the data.

In the original version of this publication the Revenue Account figures for total service expenditure and for net current expenditure, referred to in tables 2 and 3, as well as in the commentary did not agree with figures published in the Statistical Release ""Local authority revenue expenditure and financing England: 2011-12 Budget"". The error was in the budget figures quoted in this release, which was caused by the way in which non-pay elements of schools expenditure are imputed. These figures have been replaced by the figures published in the above named release.

As a consequence of this change, comparison figures (percentage changes on budget) calculated and described in this release have been revised. The commentary has been updated to reflect these changes.

In correcting this error, the need to further caveat figures relating to education and to the in-year forecast for net current expenditure has become apparent. In light of this, additions have been made to the 'strengths and limitations of the data' section of this release.",Free,,29-Sep-11,statistics,statistics,,9781409831785,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/199701811.pdf,Quarterly Revenue Outturn for Local Authorities in England: Quarter 1 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1997028.xls,Quarterly Revenue Outturn for Local Authorities in England: Quarter 1 2011-12 - Individual local authority data,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/19970311.pdf,Mapping of lines on the QRO form to RA (Revenue Account) and RO (Revenue Outturn) lines,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/19970492.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Quarterly Revenue Outturn for Local Authorities in England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The release provides data from revenue outturn returns and the changes over the previously published figures are generally small.

The key points from the latest release are:

  * Total net current expenditure by local authorities in England was estimated to be Â£121.3bn in 2009-10 compared with Â£113.0bn in 2008-09, an increase of 7 per cent.

The second change involves reporting net current expenditure on a non-Financial Reporting Standard 17 (FRS17) basis (previously for 2008-09 local authorities accounted for retirement benefits (pensions) in their service expenditure in accordance with FRS17). If we remove RECS from this year's figure and use the 2008-09 figure on a non-FRS17 basis, then the 2009-10 net current expenditure is Â£119.4bn and for 2008-09 is Â£113.7bn, an increase of 5 per cent.
  * 37 per cent of net current expenditure in 2009-10 was on education, 17 per cent on social care, 14 per cent on housing benefits and 10 per cent on police.
  * 56 per cent of revenue expenditure (on a non-Financial Reporting Standard 17 basis) in 2009-10 was funded by government grants, 25 per cent by council tax and 19 per cent by redistributed non-domestic rates.",Free,,27-Jan-11,statistics,statistics-national-statistics,,9781409826705,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1826743.pdf,Local authority revenue expenditure and financing England 2009-10 final outturn (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/doc/1826746.doc,Local authority revenue expenditure and financing England 2009-10 final outturn (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826840.xls,Table 1 Net current expenditure by service 2008-09 and 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826843.xls,Table 2 Revenue expenditure and financing 2008-09 and 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826846.xls,Table 3 Net current expenditure by service 2005-06 to 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826849.xls,Table 4 Top five incomes from specific grants 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826852.xls,Table 5 Financing of revenue expenditure since 2005-06 (a) (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826855.xls,Table 6 Level of revenue reserves (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826761.xls,Annex A1  Revenue Outturn Service Expenditure Summary (RSX) 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826769.xls,Annex A2  Revenue Outturn Summary (RS)  2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826772.xls,Annex A3  Income from specific grants (RG) 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826781.xls,Annex A4  Revenue Outturn Education services (RO1) 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826790.xls,Annex A5  Revenue Outturn Highways and Transport services (RO2) 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826793.xls,Annex A6  Revenue Outturn Social Care (RO3) 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826802.xls,Annex A7  Revenue Outturn Housing services (RO4) 2009-10 (revised),http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1826805.xls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  * The 2010 total of street counts in authorities with a known or suspected rough sleeping problem was 440. This is down slightly on the 2009 total of 464 and is the lowest total count since the current methodology was introduced in 1998.
  * 70 local authorities conducted a street count. For the first time the 256 authorities that did not count were asked to provide estimates of the number of people sleeping rough on any given night.
  * The total of the estimates of rough sleepers in the 256 authorities that did not conduct a count was 807.
  * The combined total of estimates and counts of rough sleepers in England in 2010 was 1,247; this comprised 440 from the 70 authorities that conducted a count and 807 from the 256 authorities that provided estimates.

### Experimental Statistics

Experimental Official Statistics are Statistics that are in the testing phase and are not fully developed. These statistics are designated Experimental Official Statistics because the rough sleeping estimates for authorities that did not conduct a count constitute a new methodology which is still being tested and is subject to modification following evaluation and consultation with users.

### Data Quality

In 1996 a methodology for assessing levels of rough sleeping was established based on a one-night count of people found 'bedded down'. This methodology has been used since to track progress against a total of 1,850 found on counts in 1998.

Rough sleeping counts are carried out in accordance with DCLG guidance and checked and verified by independent verifiers. The counts undergo validation and cross checking by DCLG statisticians and anomalous data are highlighted and verified by contacting the local authority.

This is the first time that precise estimates have been gathered from all authorities that did not conduct a street count.  The estimates undergo validation and cross checking by DCLG statisticians and anomalous data are highlighted and verified by contacting the local authority. They have been designated Experimental Official Statistics and will be evaluated and may be modified following consultation with users.

The 2010 figures are based on counts or estimates from all 326 local authorities (100 per cent response).

### Guidance for local authorities

#### Rough Sleeping Counts

Following the consultation paper that was issued on 23 July 2010, the Department for Communities and Local Government published new policy guidance - _Evaluating the Extent of Rough Sleeping: A new approach_ - to help local authorities, in partnership with other local agencies, to carry out a count or submit an estimate of people sleeping rough in their area. This guidance, published on 14 September 2010, explains in detail how the counts are carried out and the procedures in place to ensure consistency in count techniques and how to prepare robust estimates across England. The guidance can be accessed via 'Related publications' below.

### Rough sleeping estimates

Local authorities who did not carry out a count between January 2009 and May 2010 were asked to submit a single figure estimate of the number of people sleeping rough on any given night as at June 2010. In order to obtain a robust estimate these authorities were referred to the definition of people sleeping rough as given in the guidance and advised to speak to the voluntary sector, the police and other local agencies in order to obtain local intelligence on rough sleeping in their local area.

### Consultation

A consultation on the guidance for evaluating the extent of rough sleeping in local areas was issued on 23 July 2010. The consultation sought the views of users on proposals for carrying out counts and producing estimates in the future. The consultation can be accessed via 'Related publications' below.

Related Live Table 675 has also been corrected.

The latest statistics on social housing sales to sitting tenants in England in 2009-10 were released under the auspices of the UK Statistics Authority on Tuesday 21 September 2010.

These statistics cover sales through Right to Buy, Preserved Right to Buy, Right to Acquire, Social HomeBuy and other outright or shared equity sales to sitting tenants. They do not include Low Cost Home Ownership sales through shared ownership schemes to non-social tenants.

Key points from the release are:

  * There were an estimated 8,510 total social housing sales to sitting tenants in England in 2009-10, an increase of 16 per cent on 2008-09. The increase contrasts with falls in social housing sales in recent years and was due to an increase in sales of Registered Provider properties.
  * There were an estimated 3,100 Right to Buy sales in England in 2009-10 (36 per cent of all sales), a 20 per cent decrease from 2008-09. Around three-quarters of Right to Buy sales were of Local Authority properties.
  * A further 2,940 sales (35 per cent of total sales) were disposals of Registered Provider properties to the private sector. Other shared equity and outright sales to sitting tenants accounted for the remaining sales.
  * The average market value of Local Authority properties purchased through Right to Buy in 2009-10 was Â£101,260. This produced average capital receipts of Â£74,610 and an average discount of Â£26,660 per property.
  * Registered Provider sales included 90 properties sold through the Right to Acquire scheme (compared to 180 in 2008-09) and 80 through Social HomeBuy (compared to 100 in 2008-09).",Free,,21-Sep-10,statistics,statistics,,9781409825715,helping-people-to-buy-a-home,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/17207621.pdf,"Social Housing Sales to sitting tenants, England, 2009-10",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/doc/17207661.doc,"Social Housing Sales to sitting tenants, England, 2009-10",http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1319730.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Social Housing Sales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Social housing sales include sales under Right to Buy, Preserved Right to Buy, Right to Acquire, Social HomeBuy, other outright or shared equity sales to tenants, and sales of existing stock to the private sector. The figures exclude sales through low cost home ownership schemes where these do not relate to existing social stock, i.e. sales of newly built homes for shared ownership or acquisitions of private sector homes for affordable home ownership. Intra-tenure transfers between social housing providers are also excluded.

Key points from the release are:

  * There were an estimated 8,410 total social housing sales in England in 2010-11. This is a decrease of 2 per cent on 2009-10 and continues the low level of sales seen in the previous two years. A decrease in Private Registered Provider sales was partly offset by an increase in Local Authority sales.
  * There were an estimated 3,690 Right to Buy sales in England in 2010-11 (44 per cent of all sales), a 16 per cent increase from 2010-11. Most (74 per cent) Right to Buy sales were of Local Authority properties.
  * The average market value of Local Authority properties purchased through Right to Buy in 2010-11 was Â£103,970. Average capital receipts were Â£77,470 and the average discount was Â£26,510 per property.
  * Registered Provider sales included 200 properties sold through the Right to Acquire scheme (compared to 90 in 2009-10) and 100 through Social HomeBuy (compared to 70 in 2009-10).
  * A further 3,340 sales (40 per cent of total sales) were disposals of Registered Provider properties to the private sector. Other shared equity and outright sales of existing stock accounted for the remaining sales.

Estimates cover the whole social housing sector, including both housing associations and local authorities. The figures are based on lettings information reported through the Continuous Recording of Lettings (CORE) system for 2009-10 and the Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix. More information on CORE can be found on the CORE website (see link on the right).

Participation in CORE by local authorities is not yet complete and some local authorities do not yet provide CORE data, so the local authority figures have been adjusted to take account of missing data.

For general needs, social housing lettings, between 2007-08 and 2009-10, key findings include:

  * The number of general needs lettings across social housing in 2009-10 was estimated at 263,000 - similar to the 264,000 lettings in 2008-09.
  * The number of lettings to households headed by jobseekers rose by one-third, from 38,800 (16.6 per cent) of lettings in 2008-09 to 51,600 (21.1 per cent) of lettings in 2009-10. This was consistent with the economic downturn that saw the overall number of unemployed rise by 28 per cent over the same period.
  * The rise in the number of lettings to jobseeking households was offset by a reduction in lettings to: (a) households at home not seeking work, which fell from 24.1 per cent of lettings in 2008-09 to 22.1 per cent in 2009-10, and (b) full-time workers, which fell from 23.1 per cent to 21.2 per cent.
  * There was a rise in the proportion of lettings to Black or Black British tenants from 7.6 per cent to 8.4 per cent. This was mostly offset by a decline in the number of lettings to Asian or Asian British households - down from 4.5 percent to 3.9 per cent. The proportion of lettings to white ethnic groups was little changed: 83.6 per cent to 83.8 per cent.
  * For new tenants, the proportion of lettings to new foreign national tenants increased from 6.8 per cent to 7.7 per cent.

For general needs social housing lettings, key findings include:

  * There were 269,000 general needs lettings across social housing in 2010-11 - a 2 per cent increase from 263,000 in 2009-10. This increase has been caused by a rise in the number of housing association lettings from 138,000 to 151,000 households, whilst the number of local authority lettings has decreased from 126,000 to 117,000.
  * The distribution of lettings by household type has remained similar over time. In 2010-11 there was a small increase in the proportion to older people (a household where either the tenant or their partner is aged 60 or over) from 9.6 per cent of all general needs lettings to 10.8 per cent.
  * There has been a decrease in the number of lettings to people aged 16-24. The proportion of lettings to households headed by females that were 16-24 decreased from 32.7 per cent to 30.7 per cent. The proportion of lettings to males that were 16-24 decreased from 18.4 to 17.6
  * There was a small decline in the proportion of lettings to white ethnic from 83.8 per cent to 82.6 per cent in 2010-11. This mainly reflected a rise in the proportion of lettings to black or black British tenants from 8.4 per cent to 9.2 per cent
  * In 2010-11, 96 per cent of lettings to existing tenants and 91 per cent of new lettings went to UK nationals.

### Data Quality

Figures are as reported by providers of housing related support services; no estimates are made for missing returns.  Data is checked and validated by quality assessors at the Client Records and Outcomes Office based at the University of St Andrews. Validation is carried out according to set list of detectable errors and these errors are resolved by contacting the service provider submitting the data.

### Revisions - methodology change

The method for calculating the percentage of clients achieving outcomes has been changed to exclude 'not applicable' cases from the denominator. This change affects the following outcomes; achieved qualifications, established contact with external services/groups and established contact with family/friends. The number of clients achieving these outcomes is not affected. This change was applied in February 2011. Figures previously published on the DCLG website for Q1 (April - June) 2010/11 and Q1-2 (April - September) 2010/11 have been revised according to this new method of calculation.

This is the final publication of Supporting People client records and outcomes data following the cessation of these data collections. Supporting People rolled into Formula Grant from April 2011 increasing authorities' freedom and flexibility in how they are able to spend their funding. As Formula Grant is a single grant that is not divided by any service in any way, there is no specific budget allocation for Supporting People services.  Therefore it is no longer appropriate for the Department to continue to collect data returns that specifically correlate to Supporting People services.

### Data Quality

Figures are as reported by providers of housing related support services; no estimates are made for missing returns. Data is checked and validated by quality assessors at the Client Records and Outcomes Office based at the University of St Andrews. Validation is carried out according to set list of detectable errors and these errors are resolved by contacting the service provider submitting the data.

### Methodology change

The period for collection of finalised Supporting People Client Record, Outcomes for short-term services and Outcomes for long-term services data for 2010-11 changed to a 57 week data collection window, compared to a 74 week data collection window in 2009-10.

This change is likely to have affected the number of forms collected.

  * 231,200 CR forms were received in 2010-11, a decrease of 3 per cent from 2009-10. (In 2009-10 239,400 forms were received).
  * 188,900 Outcomes forms for short-term services were received in 2010-11, an increase of 8 per cent from 2009-10. (In 2009-10 174,700 forms were received).
  * 39,900 outcomes forms for long-term services were received in 2010-11, a decrease of 18 per cent from 2009-10. (In 2009-10 48,900 forms were received).

This change affects the following outcomes; achieved qualifications, established contact with external services/groups and established contact with family/friends. The number of clients achieving these outcomes is not affected. This change was applied in February 2011.

This change affects the following outcomes; achieved qualifications, established contact with external services/groups and established contact with family/friends. The number of clients achieving these outcomes is not affected. This change results in a difference in reporting of the Q1-Q3 2010/11 figures as follows:

  * 67 per cent (8,500) of clients leaving short-term Supporting People services achieved qualifications, as a proportion of those identifying a need. Under the previous method this would have been calculated as 20 per cent.
  * 91 per cent (57,100) of clients leaving short-term Supporting People services established contact with external services/groups, as a proportion of those identifying a need. Under the previous method this would have been calculated as 88 per cent.
  * 91 per cent (35,800) of clients leaving short-term Supporting People services established contact with friends/family, as a proportion of those identifying a need. Under the previous method this would have been calculated as 55 per cent.

The key points from the latest release are:

Total revenue expenditure by local authorities in England was Â£99.9 billion in 2011-12, a decrease from Â£104.3 billion in 2010-11.
26.5 per cent of revenue expenditure in 2011-12 was funded through council tax, 29.5 per cent through formula grant and 46.5 per cent through specific grants inside Aggregate External Finance and Local Services Support Grant.
In 2011-12 local authorities added Â£2.6 billion to their reserves. This includes figures for Greater London Authority, who added Â£0.6 billion to their reserves. Excluding GLA, authorities added Â£2.0 billion to their reserves.
Local Authorities net current expenditure for education services was Â£40.2 billion in 2011-12.
Education expenditure for 2011-12 is not comparable to previous years due to a number of schools changing their status to become academies, which are centrally funded rather than funded by local authorities. There has also been a transfer of responsibilities between NHS and local government relating to adults with learning difficulties in long stay NHS institutions. As a result of this discontinuity between the two financial years (2010-11 & 2011-12), it is difficult to compare total net current expenditure.",,,30-Aug-12,statistics,statistics,,,making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/2207225.pdf,Local authority revenue expenditure and financing England: 2011-12 provisional outturn,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207240.xls,Table 1: Net current expenditure by service 2010-11 and 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207243.xls,Table 2: Revenue expenditure and financing 2010-11 and 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207248.xls,Table 3: Financing of revenue expenditure since 2006-07,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207253.xls,Table 4: Top five incomes from specific grants 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207258.xls,Table 5: Comparison of service expenditure and net current expenditure 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207263.xls,Annex A: Provisional Revenue Outturn Summary (RS) 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207268.xls,Annex B: Provisional Revenue Outturn Service Expenditure Summary (RSX) 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207274.xls,Annex C: Income from specific grants (RG) 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207283.xls,Annex D: Derivation of service lines used in Table 1,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2207290.xls,Annex E: Derivation of service lines used in Table 2,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/13241359.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Local authority revenue expenditure and financing England: Provisional outturn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our first report rightly focused on the most visible end of homelessness - those coming onto the streets, often facing advanced and overlapping problems such as offending, drug and alcohol addiction or mental health problems. We have made significant progress since then, driving forward the national roll out of the innovative rough sleeping approach called 'no second night out' and investing an extra Â£70 million through the sector to help tackle homelessness.

In this report we turn our attention up stream to think about how services can be managed in a way that prevents all households, regardless of whether they are families, couples, or single people, from reaching a crisis point where they are faced with homelessness.

This is the 4th year for which figures on homelessness prevention and relief have been published by the Department for Communities and Local Government under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.

Although the previous three releases were badged as 'experimental' official statistics in recognition that this is a relatively new data series, DCLG statisticians judge that the response rates and the quality of the figures received for 2011-12 have now improved enough for the 'experimental' label to now be removed.

The key points from the latest release are:

* in 2011-12, a total of 199,000 cases of homelessness prevention or relief are estimated to have taken place outside the statutory homelessness framework in England. Of these cases, 174,800 (88 per cent) were preventions and 24,200 (12 per cent) were cases of relief
* the total number of cases of homelessness prevention or relief increased by 5 per cent when compared to 2010-11. This is due to prevention cases increasing by 7 per cent, whilst cases of relief decreased by 2 per cent
* in 2011-12, 57 per cent of cases of homelessness prevention and relief involved the household being assisted to obtain alternative accommodation. The remaining 43 per cent involved the cases being assisted to remain in their existing home. This has not changed since 2010-11.
* the most common action taken to prevent or relieve homelessness was the use of landlord incentive schemes to secure private rented sector accommodation. In 2011-12, 27,600 cases (14 per cent) were assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation this way, though this was a decrease of 10 per cent compared to 2010-11
* the amount of homelessness prevention and relief activity varied across the regions. The North East had the highest rate of cases of prevention and relief with 11.8 cases per 1,000 households. The West Midlands (11.7 cases per 1,000 households), Yorkshire and the Humber (11.5) and the East Midlands (10.8) also had high rates of prevention and relief. The East of England, with 6.8 cases per 1,000 households, had the lowest rate.",Free,,16-Aug-12,statistics,statistics,,9781409836179,providing-housing-support-for-older-and-vulnerable-people,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/2199659.pdf,Homelessness Prevention and Relief: England 2011-12,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1393068.pdf,Pre-release Access list: Homelessness Prevention and Relief: England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Safer Places focuses on seven attributes of sustainability that are particularly relevant to crime prevention. The attributes are general and descriptive. They are not prescriptive. They are not a set of rules to be applied to all situations. Instead, they should be considered as prompts to thinking about crime prevention and promoting community safety through the planning system.

They recognise the important role of the private rented sector in providing accommodation for a diverse range of households. As part of this new approach, many local authorities are seeking to work with residential landlords and give them a stake in decisions that affect them. This is being done in a number of ways. For example, by offering landlords information that helps them to manage their properties better, by arranging meetings or forums where landlords can exchange views with local authority officers and, increasingly, by setting up voluntary accreditation schemes that recognise and reward landlords who manage their properties to a good standard.

This leaflet looks at the role of accreditation schemes for landlords, the benefits of joining one and where to find more information.
