Since theory tests began in 1996, the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) has published the questions and answers from the question banks for all categories of tests for cars, motorcycles, lorries and buses.

However, DSA announced last November that it was to stop publishing the multiple choice questions and answers, with unpublished questions being used from January 2012.

DSA's chief executive Rosemary Thew said: ""The reason behind the move is to stop candidates from simply memorising theory test questions and answers and learning by rote. The new books contain questions and answers for revision and also explain the theory behind each question.

>This approach to learning will help candidates to gain a better knowledge and understanding of driving theory which will help them respond correctly to the new, re-worded live questions used in the actual test.

Other theory test products including CD Roms, downloadable PDFs and ebooks have been revised too and will be published shortly after the theory test books are published on 19 September.

The agency has also launched its first ever mobile phone apps for theory test revision, which have been developed to help candidates learn in this way.",19-Sep-2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-roads-safer,driving-standards-agency,,

The Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. It's essential reading for everyone.

The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, particularly children, older or disabled people, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders.

It is important that all road users are aware of the code and are considerate towards each other. This applies to pedestrians as much as to drivers and riders.

Knowing and applying the rules contained in The Highway Code could significantly reduce road casualties. Cutting the number of deaths and injuries that occur on our roads every day is a responsibility we all share.",19-Dec-2011,making-roads-safer,,driving-standards-agency,,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dsa-news-20110506,Unofficial driving test booking websites,"Find out what you can do if you have used an unofficial driving test booking website, and what DSA is doing about unofficial sites.","Directgov is the only official driving test booking website.

Other websites offer driving test booking services, but might charge extra administrative fees on top of the Driving Standards Agency's (DSA) fee. Those websites are not run by or connected to DSA or Directgov.

DSA recommends that all learner drivers book their driving test through the official booking service on Directgov by visiting [direct.gov.uk/drivingtest.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/drivingtest)

## If you have used an unofficial website

DSA gets complaints from customers who have used unofficial booking websites. In most cases these websites are doing nothing illegal. This means that DSA's powers to respond may be limited.

If you have used an unofficial booking website, you might have seven working days to cancel your order and get all your money back. However, this will depend on the terms and conditions of the website you used.

You can find more information about your consumer rights on Directgov. You can also use template letters to complain to businesses. Each letter includes details of the law that you want the trader to follow.

## What DSA is doing about unofficial booking websites

DSA takes consumer protection very seriously. So, DSA is:

  * protecting its trademarks to make sure they are not:
    * used to advertise unofficial booking sites in search engine results
    * used as part of website addresses for unofficial booking websites
  * asking the Advertising Standards Authority to make sure unofficial booking websites are following the rules in the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing
  * asking local Trading Standards to investigate those unofficial booking websites that appear to be misleading consumers

## What DSA is doing to promote the official booking service

DSA makes improvements based on learner drivers' feedback to promote the official booking service. For example DSA:

  * made sure that the official Directgov website pages appear at the top of search engine results where possible
  * created videos showing how to use the practical test booking service - videos are being developed for the theory test booking service too
  * reminded learner drivers on Twitter and Facebook about using the official booking service on Directgov

## What approved driving instructors (ADIs) can do

DSA is encouraging ADIs to remind their trainees to use the official booking service by visiting **direct.gov.uk/drivingtest**.

If ADIs run their own websites they can also link to the official booking service. The best links to put on your website are:

  * [direct.gov.uk/booktheorytest](http://www.direct.gov.uk/booktheorytest) - Book an official DSA driving theory test
  * [direct.gov.uk/bookpracticaltest](http://www.direct.gov.uk/bookpracticaltest) - Book an official DSA practical driving test",6-May-2011,making-roads-safer,,driving-standards-agency,,
