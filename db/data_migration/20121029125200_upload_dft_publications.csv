http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/a14-ellington-to-fen-ditton-information-pack,A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton information pack,Information on the withdrawn A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton Scheme.,"## Information on the withdrawn A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton scheme

The A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton (A14efd) scheme was unaffordable and so was withdrawn in the 2010 Spending Review. The Highways Agency and the Department had gathered a large amount of information to support decision making about the scheme, and we are making this available to interested parties.

Most of the information is a combination of material prepared for the planned public inquiry, business case documents and traffic technical notes (known as TNs), which were intended to help inform the Business Case. We have selected some TNs we believe are particularly relevant, for instance because they were not able to be incorporated in the business case before the scheme was withdrawn. A full list of TNs is presented below, and all are available on request.

Also included is a briefing note on value management options. This was commissioned by officials due to the uncertainty about available funding for the scheme and it reviewed, at a very high level, the potential for finding lower cost alternative options. It noted that the statutory processes would need to be restarted if anything substantially different from the A14efd scheme was to be taken forward. The work was undertaken over a very short period and neither the officials nor the consultants involved intended the work to be used to form robust conclusions. No further work was undertaken. The briefing note also looked at options for reducing the cost of A14efd scheme.

In addition to this information the Department is also prepared to allow access to the modelling suite used to support the scheme, subject to the signings of an acceptable Memorandum of Understanding. A key element of this is that the Department and HA will not bear any costs for model development or model runs. If you are interested in pursuing this, or have any other queries, you should use the following contact email details: [joy.kabugu@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:joy.kabugu@dft.gsi.gov.uk)

The Department is taking forward a Joint Study with local partners on alternatives to the withdrawn scheme. This study will report in June 2012 and you may contribute any thoughts you have on alternatives to the withdrawn schemes to the A14 Study using the contact details above. The option generation and sifting phase will set the direction for the study, and this will take place in spring 2011. Any ideas received before this phase completes will have the greatest chance of influencing the study.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/access-for-all-mid-tier-funding,Access for all mid-tier funding,The Access for All funding is a key part of the government's strategy to improve the accessibility of Great Britain's railway.,"Access for All funding is a key part of the government's strategy to improve the accessibility of Great Britain's railway. This funding is specifically targeted at providing infrastructure improvements at stations which will enable more disabled people to access the rail network.

In April this year we invited bids for a new programme of Access for All Mid-Tier programme for station access projects requiring between £250,000 and £1,000,000 of government support.

The Access for All Programme is part of the Railways for All Strategy, launched in 2006 to address the issues faced by disabled passengers using railway stations in Great Britain. Central to the Strategy is the ring-fencing of £35m funding per year, until 2015, for provision of an obstacle free, accessible route to and between platforms at priority stations. This generally includes the provision of lifts or ramps, as well as associated works and refurbishment along the defined route.

## List of Access for All stations

The following tables list the stations in England, Wales and Scotland to which the Department for Transport has targeted Access for All funding, subject to Network Rail carrying out a feasibility study to identify how access can be improved. This process will include engagement with relevant stakeholders to ensure that the most appropriate solution can be delivered within the objectives of the Access for All Programme.

All passenger train station operators are encouraged to use the document, and those who are licensed must follow its standards. Accessible Train Station Design for Disabled people: A Code of Practice Version 01, published in July 2008, replaced the previous version published by the Strategic Rail Authority, and incorporated a clearer structure, more-up-to-date guidance, and standards mirroring new European rules.

This new Version 03 of the Code of Practice (valid from November 2011) replaces all previous versions. It provides standards and guidance for accessibility at railway stations, updated to more accurately reflect the BS8300 changes in 2009, and should be used by all train and station operators whenever they carry out works on their facilities.

The interests of passengers and airlines are likely to be relatively well aligned. However, the duty for airlines to maximise future profits means that there can be no automatic presumption that in all circumstances airlines' and passengers' interests will be aligned.

Amongst the key circumstances in which there may be a misalignment of interests are when:

  * Airlines have market power.
  * Developments that may increase the degree of competition are being contemplated.
  * Airports being used by airlines are subject to economic regulation.

The Transport Act 2000 requires the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), when exercising its air navigation functions, to take account of environmental Guidance given to it by the Secretary of State.  The current Guidance was issued in 2002 by the then Department for Transport, Local government and Regions.

Given the length of time since the Guidance was published, and the recommendations of Sir Joseph Pilling in his July 2008 strategic review of the CAA and the Transport Select Committee in its 2009 report on the Use of Airspace, the government recognises the need to update the Guidance to reflect current government policy, including on issues such as noise and climate change. This will be done following development of the _Sustainable Framework for UK Aviation_ and will include a public consultation.

In the interim, the Department for Transport is publishing a technical addendum to the Guidance.  This addendum updates references and lists relevant policy documents and legislation published since 2002 that the CAA takes into account when considering airspace change proposals.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/alternatives-to-travel-public-sector,Alternatives to travel in the public sector,Documents concerning alternatives to travel in the public sector.,"## Summary

Reducing the need to travel is an important objective in the public sector. The potential for cost savings and carbon efficiencies by avoiding travel, in favour of alternatives such as telephone conferencing or home working are well recognised, although the exact levels of savings in relation to the cost incurred when providing for these alternatives are less well understood.

In 2011 the Department for Transport (DfT) funded the Alternatives to Travel (ATT) support programme for public sector organisations. The programme, delivered from July 2011 to March 2012, helped four local authorities (Cheshire West and Chester Council, Dorset County Council, Kent County Council and Swindon Borough Council) to progress their ATT agendas to affect work related journeys, and understand more about the potential cost and carbon savings that could be achieved. All of the local authorities have been able to demonstrate cost and carbon benefits of ATT through reduced travel due to increased use of ATT measures.

For the purposes of this programme ATT measures included: home working and remote working, flexible working and staggered hours, teleconferencing, videoconferencing (including tele-presence) and web conferencing for the purpose of travelling to, and for, work. The summary report provides an overview of the work undertaken.

The case study report details the work that was undertaken at each public sector organisation and the impact of the ATT measures implemented.

The guidance document provides tools which will assist other organisations to implement ATT measures. These tools are transferable to public sector as well as private sector organisations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/behavioural-insights-toolkit,Behavioural insights toolkit,How behavioural insights can be applied in the transport context to achieve policy objectives.,"## Foreword by Deirdre O'Reilly, Head of Social Research and Evaluation Division, Department for Transport

Behavioural insights are an important component of the Department's vision for a transport system that is an engine for economic growth but one that is also greener and safer and improves quality of life in our communities.

The behavioural insights toolkit provides a readily digestible and user-friendly guide to those responsible for transport policy and delivery initiatives, including local authorities. The toolkit shows how behavioural insights can be applied in the transport context to achieve policy objectives. The toolkit does not represent mandatory guidance and its use is purely voluntary.

The Department would welcome feedback from local authorities and others on their experiences of using the toolkit to support the development of transport policy and delivery initiatives. Please send any thoughts, comments or queries you have about the toolkit to [behavioural.insights@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:behavioural.insights@dft.gsi.gov.uk)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/biofuel-research,Biofuel research,"Research on renewable fuels, particularly biofuels, to ensure that there is a robust evidence base for government policy.","## Summary

The Department for Transport commissions research on renewable fuels, particularly biofuels, to ensure that there is a robust evidence base for government policy. This research covers the full life of biofuels from their production, both in the UK and overseas, to their use in vehicles. Details on recent research projects are given below.

## 2012

  * [Biofuel effects on diesel performance, emissions and economy in conventional and advanced technologies (PDF 2113 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/biofuels/biofuel-effects-on-diesel-performance.pdf).  
This report considers the effects of biodiesel from a number of different feedstocks and blend strengths on the performance of a typical diesel engine and how optimising engine calibration to run on these fuels might change these effects.

## 2011

### Modes research

The following suite of research projects investigates the potential supply of sustainable biofuels through to 2050 and the cost and barriers of a range of options for using these biofuels in the transport sector.

  * [Scenarios for the cost effective deployment of biofuel in the UK road transport sector in 2020 (PDF 1131 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/biofuels/modes-3.pdf).  
This report presents the key findings of the research. It is strongly recommended that readers begin with this report.
  * [Assessment of the existing UK infrastructure capacity and vehicle fleet capability for the use of biofuels (PDF, 1847 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/biofuels/biofuels-infrastructure-vehicle-report.pdf).  
This report provides a comprehensive review of the level of biofuel use that is compatible with vehicles and infrastructure, in 2010, across road, rail, aviation and shipping. This work provided input data to the scenarios developed for the main report.
  * [Development of illustrative scenarios describing the quantity of different types of bioenergy potentially available to the UK transport sector in 2020, 2030 and 2050 (PDF, 658 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/biofuels/modes-1.pdf).  
This research provides scenarios for the potential supply of sustainable biofuels. The report was designed as input for the main report and is not recommended for use in other contexts.

Note on revisions: The Department intends to update these reports to reflect the latest projections for fossil fuel and biofuel prices. Updated reports, and a further analysis of biofuel use across transport modes over the period to 2050, will be published once these revisions are complete.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/bus-coach-accessibility-faqs,"Bus, coach accessibility FAQ",Frequently asked questions relating to buses- coaches and accessibility.,"## When will all buses and coaches meet the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR)?

[PSVAR](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/buses/pubs/psvar/accessibilityregulations20005993.html) (as amended) applies to all new public service vehicles (buses or coaches) introduced since 31 December 2000 with a capacity exceeding 22 passengers used to provide a local or scheduled service.

## Do the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR) apply to the UK as a whole?

PSVAR (as amended) applies in England, Scotland and Wales and are the responsibility of the Department for Transport's Mobility & Inclusion Unit. Northern Ireland has introduced separate regulations (these are the responsibility of theDepartment for Regional Development).

## When will all buses and coaches meet the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR)?  


**All** full size single deck buses over 7.5 tonnes will be fully accessible from 1 January 2016, and all double deck buses from 1 January 2017. **New** buses weighing up to 7.5 tonnes and coaches will be required to have wheelchair access from 1 January 2005. **All** buses weighing up to 7.5 tonnes will be fully accessible from 1 January 2015 and **coaches** by 1 January 2020.

## What has been done to improve access to bus services for disabled people?

The powers in Part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) allow the government to make regulations requiring all new land-based public transport vehicles - trains, taxis, buses and coaches - to be accessible to disabled people, including those who need to remain in wheelchairs. The regulations that govern access to service buses and coaches are known as the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR). The PSVAR have been applied to all new buses and coaches which carry more than 22 passengers and are used on local or scheduled services since 31 December 2000.

Information about how we are making other forms of [transport accessible is available here](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/dft.gov.uk/topics/access/buses-and-coaches/)

## What measures have been taken to encourage local authorities and bus companies to introduce low floor buses?

In recent years low floor buses have been introduced in increasing numbers. This change was promoted both by the Department, through a series of research and demonstration projects, and by our statutory advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC).

The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR) do allow for high floor vehicles, but bus operators and manufacturers of full size single deck and double deck buses have, by and large, opted for low floor vehicles.

Over one third of full size local buses are now low floor vehicles rising to over 80 per cent in major urban areas. 90 per cent of the London fleet comprises low floor vehicles.

## Some bus drivers are reluctant to put the ramp down or kneel the bus what do the regulations say about this?

The Public Service Vehicles (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers (Amendment) Regulations 2002 have, since 1 October 2002, required the bus driver or conductor to provide reasonable assistance to disabled people, including wheelchair users, to board and alight.

Please note that these regulations only apply to vehicles which are regulated under the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR), but we strongly recommend that bus operators adopt those practices for all their accessible buses.

We have produced guidance to help both [manufacturers and operators](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/transportforyou-access-buses-pubs-conduct/sstopublicservicevehicle5990.pdf) and [drivers](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/buses/pubs/conduct/conductofdriversinspectorsan5991.html) to understand their new duties and there is an NVQ module covering disability awareness training for bus drivers introduced by GoSkills (the Sector Skills Council for Passenger Transport). It is clearly in the best interests both of the bus driver and the passenger if the driver is fully aware of the needs of his disabled passengers and how to respond to them. However, the regulations do allow the driver to refuse to help you if doing so would adversely affect his health or safety, your safety or that of other passengers or the safety of the vehicle.

## How can I find out if my wheelchair is suitable to use on buses?

The Department for Transport commissioned Ricability to produce a guide, Wheels within Wheels, which outlines what wheelchair users can expect from newer trains, coaches, buses and taxis. It has information on how passengers can find out where accessible services are running and gives tips on travelling in a wheelchair. In addition, it also lists the key dimensions of the wheelchairs currently available in the United Kingdom, and which of those will fit onto public transport.

## Why am I unable to take my electric scooter on a bus or coach?

None of the regulations for buses or coaches deal with the carriage of scooters. This is because scooters are outdoor vehicles intended for use as an alternative to public transport for short trips. They are generally less manoeuvrable than wheelchairs and cannot be used as a seat on a vehicle because of their instability and difficulty in providing appropriate restraint systems for the both the scooter and the user.

## Who should I contact if I have a complaint?

You should contact the appropriate bus operating company or, in the case of London,[Transport for London](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/). If this does not prove satisfactory, then you can contact Bus Users UK, an independent body set up to ensure bus passengers have a voice with the industry (Scotland has its own Bus Users Complaints Tribunal) or, for transport in London, the London Transport Users Committee.

## Does PSVAR apply to coaches that are used for leisure excursions?

PSVAR only applies to new public service vehicles with a carrying capacity of more than 22 passengers that are used on local or scheduled services and have been introduced into service since 31 December 2000. Proposals for access to other services and for small vehicles (with 22 passengers or less) will be subject to further consideration and consultation.

## When will there be audible and visual announcements on buses?

Trials of audible and visual announcements on buses in Leeds during 2001 showed that their introduction on buses, whilst well received by passengers, did present some technical challenges.  We are monitoring the progress of new technologies designed to address these issues and regularly review how best to ensure the wider adoption of such systems within the UK bus fleet.

## Where can I find guidance on how to make my buses and coaches comply with accessibility regulations?

The regulations that govern access to service buses and coached are known as the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR). The regulations apply to all new buses and coaches introduced into service since 31 December 2000 with a capacity of more than 22 passengers and used on local or scheduled services.

We have published for vehicle manufacturers and operators to assist in meeting the regulations. Please note, however, that the guidance does not replace nor does it qualify the regulations in any way, and in every case reference should be made to the relevant provisions of the PSVAR themselves to determine the precise extent of the legal requirements.

## Are exemptions available?

Under Section 43 of the DDA 1995 the Secretary of State may authorise, by means of a special authorisation order, the use of a regulated public service vehicle which does not comply with accessibility regulations. It is important to note that a vehicle which does not meet all of the requirements of the accessibility regulations cannot be issued with an accessibility certificate.

Before a special authorisatioin order is issued it will normally be necessary for a full accessibility inspection to be carried out. A vehicle will have to comply fully with accessibility regulations apart from those items for which a special authorisation is granted.

Detailed guidance on applying for special authorisation orders has been produced. Manufacturers and operators are advised to read this before submitting an application for a special authorisation order.

The Department has adopted the following input and impact indicators, listed by Coalition priority, as set out in our [Business plan](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-business-plan/). Input indicators show the cost to the government of delivering certain products and services. Impact indicators show the performance or output of public services. These indicators aim to provide useful information to enable transport users and the wider public to make informed choices, and to make up their own minds about how the Department and transport service operators are running.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/business-plan-qds,Business plan quarterly data summary (QDS),"A quarterly snapshot on how each department is spending its budget, the results it has achieved and how it is deploying its workforce.","## Summary

The QDS is designed to fit on a single page to provide a quarterly snapshot on how each department is spending its budget, the results it has achieved and how it is deploying its workforce.

The QDS follows commitments made at Budget 2011 and the Written Ministerial Statement on Business Plans. Its primary purpose is to make more of the management information currently held by government available to members of the public on a regular basis.

We intend that an annual version of this information be formally laid in Parliament in the Annual Report and Accounts for July 2011/12 onwards.

The information is presented in excel format to allow the information to be presented in a re-usable format.

The QDS template is the same for all departments, though many of the individual indicators are unique to the department (especially input and impact indicators).

People should be cautious using this data to make comparisons between departments for several reasons. Firstly, the business of each department is unique and it does not make sense to compare some measures across all departments. Secondly, many of the measures are not directly comparable because they do not have common definitions, time periods, or data collection processes. Therefore, before using this data people should ensure they take full note of the caveats included in each department's measurement annex.

Over time we will be making improvements to the data quality and timeliness so that the public will be able to judge the performance of each department in an increasingly meaningful and understandable manner.

We will be updating the QDS each quarter with the next publication following in October 2012.

## Background information

The Business Plan Quarterly Data Summary (QDS) has been developed to report departmental performance and allow comparison between departments. The QDS is divided into three sections: Spending, Results and People. Spending includes information on expenditure on major projects, and Common Areas of Spend, such as estate and IT costs. Results focuses on data relevant to the DfT Business Plan, including input and impact indicators and Structural Reform Plan commitments, and the People section provides data on the DfT workforce, including data on staff within DfT's executive agencies.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/cabin-air-quality-faqs,Cabin air quality FAQ,Concerns have been raised in the media about the possibility of air crew and passengers being exposed to toxins in cabin air. The Department for Transport,"Concerns have been raised in the media about the possibility of air crew and passengers being exposed to fumes in cabin air. The Department for Transport (DfT) has received a number of enquiries, and these are our answers to the most Frequently Asked Questions. There is more information on the website of the Committee on Toxicity.

## Is aircraft cabin air contaminated?

Studies such as the European CabinAir project have shown that normally the levels of chemical and biological contaminants in aircraft are less than in many work environments such as office buildings.

There are, however, occasional bad smells or 'fume events' during flights, and these have been reported on a number of aircraft types which are in use around the world. Reports to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) show that sometimes one pilot reports a bad smell and the other detects nothing. An unpleasant smell is undesirable but does not necessarily harm health. Conversely carbon monoxide has no smell yet kills people in the home every year.

Some pilots who have experienced these events report a variety of short or long term symptoms or ill health. But it is not certain that these symptoms are work related.

The independent Committee on Toxicity (a panel including toxicologists from various universities - and known as COT) completed a substantial review of evidence in September 2007 and concluded that the evidence available did not establish a link between cabin air and pilot ill health, but nor did it rule one out.

## What has the Government done?

Both the COT and the House of Lords Committee on Science & Technology identified a gap in the world's knowledge. The Government has tried to fill that gap through research. No-one had previously captured samples of cabin air during normal conditions and fume events and analysed them to see what substances they contain and in what concentrations. The science is difficult because fume events are unpredictable and can last just a couple of minutes.

To fill the knowledge gap the DfT put 4 research studies in hand. All have been completed and the Department's programme in this area has now stopped. In summary we have:

  * commissioned and completed functionality tests to identify scientific equipment capable of capturing fume events in real time. The report was published by Cranfield University in February 2008. 
    * [Aircraft Functionality Test Report](https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/2389)
  * commissioned and completed an exploratory data analysis study of fume events and operational parameters - especially whether there is any link between ""full power take-offs"" and fume events. The report was published by Cranfield University in December 2009. Its conclusion was that - data obtained in this way could be used to support engineering discussions about how to anticipate and possibly mitigate event occurrence. It may be that oil pressures, duct temperatures and engine power would merit further investigation.
  * commissioned and completed real time in-flight testing, using the scientific equipment and methodology tested earlier, to assemble data on substances in cabin air. This is the main cabin air study and was conducted by Cranfield University. Several airlines volunteered to take part by allowing an independent scientist to come on board their aircraft with sampling equipment. Testing began in 2008 and finished in 2010. The report was peer reviewed over the winter of 2010/2011 and published by Cranfield University in May 2011. 
    * [Aircraft Cabin Air Sampling Study; Part 1 of the final report](https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/5305)
    * [Aircraft Cabin Air Sampling Study; Part 2 of the final report](https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/5306)
  * commissioned and completed swab test research into the prevalence of isomers of TCP (organophosphates) on surfaces in aircraft and non-aircraft locations for comparison. The report was published by the Institute of Occupational Medicine in June 2012. 
    * [IOM Swab Test Research](http://www.iom-world.org/pubs/IOM_TM1106.pdf)

## Who did the research?

Three of the research studies were conducted by Cranfield University; the fourth was conducted by the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) in Edinburgh.

## What did the main Cranfield report say?

The main message from the principal research study is that, with respect to the conditions of flight that were experienced during the study, there was no evidence for target pollutants occurring in the cabin air at levels exceeding available health and safety standards and guidelines. Moreover, levels observed were comparable to those typically experienced in domestic settings.

The study monitored a total of 100 flights in five different aircraft types, Boeing 757, Airbus 319, 320 and 321 and the BAe 146. A series of air samples were taken at defined points on all flights, and all flight crew, cabin crew and researchers were also requested to complete a post-flight questionnaire including questions about any fumes or smells that occurred during the flight.

The study's objective was to analyse cabin air for volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, particles and carbon monoxide in normal operations during all phases of flight (e.g. climb, cruise, descent), and to detect and characterise any anomalous elevations of these elements during any 'fume events' where unusual smells or similar occurrences were reported.

The European standard 'Aircraft internal air quality standards, criteria and determination methods' sets safety, health and comfort limits for a number of substances, including two that were measured in the study - carbon monoxide and toluene. The study's results indicate that concentrations of both carbon monoxide and toluene remained within these limits. In the absence of specific cabin air standards for the other pollutants measured in the study, the study referred to other standards and guidelines established, for example, for domestic (home) or occupational environments. Again, none of these standards or guidelines was exceeded.

## What happens now the projects have reported?

The Department for Transport has formally submitted them to the COT for consideration.

## How frequent are fume events?

The COT estimated in 2007 that fume events occur on roughly 0.05% of flights overall (1 in 2000). The most recent figures show that in 2010 there were 207 contaminated air events reported to the CAA mandatory reporting scheme (MORS) out of 1.12 million passenger and cargo flights by UK carriers (0.018%). Not all fume events are reported, but even if the number was doubled or tripled this would still be a very small proportion.

## How many passengers have been affected?

There are very few passenger complaints about health issues to airlines or the authorities.

CAA figures from 2011 showed that out of a total of 48,000 written complaints in the 10 years from January 2001, 244 (0.5%) were categorised as medical. The main health problems raised were pregnancy issues; ski-ing injuries; infectious diseases; allergies (typically from peanuts); food poisoning and passengers being scalded by coffee/tea.

## Why not just fit filters to aircraft?

DfT has discussed this with a major filter manufacturer who said that, to produce an effective filtration system, they would first need to know what particular substance had to be filtered out. That is why it is logical to analyse cabin air first, to identify what remedy might be needed.

Compulsory fitting of filters would have to be required by regulators (in this case the European Aviation Safety Agency - EASA) on the basis of evidence that cabin air contains a particular substance in a harmful concentration and that a particular specification of filter could remove that substance. It is important to remember that the same aircraft types are flown world wide.

## Why do fume events happen?

In any mechanical system malfunctions can occur which result in abnormal operating conditions. The CAA has already taken remedial action to help operators of particular aircraft reduce the incidence of fume events e.g. engine oil servicing procedures and engine sealing modifications.

## Should there be a public enquiry?

There have already been 2 public enquiries:

First, in 2006/7 when the Committee on Toxicity - an independent advisory panel of toxicologists - was commissioned to look into the evidence on the subject. The COT reported in 2007 and found that no connection between pilot ill health and cabin air could be proved or disproved, but that more research was needed. That research has been completed and the DfT has now formally reported back to the COT.

Second, in 2007/8 when the issue was revisited by the House of Lords Committee on Science and Technology. The Committee urged the Government to complete the air sampling research. This was done and the research was published by Cranfield University in May 2011.

## Are there organophosphates in cabin air?

With regard to organophosphates the Cranfield University report notes that

> ""in over 95% of the cabin air samples, no detectable amounts of TOCP or other TCPs were found. TBP was detected more routinely, but not in the majority of samples. The highest level of TBP recorded was 21.8 µg m-3 (overall mean 1.07 µg m-3) which exceeds any reported domestic indoor air level. TBP levels were highest during first engine start.""

TBP is an element in aircraft hydraulic fluid so it is not surprising that it would not usually be found in domestic air. The measurement µg.m-3 is ""micrograms per cubic metre"" - the mass of something in micrograms (i.e. 0.000001 grams) in a given volume (one cubic metre) of air. It represents an extremely small amount - most exposure limits are expressed as mg.m-3 or milligrams (0.001 grams) per cubic metre which is 1000 times greater. It is the concentration of a substance which determines its health effect.

## Why not use engine oil containing no TCP?

TCP is an organophosphate. Organophosphates are anti-wear agents and are used as aviation lubricants to make engines safe. Although there is a lubricant on the market which uses an alternative organophosphate to TCP, according to the manufacturer it is not typically used in civil aviation and research about its health impacts is not conclusive. So we do not know if it would be safer or healthier.

## Will you do an epidemiological study?

The logical first step in the research programme was to examine potential exposure as recommended by the COT. That is what the Cranfield study has done. The COT said epidemiological research would best be done on an international basis. The scale of pilots and control group needed for reliable results would be large. It is unlikely that the UK could fund such a study. We are also aware that it could be difficult to recruit pilots, who in the UK would be legally obliged to report any health impairments found (whether related or not to cabin air) to the CAA who licenses them.

## Transverse TSIs (including downloads)

So called 'transverse' TSIs potentially apply to all subsystems of both the High Speed and Conventional rail systems. Contracting Entities will need to consider their applicability to each and every project. Transverse TSIs apply to both high speed and conventional networks.

  * [Safety in railway tunnels (SRT)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:064:0001:0071:EN:PDF)
  * [Accessibility for persons with reduced mobility (PRM)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:064:0072:0207:EN:PDF)

These TSIs came into force in the UK on 1 July 2008.

The existing domestic accessibility regimes (the [Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (RVAR)](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/access/rail/rail-vehicles/#) and the Train and Station Services for Disabled Passengers - A Code of Practice) have been amended to reflect the incoming PRM TSI. To avoid dual regulation of heavy rail vehicles by domestic and European accessibility regimes, [the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2008](http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081746_en.pdf) came into force on 7 July. These regulations remove those trains used on the interoperable rail system from the scope of RVAR although there remains a requirement for train operators to maintain their vehicles to the standards to which they were built, ie RVAR. They also set an ""end date"", of 1 January 2020, by which time all heavy rail vehicles must be accessible.

RVAR continues to apply to light rail (metro, underground and tram) services such as the Docklands Light Railway and London Underground.

## High Speed TSIs (including downloads)

The first High Speed TSIs became effective on 30 November 2002. A process of review and revision has been under way for some time.

Revised High Speed TSIs are now emerging from the revision process, being notified to Member States and published in the Official Journal. Until such time as the OJ versions are available, we will, as quickly as possible, include them below.

## **CoCoSig TSIs**

Please note that, although the CoCoSig TSI itself has not been revised (please see the 2002 list below for a link to the original HS CCS TSI), there have been three modifications to Annex A, as follows:

  * [High Speed Command Control and Signalling TSI second modification to amended Annex A (2007/386) - (PDF, 44KB)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:067:0013:0017:EN:PDF)

  * [High Speed Command Control and Signalling TSI second modification to amended Annex A (2008/386/EC) - (PDF)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:136:0011:0017:EN:PDF)

Any Contracting Entity to whose project a revised High Speed TSI may apply, whether that contract is in the course of performance or in the preparatory stages, should consult with their NoBo and if necessary with the Competent Authority (DfT in Great Britain, the Department for Regional Development Northern Ireland for Northern Ireland) to clarify how this will affect their project, and should consider what derogations they may need to seek.

The new ATOL regulations were laid before Parliament on the 4th April and will come into force on the 30th April 2012.

Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that there are a number of errors in these regulations. Although these are minor in nature and do not affect the main aspects of the ATOL reforms, they do need to be corrected to ensure the ATOL Regulations 2012 can be interpreted properly as soon as they come into force.

These changes will be made through the Civil Aviation (Air Travel Organisers' Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2012, which were laid before Parliament on 25 April and will come into effect on 29 April so the ATOL Regulations 2012 are corrected before they come into force.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/climate-change-transport-choices-segmentation,Climate change and transport choices: segmentation study final report,This report outlines a segmentation of public attitudes to climate change and transport choices.,"## Foreword by Deirdre O'Reilly, Head of Social Research and Evaluation Division

Behavioural insights are an important component of the Department for Transport vision for a transport system that is an engine for economic growth but one that is also greener and safer and improves quality of life in our communities.

Social Research and Evaluation (SRE) division has an important role in providing an evidence base to improve the Department's understanding of public attitudes and behaviours in relation to climate change and the motivators and barriers to more sustainable travel choices. This work has previously included:

  * An [evidence base review](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/climatechange/iewofpublicattitudestocl5730.pdf) (Anable et al, 2006) which reviewed the existing evidence and made recommendations for further research
  * An [18-month deliberative study](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/social/climatechange/) (King et al, 2009) which explored existing barriers and incentives to behavioural change and explored the impact of providing information (especially scientific information) to members of the public

The latest study in the Department's research programme has segmented the adult (age 16 and over) population of England in terms of both attitudes to climate change and also actual transport behaviours. The study has included a robust large-scale survey of the general public, the findings from which were published in an [interim report](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/climate-change-and-transport-choices) and accompanying dataset in December 2010.

This final report from that study presents the segmentation model. In total, nine distinct segments or groups have been defined according to their transport behaviour, attitudes to transport, attitudes to climate change and the environment, characteristics and circumstances. 

The segmentation model provides a useful framework for policy makers, local authorities and other external bodies in delivering evidence based sustainable transport initiatives. In particular, the model identifies: 

  * Which policy options practitioners could consider as potentially effective with each segment, and which may be seen as less effective
  * How practitioners could see particular motivators and barriers to more sustainable transport behaviours as more or less relevant for work with each segment
  * How practitioners could see particular segments as priorities in relation to reducing the overall emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from transport in their local area. 

The report includes advice on replicating the segments using a small set of 'Golden Questions'. Local authorities and others may wish to use these as part of further research to identify which segments predominate in their local areas. This in turn may help them to identify which initiatives are more (or less) likely to be effective at enabling and encouraging more sustainable transport behaviour in their local areas.

## Transcript

With a week of activities around the country, climate week is inspiring everyone to think about how they can help prevent climate change, because if we don't act and act now, the consequences for humanity are potentially catastrophic. And that's why the Department for Transport is very focused on meeting government targets for reducing greenhouse gases, which are to cut them by 50% from 1990 levels by 2027 - and 80% by 2050.

Given transport is responsible for around a quarter of UK domestic carbon emissions, these are tough challenges to meet, especially as we still need cars, vans trucks, trains and planes to move people and goods around and sustain growth. But we're committing a lot of money to solutions that will mitigate the climate change impacts from transport.

For example, we're putting £400 million into electric and low carbon vehicles. Cars powered by electric batteries and hybrid technology are already a reality on the UK's streets. Anyone purchasing an electric car can benefit from a government subsidy of up to £5,000 towards its cost.

And we recently launched our new [Plug-in Van Grant](/topics/sustainable/olev/plug-in-van-grant/), so electric van man or indeed woman, can now receive 20% - up to £8,000 - off the cost of plug-in vans.

And, alongside the vehicles, a network of charge points are springing up around the country, backed by private and public sector support, making it even easier for people to switch to low-carbon vehicles.

We're also supporting the use of sustainable biofuels so that vehicles powered by the traditional internal combustion engine become less greenhouse-gas-intensive in the future.

But this isn't just about cars. In towns and cities across England we're helping to fund hundreds of [Green Buses](/topics/public-transport/buses/green-bus-fund/) that emit nearly a third less carbon than their conventional counterparts.

And, by backing a new high speed rail route from London to Birmingham with future extensions to Manchester and Leeds, we believe significant numbers of long distance journeys could be switched from road to rail.

Of course, there's plenty more that can be done to bring our existing infrastructure up to scratch. So we're ""greening"" our railways - replacing diesel trains by electrifying key lines and reducing power consumption per train.

In turn, our commitment to the EU's emissions trading system means the aviation industry has to keep emissions below a fixed limit or pay for extra cuts to be made elsewhere.

At the local level of course it's local people not central government who are in the best position to know what travel alternatives would suit the area where they live.

That's why our £560m [Local Sustainable Transport Fund](/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process) is giving local authorities the power to bid for the schemes that are right for them - whether that's enhancing light rail facilities:improving routes for walking:or providing cycle paths.

Importantly, not only does this funding provide communities with better transport connections, they also give people genuine low-carbon travel choices.

And finally, we're encouraging business to think about alternatives to travel, whether it's enabling people to work away from their offices or cutting out unnecessary business journeys by using technology like video conferencing to link people in different parts of the country.

Every government department is engaged in thinking through the carbon impact of its policies and devising new ways of cutting emissions whether its in industry or power generation. And as you can see, the Department for Transport is playing its part, working very hard to maintain our lifestyles and develop growth, whilst at the same time tackling climate change impacts.",promotional-material,reducing-co2-and-other-emissions-from-transport,improving-local-transport,,department-for-transport,,,,12-Mar-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Narrator:** To counter the perception of HMEP being just a passing government 'fad', something that would peter out as quickly as it came about, Norman Baker, Minister for Local & Regional Transport, has committed the Department to the programme up to 2018, a move warmly welcomed by the sector, no more so than by Hampshire's Chief Executive, Andrew Smith.

**Andrew Smith:** I understand resources for it are being extended, I think this gives local government a chance to step up to the plate. I think the public has a high expectation that we'll come together with partners, work with Whitehall and also engage with the private sector in doing the best for our communities. I think that's what the expectation is I think this programme gives us the benefit to do that. I think a ministerial initiative at this level that trying to bring together a significant number of local authorities to work in a collaborative way definitely helps when there is both Whitehall and ministerial support for that style of working.

**Narrator:** This sentiment has been echoed by the HTMA as its chair Philip Hoare explains.

**Philip Hoare:** I really welcome the commitment of the DfT that is being put into the HMEP programme. I think that one of our initial concerns was how we'd actually deliver within a two year programme, particularly when you think about some of the cultural change aspects that I think are required to ensure things are fully embedded. So we absolutely welcome the news to extend the programme to 2018 and certainly the HTMA will remain absolutely committed to that programme throughout its duration. And hopefully what we can create is a long lasting community that ensures we're constantly striving for innovation and improvement in the highways sector.

**David Hodge:** Highways is a key area where all local authorities struggle up and down the country and we believe that by setting out clear objectives, a clear identity of what we wanted to achieve by working together, we now know we can deliver much better quality services, but at a lower cost and therefore it means we can do much more work to ensure the residents receive the benefit.

**Philip Hoare:** I firmly believe as the HTMA organisation, that we can, working with everyone across the sector deliver some real tangible savings. In figures we talked about a range of 20 - 30% and we believe those figures are achievable. It'll be tough, it won't be easy to drive that sort of cost out, but I think everybody recognises the challenge and importantly we're really up for it.

The Department has formally designated thirty two lines or services.

Designation encourages appropriate standards and excludes the lines from some elements of EU regulation. It provides a more flexible approach to the management of the franchise and allows more flexible arrangements on timetables and fares for example. Designation reinforces the importance and status of the Community Rail Partnership for the line. Designation of services serves similar ends but does not include track or signaling.

Designation follows a consultation process with key local and rail industry stakeholders and endorsement by the National Community Rail Development Implementation Steering Group.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/conditions-of-eligibility-psv360-for-bus-service-operators-grant,Conditions of Eligibility (PSV360) for Bus Service Operators Grant,A brief description of the conditions of eligibility for the BSOG.,"This information sheet contains a brief description of the Conditions of Eligibility for the Bus Service Operators Grant. This information sheet is for guidance only; full conditions of eligibility for Bus Service Operators' Grant are contained within the Bus Service Operators Grant (England) Regulations 2002 statutory instrument No. 2002/1015 (equivalent regulations are in place in Scotland and Wales) and are printed in full on the reverse of the estimated claim form (PSV310) and certified claim form (PSV311).

## Conditions of eligibility

To qualify for rebate a bus service must be a **local bus service** or, in London, **a service run under the London local service permit or exempt from the need to have such a licence**.

## Other conditions

Local services (other than schools services and those for elderly or disabled - see below) will qualify for rebate if:

**A)** at least half the accommodation on the vehicle by means of which the service is provided is normally available to members of the general public and the service is regularly used by such members;

**B)** the stopping arrangements are such that -

  * all the fixed stopping places (whether marked or otherwise generally recognised) are located where they are likely to be used with reasonable frequency by members of the general public, and
  * in any section of the area of operation of the service where there are no fixed stopping places, the arrangements for determining when and where passengers may be taken up and set down are such that members of the general public may take advantage of them with reasonable frequency;

**C)** members of the general public are able to make a single journey between two stopping places (to the extent that such journeys are provided for in the registered particulars having regard to boarding and alighting restrictions) upon payment of a fare that is not a deliberate deterrent to their use of their service,

  * in the case of a flexible service, the advanced booking arrangements are such that they do not act as a deterrent to members of the general public wishing to make a single journey which is otherwise provided for in the particulars of registration;

**D)** members of the general public are able to pay the fare at a place and in a manner that are not a deliberate deterrent to their use of the service;

**E)** there is not displayed on the vehicle by means of which the service is provided any sign or description intended or likely to convey the impression that the service is only available to a particular category of person;

**F)** arrangements are made which afford members of the general public a reasonable opportunity to inform themselves of the existence of the service, times of its operation and the places which it serves.

The above regulations reflect the introduction of new rules regarding demand responsive and flexibly routed services with effect from 23rd February 2004. Operators of local bus services in England may now claim Bus Service Operators' Grant for demand responsive and flexibly routed services provided they are registered with the relevant Traffic Area Office as such. These regulations were amended by the Bus Service Operators' Grant (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2004, Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 9.

Such routes may only be claimed for on a **PSV311** certified claim form.

Similar arrangements have come into force in Wales with effect from 31st July 2004. This is stipulated by the Bus Service Operators' Grant (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2004, Welsh Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 1827 (W.203).

These arrangements do not apply in Scotland. Demand responsive and flexibly routed services do not qualify for Bus Service Operators' Grant in Scotland.

**The main exceptions** to these conditions are bus services provided or secured:

  1. by education authorities under section 509 of the Education Act 1996 or, in Scotland, section 51 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980;
  2. for persons who are sixty years or older or who are disabled.

These services must meet **conditions A** to **F** except that:

  * they will qualify provided that **some** seats are available to the general public and the service is regularly used by the public;
  * the stopping places to or from which the service is mainly provided (for example, a school) need not be used by the public;
  * **condition e.** will not apply.

## Other exceptions

Excursions and tours will not qualify for Bus Service Operators Grant ('excursion' or 'tour' means a service on which all the passengers travel together on a return journey).

Services using vehicles designed to carry eight people or less will qualify **only** if they satisfy all the **conditions A to F** and if the service is operated to a timetable.

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task.
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested.
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.
  * analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with government services so we can make them better.

You can manage these small files and learn more about them from [Directgov: How government websites use cookies](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/SiteInformation/Cookies/DG_WP201851?CID=Central&PLA=url_mon&CRE=managing_cookies)..

To promote healthier journeys to work and to reduce environmental pollution, the 1999 Finance Act introduced an annual tax exemption, which allows employers to loan cycles and cyclists' safety equipment to employees as a tax-free benefit. The exemption was one of a series of measures introduced under the government's Green Transport Plan. The following guidelines clarify how organisations can take advantage of the exemption to implement a Cycle to Work scheme that encourages employees to cycle to work and allows employers to reap the benefits of a healthier workforce.

These notes are for guidance only and reflect the tax position at the time of writing and the law as it relates to the provision of consumer credit. The tax exemption refers to cycles and cyclists' safety equipment loaned to employees by employers. However, where salary sacrifice arrangements are used, Cycle to Work schemes must be regulated hire agreements between the employer and the employee. The terms 'hire' and 'loan' are therefore both used in these guidelines.

The following guidelines clarify how organisations can take advantage of the exemption to implement a Cycle to Work scheme that encourages employees to cycle to work and allows employers to reap the benefits of a healthier workforce.

A consortium led by AECOM working with the University of the West of England and The Tavistock Institute is undertaking an independent evaluation of the Cycling City and Towns (CCT) programme. They are working with Sustrans (who are leading a programme of monitoring activity) to measure the extent to which the anticipated outcomes and wider impacts have been generated by the CCT programme and to measure its efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.

## Reports

An interim report has been published which provides a summary of the initial emerging evidence from the evaluation of the CCT programme.

## Background to the Cycling City and Towns Programme

Between April 2008 and March 2011, the Department for Transport, the Department of Health and Cycling England invested over £140m to promote cycling and to address a historic decline in cycling activity. Part of this investment (around £50m) was used to create one Cycling City and eleven Cycling Towns (CCTs). Alongside matched funding from the participating local authorities, the investment aimed to deliver a step change in the provision of facilities and the promotion of cycling for travel and leisure purposes, leading to wider impacts in areas such as health, decongestion, reduced carbon emissions and accessibility.

The programme built on the experience of the six original Cycling Demonstration Towns (CDTs), which began receiving increased levels of funding in 2005, and which reported interim evaluation results in 2009.

## Evaluation Approach 

The aims of the evaluation are to:

  * measure the extent to which the anticipated outcomes and wider impacts have been achieved through the CCT programme and to assess whether it has provided value for money
  * assess the effectiveness of interventions, including those targeted towards specific population groups and journeys
  * understand the factors which drive local travel behaviours and how these can be influenced to encourage cycling behaviours
  * explore the approaches which have been critical to the success of the programme
  * generate evidence of good practice which can be used to inform the design and delivery of future local initiatives aimed at encouraging cycling

The evaluation approach has been informed by the evaluation framework developed to assess the impacts of small-scale, low-cost transport schemes which make 'Better Use' of the existing network.

  * [Evaluating transport schemes which make better use of the existing network](/publications/evaluating-transport-schemes-making-better-use-existing-network/)

The evaluation uses a ""Theory of Change"" approach which assesses the implementation of the programme from its rationale to its inputs and outputs, to test whether the programme has caused the intended and unintended outcomes and wider impacts.

  * [Guidance for transport impact evaluations (section 6.2)](/publications/guidance-for-transport-impact-evaluations/), 17 March 2010 

This approach has guided the development of data collection activities, which include:

  * large-scale pre-and post-intervention surveys of households in CCT programme areas,
  * qualitative interviews and accompanied cycle journeys with residents in each CCT, 
  * interviews with local delivery teams and local and national stakeholders, and
  * monitoring trends in cycling activity.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/cycling-city-and-towns-programme-interim-report,Evaluation of the Cycling City and Towns Programme interim report,Interim findings from the evaluation of the Cycling City and Towns Programme.,"The report presents interim findings from the evaluation of the Cycling City and Towns Programme, including the results of a baseline survey and qualitative interviews with programme managers and national stakeholders.

The findings in the report focus on the approaches taken by the Cycling City and Towns to deliver the investment, in particular how they approached increasing cycling for key population groups and destinations, drawing out transferable learning about designing and delivering a cycling scheme from the local cycling teams' experiences. The report also presents emerging findings from the baseline survey undertaken in 2009 to provide an understanding of the cycling and wider transport behaviours of residents in the CCT areas, and insight into the motivators and barriers to increasing cycling.

Whilst it is too early to assess the impacts of the programme, the report will be of interest to local and national organisations designing and delivering schemes to encourage cycling, as well as to researchers working in the areas of sustainable transport, active travel and behaviour change.

## Introduction

This document provides guidance on what to consider before you make a Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOI Act) or Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) request to central DfT or a DfT executive agency.

  * [Freedom of Information Act 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/contents)
  * [The Environmental Information Regulations 2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/3391/contents/made)

## Personal information

If you want to see a copy of any personal information we might hold on you, our information charter explains how to make a request under the Data Protection Act 1998.

  * [Information charter](/publications/information-charter)
  * [Data Protection Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents)

## Is the information already available?

The Department is not required to provide information that is already reasonably accessible to you from elsewhere. That applies whether the information is on our own website or somewhere else in the public domain.

The Department places great importance on transparency and proactively publishes as much information as possible on its website. In particular, a wide range of information and data is available at:

  * [Consultations](/consultations)
  * [News](/news)
  * [Publications](/publications)
  * [Statistics](/statistics)
  * [Transparency](/transparency/)

To help you find information, our website is also categorised into the four main transport modes:

  * [Aviation](/aviation)
  * [Rail](/rail)
  * [Roads](/roads)
  * [Shipping](/shipping)

There are direct links to the websites of transport agencies and non-departmental public bodies:

  * [Transport bodies](/transport-bodies/)

Publication schemes specify the categories of information that the Department and it agencies publish or intend to publish, how to obtain that information, and whether any payment is required.

  * [DfT publication scheme](/publications/dft-publication-scheme/)
  * [DSA publication scheme](/publications/dsa-publication-scheme/)

## Be clear about what you want

If the information you are interested in has not already been published on our website, please make an FOI or EIR request to us. It will help us deal with your request speedily if you:

  * clearly explain what you want to find out about
  * be as specific as you can; if you want a particular piece of information please say so in your request
  * say whether the information you want relates to a specific timescale
  * do not ask for information that is already on our website

If you need background material, please bear in mind that our record keeping is extensive and information about the subject you have requested may be contained within a large number of documents. Requests asking DfT for 'everything you have' about a subject will mean that we have to contact you to clarify your request, and may even result in us refusing the request on cost grounds.

Please also remember that we are only required under FOI to provide recorded information.

If you have a query about information we have published, it will often be quicker for you to contact the relevant part of our Department by phone.

  * [Contact us](/about/contact/)

## Valid ways to make your request

You do not need to quote any legislation in your request -- it is for us to know which law applies and to answer your request accordingly.

Requests under the FOI Act must be made in writing, eg letter, email or fax. Requests under the EIR can also be made verbally, eg over the phone. You should include the following with both types of request:

  * your name and address (physical or electronic) for correspondence
  * a clear statement of the information you are requesting
  * a contact telephone number in case we need to discuss your request
  * the format in which you wish to receive the information

### Format in which the information may be disclosed - electronic, hard copy, or a visit to see it

Most of the information the Department holds is stored electronically and will be disclosed to you in PDF (portable document format). If you need information to be supplied in a different format, and it is reasonable to release the information in that way, the Department will do its best to meet your request.

Some material, in particular material that is over ten years old, may only be available on paper, or as photos maps or plans. While it will usually be possible to provide scanned copies of such information, there may be circumstances (for example in the case of plans that are larger than A3 size) where it may not be possible to disclose information to you in an electronic format.

In a limited number of circumstances, due to the volume, size or format of our recorded material, the only practical way the Department can make it available to you is by allowing you to come and view it in person. The Department and its agencies have facilities for such visits, and where necessary we will be pleased to agree a mutually convenient time with you.

## What you can request

You may request any information held by or on behalf of the Department and recorded in any form. This includes paper records (including hand written notes), information held on computers, other electronically held information (audio and video recordings), plans, maps, and photographs.

You are entitled to the information contained in documents, not to the documents themselves. However, where appropriate and convenient we may choose to provide a copy of the document rather than extracting the information from it.

Please note that the FOI Act and the EIR do not require public authorities to create new information or give an opinion or judgment that is not already recorded.

### Environmental information

If your request is wholly or partly for ""environmental information"" the Department is required to treat that part of your request as a request under the EIR.

  1. the state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere, water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including genetically modified organisms, and the interaction among these elements
  2. factors, such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste, including radioactive waste, emissions, discharges and other releases into the environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment referred to in (a)
  3. measures (including administrative measures), such as policies, legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to in (a) and (b) as well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements
  4. reports on the implementation of environmental legislation
  5. cost-benefit and other economic analyses and assumptions used within the framework of the measures and activities referred to in (c)
  6. the state of human health and safety, including the contamination of the food chain, where relevant, conditions of human life, cultural sites and built structures inasmuch as they are or may be affected by the state of the elements of the environment referred to in (a) or, through those elements, by any of the matters referred to in (b) and (c)

## Are you asking for too much?

If you are asking for a lot of material, it may be more than we can manage without it significantly impacting on our other work.

Our policy, along with all other government departments, is to release as much information as possible without charging a fee. But if it will cost the department more than £600 to deal with an FOI request, or if we consider under the EIRs that it would be ""manifestly unreasonable"" to do so, we do not have to respond to it.

Factors we are allowed to take into account in deciding whether a request exceeds the cost limit are: 

  * checking whether the information is held
  * locating the information or documents containing the information
  * retrieving such information or documents
  * extracting information from documents

The rule of thumb is that if it takes more than three and a half days of staff time to deal with your request, it will exceed the £600 FOI cost limit and we may refuse to answer it. If your request is refused on cost grounds, we will advise you how best to make a fresh narrower request that can be met within the cost limit.

For requests that are less than the £600 ceiling, we may charge the full costs of disbursements (photocopying, printing and postage). If we intend to do this we will inform you, and we do not have to provide the information if you fail to pay within three months.

For independent advice on how best to make a request see:

  * [Information Commissioner's Office: How can I access official information](http://www.ico.gov.uk/youth/sitecore/content/Home/for_the_public/official_information/how_access.aspx)

## Where to send your request

The central Department and agencies each have separate record keeping systems and processes for handling FOI and EIR requests. To ensure that you get the quickest response, it is important that you send your request to the right part of the Department.

The online request form gives you the option to select where you want your request to go to, or you can email your request direct.

  * [Online FOI request form](https://www.dft.gov.uk/foi/form/)
  * How to make a request direct to any part of the DfT family

If you want information that is about supporting ministers, new legislation, or the development of transport policy for aviation, rail, roads, or shipping transport, then your request should be made to the central Department.

  * [Contact us](/about/contact/)

Requests for information held by the central Department will be dealt with by the staff who are responsible for the subject matter on a day to day basis. If your request covers more than one subject it will be split and handled by different groups of staff, but the response will be a single co-ordinated one.

If the information you need is **not** about supporting ministers, new legislation, or the development of transport policy, it is more likely to be the responsibility of one of DfT's seven agencies.

  * [Transport bodies](/transport-bodies/)

DfT's agencies deal with members of the public, businesses, and other organisations for vehicle licences, road tax, driving tests, heavy goods vehicle and passenger vehicle licensing, coastguard operations, highway matters and in many other ways. Information about many of these 'transactions' is available via Directgov and Business Link.

  * [Motoring](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/index.htm)
  * [Travel and transport](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/index.htm)
  * [Transport and logistics](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1081597476&r.s=tl&topicId=1082103262)

You may want information from more than one part of the Department, for example from more than one of our agencies, or from all of the agencies and the central Department. If so, we will usually co-ordinate the handling of your request and provide you with a single response. There may be times, however, when it would be quicker for you and more efficient for us for each agency to deal with your request separately. Please bear in mind that the wider ranging you make your request, the more likely it is that the cost limit will apply.

If you send the same request to more than one part of DfT, or to another government department, please tell us. This will help us ensure that your request is properly co-ordinated.

There are other public bodies, independent of DfT, who will also hold transport-related information.

  * [Non departmental public bodies](/transport-bodies/ndpb/)
  * [Other transport bodies](/transport-bodies/other/)
  * [Transport for London](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/)

Most information that is over ten years old is kept by The National Archive. It is worth trying them first for older material.

  * [The National Archive](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/)
  * [UK government web archive](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/webarchive/)

Remember: if your request is not sent to the correct authority it may be delayed while it is transferred to the right place.

## What DfT will do when we receive your request

We will acknowledge your request as soon as we can.

We will let you know if your request should be dealt with under the EIR or the Data Protection Act 1998 instead of, or as well as, the FOI Act. Where you are asking for information that we routinely give out (such as leaflets, contact details etc), we may, in the interests of efficiency, just send you the information and not treat your request as a formal FOI or EIR request.

The law obliges us to answer your request promptly and at most (subject to limited exceptions) within 20 working days from receiving it. If, in the limited circumstances where we are permitted to do so, we need to extend the timescale to give proper consideration to your request, we will let you know.

If it is not clear to us what information you want, we will need to contact you. We will do this by telephone, email or letter depending on the contact details that you supplied when you sent us your request. Our aim is to be helpful and to fulfil your request as completely as we can. The 20 working day deadline will only start when it is clear to us what you require.

If your request relates to a person/company other than yourself or where disclosure of the information you are requesting could affect the interests of another person, we may need to consult that third party before responding to your request. We will follow the guidance in section four (""Consultation with third parties"") of the FOI code of practice where it applies.

  * [Freedom of information code of practice](http://www.justice.gov.uk/information-access-rights/foi-guidance-for-practitioners/code-of-practice)

If DfT does not hold the information requested, we will let you know and if we think it may be held by another public authority will normally suggest that you redirect your request to them.

### Your rights under the FOI Act

On receipt of a valid request for information the DfT must:

  * inform you in writing whether it holds the information requested (known as the 'duty to confirm or deny') and if so
  * communicate that information to you

DfT is not required to comply with these obligations where one or more exemptions apply.

  * [Freedom of Information Act 2000: Part 2 exempt information](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/part/II)

Any individual or company may make a request, and you do not need to be a UK citizen or living in the UK to do so.

The DfT does not need to know why you are making the request or what you intend to do with the information. We will not impose conditions on the use or further disclosure of the information we disclose to you, although you should be aware that the information may be subject to copyright protection.

The FOI Act is enforced by the [Information Commissioner](http://www.ico.gov.uk/).

## When our FOI Act obligations do not apply

The FOI Act contains a number of exemptions from these obligations, most of which involve the application of a public interest test.

  * [Freedom of Information Act 2000: Part 2 exempt information](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/part/II)
  * [Exemption guidance for freedom of information (FOI)](http://www.justice.gov.uk/information-access-rights/foi-guidance-for-practitioners/exemptions-guidance)

If your request is refused, our reply will identify which exemption (or exemptions) we are relying on.

  * **Geographical coverage: England**
  * **Information broken down by: National level aggrevation**

## Latest data

  * Provisional data shows that 83.0 per cent of journeys made on Highways Agency managed roads between August 2011 and June 2012 were 'on time'. This is 0.2 percentage points lower than the previous rolling year, ending in May 2012.
  * During July 2012, provisional data shows that 81.8 per cent of journeys on Highways Agency's motorway and 'A' road network were 'on time'. This is 2.5 percentage points lower than the equivalent figure for July 2011.
  * The annual reliability measure consistently increased up to March 2012, but has fallen in the last four months, and is now similar to the level observed at the end of 2011. National trends in reliability are heavily influenced by the weather and the recent downward trend reflects the substantial amount of rainfall experienced in recent months, compared with the same period in 2011. Recent decreases in reliability are also explained in part by updated journey reference times in April 2012.

### Notes

  * Journeys are defined as travel between adjacent junctions on the network. 
  * An 'on time' journey is defined as one which is completed within a set reference time, drawn from historic data on that section of road.
  * Reference journey times are updated for the April data each year. Further information on the impact of updating reference times can be found in section 3 of the latest Statistical Release.

## Background information

This indicator monitors the reliability of journeys made on Highways Agency's motorway and A road network.

The indicator is measured by the percentage of 'journeys' on these roads that are 'on time'. For this measure:

  * A 'journey' represents travel between adjacent junctions on the network.
  * An 'on time journey' is defined as one which is completed within a set reference time, drawn from historic data on that particular section of road.

At present, information about the reliability of journeys on individual routes, or between particular junctions on the network, are not sufficiently robust to be presented as official statistics. This is due to the range of different sources used to calculate journey times across the network.

The Department are working with the Highways Agency to address these issues of comparability. It is likely that any actions to address these issues will also require some historic adjustment to the national series although the trends reported in national reliability to date are unlikely to change.

Until this programme is complete, the Highways Agency will publish information about journey time reliability at a sub-national level through the data.gov.uk webpage.

## Background information

The Public Performance Measure (PPM) combines figures for punctuality and reliability into a single performance record. It covers all scheduled franchised passenger services, seven days a week and measures the arrival punctuality of individual trains against their planned timetable. These plans, technically called plan of the day, are usually the same as the published timetable with amendments reflecting pre-published engineering amendments; however, they may differ from their originally published timetable. The reliability figure records the percentage of services that are cancelled.

PPM is therefore the percentage of trains which are punctual compared to the total number of trains planned. A train is defined as punctual if it arrives at its destination within five minutes of the scheduled destination arrival time for London and South East and regional operators; or within ten minutes for long-distance operators.

PPM data can be expressed as either for the time period, or as a Moving Annual Average (MAA) which is an average for the most recent 13 four-week reporting periods. MAA figures smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight the annual background.

ORR publishes Network Rail's PPM data on their data portal. Network Rail releases these PPM data by franchise, by four-week period, every four weeks, once the figures have been confirmed. These data are subject to correction, although the corrections are usually minor. Corrections arise because the plan of the day can change up to 10pm the night before, and there may be a manual process to match train performance with the plan of the day, and this can take some time to complete. Corrections occur most often after periods of significant perturbation.

## Background information

This indicator tracks UK domestic greenhouse gas emissions from transport, plus 'memo items' which include emissions from international aviation and international shipping. These emissions are 'by source' which means that indirect emissions such as those resulting from the processing of transport fuels, are not included in this indicator. However figures which do include such indirect emissions are available and are known as 'by final user' figures.

Reported UK domestic greenhouse gas emissions figures are based on an internationally agreed basket of six greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, PFC and SF6). Each of these gases is measured in terms of the equivalent weight of carbon dioxide that would need to be emitted into the atmosphere to produce the same estimated radiative forcing (the extent to which a given concentration of a greenhouse gas raises global average temperature). The UK transport greenhouse gas emission estimates are designed to be consistent with UK fuel sales data (published by DECC) in line with international guidelines.

Over the same period motor vehicle traffic remained broadly stable. Compared with the 2005-9 average, the number killed in 2011 was 32 per cent lower.
  * 2011 saw the first annual increase in fatalities since 2003, but this year's figure remains below the 2009 figure of 2,222. Adverse weather (heavy snow falls) experienced in the first and last quarters of 2010 but not in 2011 are likely to be a factor in the increase in fatalities recorded in 2011.

## Background information

This indicator is based on deaths in road traffic accidents on the public highway reported to the police where the casualty sustained injuries which caused death less than 30 days after the accident.

The indicator can be broken down by any geographical area (eg country, region, local authority) since a grid reference is collected for each accident. Information is also available by age, gender, type of road user and road type. Numbers will be relatively small for more detailed breakdowns of the total and may therefore fluctuate from year to year. This needs to be taken into account when assessing trends.

Detailed breakdowns of the data are published in Reported Road Casualties Great Britain Annual Report and Road Casualties Online (which includes an accident level dataset), these publications and further information can be found through the [Road accidents and safety series](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/series/road-accidents-and-safety/) page.

  * **Latest headline data:** 97 (2011)
  * **Publishing schedule:** annually, June each year
  * **Information broken down by:** Geographically by local authority, urban and rural areas, and regions.

## Latest data

  * The index accessibility score for England in 2011 was 97.
  * The 2011 score is slightly down from 100 in 2010. This suggests that there has been a decrease in accessibility to key services. The decrease in accessibility could be as a result of a decrease in the frequency of public transport services or the number of routes; closures or relocation of key service locations; or improvements to service destinations dataset. Although the number of bus service trips in England has decreased between 2010 and 2011 (see table [BUS1001](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/bus1001/)), it is likely that the latter two factors will have had the greatest affect on accessibility.

## Background information

This indicator incorporates information on car availability alongside walking, cycling, and public transport options to give an overall measure of how the Department's policies encourage economic growth and reduce social exclusion.

Information on the robustness and the data limitations for each year's data is available in section 3 of the guidance notes (see the further information section for a link). Only registered public transport services are included in the Accessibility calculations. This means Demand Responsive Transport, other flexibly routed services, and school transport services are usually not included. Therefore, especially in rural areas, Accessibility Indicators are likely to be an underestimate of actual accessibility.

  * **Information broken down by:** local authority (on request from the Vehicle Licensing Statistics team on [vehicles.stats@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailo:vehicles.stats@dft.gsi.gov.uk))

## Latest data

  * There were 2,114 new ultra low emission vehicles licensed for the first time in the United Kingdom during 2011. These include 1,209 cars and quadricycles, 446 motorcycles, 11 buses and coaches, and 448 commercial or specialist vehicles.
  * Most of the vehicles have low emissions as they use electric engines, hence they have no tailpipe emissions. A very small number have combustion engines and emit below 75 grams of CO2 per kilometre driven. These vehicles typically have a plug-in hybrid electric engine and up to 2011 only a very low number car models with such engines were available on the market in the United Kingdom.

## Background information

The Department for Transport uses the term 'ultra-low emission vehicles' to refer to vehicles with significantly lower levels of tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles. In practice, the term currently refers to electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.  Vehicles that use non-fossil fuel propulsion have zero tailpipe emissions. For other propulsion types, only vehicles with tailpipe emissions below 75 grams per kilometre are included.

The figures are produced from DVLA's and DVA's new registration system and only vehicles being registered in Great Britain or Northern Ireland for the first time are included.

## Notes

1. The First Transpennine Express subsidy totals were adjusted (on 10/10/11) following a revision to the total passenger kilometres figures published in ORR's National Rail Trends   
2. Network Grant totals for 2010/11 by TOC were adjusted (on 31/10/11) to reflect a £100m rebate received from Network Rail in the year

## Indicator data

[Subsidy data published in National Rail Trends](http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/nrt_ch6_miscellaneous_tables.pdf)

Network Grant estimates derived from DfT internal management information used in the underlying calculation to apportion the network grant by TOC, the fixed track charges schedule is available on ORR's website at [www.rail-reg.gov.uk](http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/cp4-pl-fixed_track_charges_sched_181208.pdf)

## **Background information**

Published subsidy figures are based on assumed revenue levels, either set out in the franchise agreement or based on actuals provided by the PTEs. However, this may overstate the actual subsidy paid where it has been based on the franchise agreement. Actual subsidy per mile figures may therefore be less than stated for these operators.

There is no recognised rule for allocating the network grant across franchises. The distribution of Fixed Track Access Charges has been used to allocate the Network Grant by train operator.

## Latest data

  * In 2010/11 the average level of subsidy (direct from central government) per passenger journey was 9.1 pence. This decreased (adjusted for inflation) from 10.1 pence in 2004/05. 
  * English non-Metropolitan areas had the highest level of subsidy per passenger journey (14.5 pence in 2010/11), London had the lowest level of subsidy per passenger journey (4.8 pence in 2010/11) while English Metropolitan areas were in-between (12.0 pence in 2010/11). Comparisons between London and the rest of the country should be made with care - see note below.

## Background information 

Lower subsidy per passenger journey will indicate better value for the public purse. However, this could arise as a result of reductions in the most heavily subsidised services - many of which are routes in rural areas which would be unprofitable without public subsidy. Reductions to these services would improve the 'headline' measure but would risk making rural communities more isolated. 

The figures exclude expenditure on capital projects (eg bus lane priority schemes) which benefit the bus industry directly or indirectly. Outside London, the local bus industry is deregulated, but London runs an entirely tendered bus market under the oversight of Transport for London. Given the different market structures, comparisons between London and the rest of country should be made with considerable care.

## Background information

The indicator reports the VfM ratings presented to ministers when spending decisions are made, using the Department's VfM process. It also uses the estimate of cost to the Department of those decisions.

The Department's VfM process was introduced in 2004 to consistently present to Ministers a summary of the benefits and costs of transport proposals. The VfM assessment measures the expected benefits to each pound of spending covered by the appraisal process. The VfM process covers all major schemes that are subject to ministerial approval.

This indicator covers approved spending of schemes that ministers have given final approval to within the period indicated.

## Notes

### Operating costs

(a) These data are based on each operator's statutory accounts. Any figures relating to premia or associated payments to the Department for Transport or Passenger Transport Executives are excluded.

(b) For each operator, the latest available statutory accounts have been used. As indicated above, the periods covered by each set of accounts do not always match. Because of this, it is not appropriate to sum up each item to derive a total cost.

(c) Although we have aimed to be as consistent as possible, operators may not treat all aspects of operating costs in the same way in their accounts, and so care should be taken when using these figures.

### Network Grant

(d) This is calculated by taking the total network grant in 2010-11, and allocating it to each franchise based on their share of Fixed Track Access Charges.

## Background information

The ""Operating cost"" column shows the costs incurred by each Train Operating Company (TOC) associated with running their services; this is based on operators' statutory accounts, and excludes any premia or subsidy. Within this total are payments made by operators to Network Rail for access to the rail network which contribute towards infrastructure costs.

The ""Allocated network grant"" column, allocates, to each operator, the grant paid by the Department for Transport to Network Rail in 2010-11. The grant effectively pays the infrastructure costs incurred by Network Rail that are not covered by operators. In the table above, each operator is allocated a share of the grant in proportion to their Fixed Track Access Charge.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-complaints-procedure,Complaints procedure for the central Department for Transport only,How the public may make a complaint if they are dissatisfied with the Department's service delivery or administrative practices.,"## Making a complaint

The Department aims to provide a high quality of service to the public. Please let us know if you feel we have not achieved that aim and we will do our best to put things right. Feedback - both good and bad - helps us continue to improve our service.

If your complaint is about the service you have received from the central part of the Department (not one of the executive agencies), the guidance below explains who you should complain to and how we will deal with your complaint.

If your complaint is about our policies or transport-related legislation, you should contact the relevant policy division.

  * [Contact us](/about/contact/)

Alternatively, you can ask your MP to take up your complaint with the Secretary of State for Transport.

If the service is provided by one of our executive agencies, you will need to get in touch with that agency direct. Each of the Agencies has its own complaints procedure and the central Department is not able to deal with, or comment on, complaints about the service provided by any of the DfT agencies.

  * [Making a complaint to the executive agencies](/about/contact/complaints/#agencies)

## Complaints about our service in the central Department for Transport

### Step 1

If you have a complaint about our service, the best way to resolve it will usually be through the officer you have been dealing with. You can do this over the phone, by email, in writing, or you may be able to make an appointment to see them in person.

### Step 2

If you feel that this is not the right way to resolve your complaint, or you have already tried and are not satisfied with the outcome, you should make a formal complaint by contacting the Head of the Division you have been dealing with.

The contact details for our staff are available through our [Enquiry Service](/about/contact/#dft).

The division should acknowledge your complaint within five working days and provide a full response within 20 working days.

Please contact the Enquiry Service on 0300 330 3000 if you need any help in making a complaint.

### Step 3

If you remain dissatisfied, you can contact our independent Complaints Officer. The Complaints Officer is independent of the policy and operational divisions in the Department and will look at your complaint with a fresh pair of eyes.

Please note that the Complaints Officer cannot consider a complaint until it has first been reviewed by the relevant division. Sending your complaint direct to the Complaints Officer will delay the handling of your complaint.

The Complaints Officer is also unlikely to be able to consider our actions during the course of court proceedings which have their own procedures for appeal.

The address to write to is:

Complaints Officer  
Department for Transport  
D/01, Ashdown House  
Sedlescombe Road North  
St Leonards on Sea  
East Sussex  
TN37 7GA

Email: [dftcomplaints@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:dftcomplaints@dft.gsi.gov.uk)  
Telephone: 0300 330 3000

The Complaints Officer will acknowledge your complaint within five working days. As part of the investigation your complaint will be discussed with the Division you dealt with originally. Recommendations will then be made to the division on how best to resolve your complaint and, if appropriate, measures to prevent the same thing happening again. 

Following this you will receive our final response, which should be within a further 15 working days. If we need longer, we will let you know why and when to expect our final reply.

## What to do if you remain dissatisfied

If you are not satisfied with the Complaints Officer's response you can write to your MP, who can refer your complaint to the [Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman](http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/contact_us/index.html).

## Freedom of Information Act 2000, Environmental Information Regulations 2004, Data Protection Act

### Step 1

Should you be unhappy with the outcome of an FOI Act, Environmental Information Regulation request, you should, in the first instance, contact the named individual within DfT who signed your response. He/she will review your complaint, reconsider any decisions relating to the release or withholding of information and, if appropriate, provide a further response.

### Step 2

If, after review, the original response is considered correct, your complaint will be reconsidered by another DfT official (of at least the same level of seniority) who has had no previous involvement with your request or complaint.

### Step 3

If you are dissatisfied with the results of DfT's internal review, you may appeal to the [Information Commissioner](http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/).

If you have a query about the outcome of a Data Protect Act query please contact the [Data Protection Officer](/publications/foi-request/).",guidance,,,Transparency,department-for-transport,,,,17-Sep-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Equality Act 2010 contains a new integrated public sector Equality Duty, which came into force on 5 April 2011. It requires public bodies to have due regard to eliminating unlawful discrimination, advancing equality of opportunity and fostering good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not, with the aim of making society fairer.

The information published here is used by the Department to inform our decision making, in compliance with the general Equality Duty. It includes research undertaken by the Department and external bodies.

The final impact assessment for reforms to the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) scheme.

## What is the problem under consideration? Why is government intervention necessary?

The ATOL scheme protects consumers when their package holiday tour operator becomes insolvent. It needs updating to reflect how holidays are now sold. Developments in the travel industry have made it increasingly difficult for consumers to know whether or not their holiday is a 'package' as legally defined and so protected under the ATOL scheme. Intervention is needed to restore clarity for consumers and the travel trade. Also, for historic reasons the scheme's finances are in deficit of £42m. Intervention is needed to put the scheme back on a sustainable basis, allowing the government guarantee underpinning ATOL to be withdrawn and so that holidaymakers and travel firms fund the scheme rather than taxpayers.

This Impact Assessment is concerned with further reforms to the Air Travel Organiser's Licensing (ATOL) scheme, additional to those set out in the other recent IA on this subject ([IA no. DfT 00092](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-ia-00092/)). The reforms in that IA can be implemented through secondary legislation, namely new ATOL reform regulations. The reforms outlined in this IA would require new primary legislation to broaden the scope of the Secretary of State's powers to make regulations about the ATOL scheme. Such powers are included in the Civil Aviation Bill, introduced to Parliament in January 2012. Subject to the parliamentary process, when the Bill becomes law, new regulations would need to be made to actually give effect to the reforms if the government took the decision to proceed with this approach.

Our aim is to achieve value for money, by seeking the optimum combination of quality and whole life cost to meet our needs.

The Department buys services, goods and works by competition whenever possible, in line with UK government policy and the relevant legal requirements.

The Department aims to specify its requirements in outputs (ie deliverables rather than methodology), and welcomes innovative proposals from tenderers.

For low value procurements we invite written quotations from a number of suppliers. For larger procurements, we invite formal tenders.  Single Tender Action is rarely considered.

The following table shows the number of tenders we invite in the central Department (DfTc) - please note that DfT Agency rules may vary:

**Estimated contract value**
**Tender action required**

Up to £2,000
Normally a single oral quote

£2,001 to £5,000
Normally a minimum of three oral quotes

£5,001 to £25,000

In line with government procurement policy, DfT has adopted Centralised Category Procurement (CCP).  It collaborates with other government departments as widely as possible and makes use of centrally awarded Framework Agreements for common goods and services.

A Framework Agreement is an agreement to provide specified goods and services - no commitment is made and no contract exists until an order is placed.  DfT uses central framework agreements for all the goods and services covered by the CCP initiative.

## EU public procurement law

The European Union (EU) Procurement Directives, and the Regulations that implement them in the UK, set out the law on public procurement. Their purpose is to open up the public procurement market and to ensure the free movement of goods and services within the EU.

The Regulations apply to purchases by public bodies and certain utilities, the value of which exceed specific monetary thresholds. They cover all EU Member States and, because of international agreements, some rules may extend to other countries worldwide.

Where the Regulations apply, contracts must be advertised in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) and there are other detailed rules that must be followed. The Regulations are enforced through the courts of Member States, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ).

The current minimum value of contracts that must be advertised are:

**Supplies**
**Services**
**Works**

£113,057

£113,057

£4,348,350

However contracts below these values may be advertised where it is felt to be advantageous to do so.

## Procurement ethics

Public servants follow a strict code of procurement ethics. They and members of their families may not accept gifts or offers of hospitality from individuals or organisations with whom DfT has, or could possibly have at some time in the future, a contractual relationship. Any personal or financial interest in suppliers bidding for work must also be declared.",policy-papers,,,,department-for-transport,procurement-at-the-department-for-transport,,,21-Feb-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-procurement-strategy,Department for Transport procurement strategy,Information on the Department's commercial and procurement strategy and how it will be implemented across the Department and its Agencies.,"## Centralised category procurement

Centralised category procurement (CCP) is a key part of the government's centralising procurement agenda.  It provides an established process for developing a procurement strategy for each CCP category, and a governance structure that will deliver a mandated outcome for each category.  CCP has Ministerial backing and is government Policy, and the Minister of State for Transport has responsibility for ensuring CCP is implemented across the DfT Family (DfT Centre and agencies).

The CCP approach has been adopted by the Department, with Category Leads appointed across the Department's procurement specialists to represent the whole Department's needs.  This approach enables Category Leads to develop an in-depth knowledge of their particular areas of spend.

The government's CCP agenda means that DfT will no longer be responsible for letting contracts in certain categories of common goods and services, but the expertise built up by the category leads will provide DfT with a strong intelligent customer resource to feed into wider government initiatives.

DfT has in place a lead official for each CCP category together with a supporting structure that provides DfT family-wide engagement through the operation of representative user groups for each CCP category.

The following procurement categories are covered by the CCP initiative:

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-publication-scheme,Department for Transport publication scheme,The Publication Scheme specifies the categories of information that the Department and its agencies publish and explains how to obtain that information.,"# DfT publication scheme

The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOI Act) requires public authorities to adopt and maintain a publication scheme, the purpose of which is to: 

  * specify the classes of information we have committed to publish
  * say how we will make that information available
  * say whether the information is available free of charge or on payment

Most of the information covered by our publication scheme will be made available on this website. If you need information in an alternative format, we will do all we reasonably can to help.

Our publication scheme follows the Information Commissioner's model publication scheme for public authorities. It covers the following executive agencies:

  * Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
  * Driving Standards Agency
  * Government Car and Despatch Agency
  * Highways Agency
  * Maritime and Coastguard Agency
  * Vehicle and Operator Services Agency
  * Vehicle Certification Agency

## About this publication scheme

This publication scheme is not a list of individual publications but rather a description of the classes or types of information that we are committed to publishing.

The scheme is not an exhaustive list of all the types of information that we publish -- our policy is to publish proactively as much information as we can where the information would have a wider public interest.

The scheme does not include information that we consider to be sensitive, such as certain types of commercial or personal information, or information about security matters or which comprises legal advice.

Most DfT publications, including priced publications, are available online. Where publications are not available online, details of how to obtain hardcopies are provided.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/drug-driving-faqs,Drug driving offence and drug screening devices FAQ,Frequently asked questions concerning the new drug driving offence and drug screening devices.,"## Q. Why introduce a new drug driving offence?

  * The Bill includes a new offence of driving, or being in a charge of, a motor vehicle with concentrations of specified controlled drugs in excess of specified levels. This is similar to, but not the same as, current drink driving legislation (that is, section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1988). 
  * The new offence will increase the effectiveness of enforcement activity, with the intention of bringing more drivers under the influence of drugs to justice, deterring driving whilst impaired through drugs and improving road safety.

## Q. What is the evidence that drug driving is such a big problem?

  * The Review of Drink and Drug Driving Law by Sir Peter North (June 2010) concluded that there was ""a significant drug driving problem, which is out of all proportion to the 56 fatal and 207 serious accidents reported by police in 2008 as involving impairment by drugs"".

## Q. What penalty will the new offence attract?

  * The penalties available for the new drug driving offence will be similar to those for the existing offence of driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle with an alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit for drink driving. This will involve up to 6 months imprisonment and / or a fine of up to £5,000. For driving above the limit, there is also disqualification for at least 12 months.

## Q. But it is not a crime to have a drug in the body - are you changing this?

  * No. The new offence is purely related to driving (or being in charge of a vehicle) with drugs in the body. This is aimed at improving road safety. Under the current law it is already an offence to drive while unfit through drugs.
  * Secondary legislation (in the form of regulations) will set out the drugs covered by the offence and the specified limits for each. This will focus on drugs that reduce people's capacity to drive safely.

## Q. Does this new offence mean I will be committing a crime if I take medication and drive?

  * The new offence will not cover most standard medication. It will cover drugs which are controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and which impair driving or otherwise affect road safety. Often the supply and possession of such drugs is illegal already, but some have medical uses.
  * There will be a specific defence related to the controlled drugs covered by the new offence. This will cover controlled drugs taken in accordance with medical advice.
  * In general, if you take medication and need to drive, you need to check with your doctor or pharmacist and follow the advice enclosed with your medication about driving.
  * It already is, and remains, an offence to drive while impaired through drugs - and this applies to driving while impaired by any type of drug.

## Q. What will happen to those drivers who are on prescribed medication which might have traces of controlled drugs?

  * The new offence will provide a defence for those who are taking specified controlled drugs in accordance with medical advice.
  * The existing offence (under section 4 of the 1988 Act), which covers driving while impaired due to drugs, will continue to be relevant to deal with those whose driving is impaired by prescribed drugs (including specified controlled drugs taken in accordance with medical advice), 'legal highs' and controlled drugs not specified for the purposes of the new offence.
  * The police will have to prove impairment on a case by case basis for those who are charged with the existing offence (under section 4 of the 1988 Act).

## Q. What is the difference between the existing offence (in section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 1988) and the new drug driving offence?

  * Securing a conviction under the existing law in section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (driving unfit through drugs) requires the police to prove that: 
    * the offender was driving or in charge of a vehicle;
    * the offender was impaired so as to be unfit to drive and
    * the impairment was caused by presence of drugs.
    * The new specified limit offence will relieve the need for the police to prove impairment case-by-case where a specified drug has been detected above the specified limit.
    * The new offence will provide a more effective tool for dealing with the danger posed by driving under the influence of drugs, create a stronger deterrent against it, and ultimately contribute to reducing its incidence.

## Q. How do you propose the new offence to work with the existing offence?

  * The police will use the new offence to prosecute drivers whose evidential blood or urine samples contain more than the specified limits of those drugs provided for in regulations.
  * If the driver's evidential sample results do not detect drugs from the regulations, but there are other drugs present and there is evidence of impaired driving, the driver may be dealt with under the existing offence under Section 4 of the 1988 Act.

## Q. How will it be possible to decide a level for each drug that will impair driving? I have heard that not all drug users have same levels of tolerance?

  * We have called on a group of experts to work together to come up with recommendations for the types and levels of drugs to be covered by the new offence. The experts are likely to focus on the most common and prevalent controlled drugs for which there is evidence of causing impairment to driving and other road safety problems.
  * The list of drugs and levels will not be decided at this stage, but the new offence creates the power to set these in regulations. This will be done on the basis of recommendations by the expert panel and following public consultation.

## Q. What about roadside drug screening devices?

  * The drug detection devices will only be used as preliminary screening devices which will help the police to assess whether a driver's condition might be due to presence of drugs.
  * The government is committed to completing the testing and approval process for devices for use in police stations by the end of 2012. We anticipate that these devices will be ready to be used in 2013 - before the commencement of the new offence. They will help the effective enforcement of the law related to driving under the influence of drugs.
  * Roadside drug screening devices will help the police enforce the new offence. Plans are being developed to enable manufacturers to apply for type approval for them.

These statistics are produced by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which administers the driving test system in Great Britain.

Unlike most other Department for Transport (DfT) statistics, driving test statistics are compiled and published by staff in the DSA using data from the agency's operational systems. Statisticians in the central Department are not involved in their production and, as such, these statistics are not directly overseen by the DfT Head of Profession.

We are exploring options to regularise these arrangements for the future and would welcome the views of current or prospective users of driving test statistics. Please direct any comments to [vehicles.stats@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:vehicles.stats@dft.gsi.gov.uk)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-driving-test-centre-notice-boards-policy,DSA driving test centre notice boards policy,Read DSA's policy for posters that can be displayed in driving test centres and find out how to send a poster for approval.,"### General

1.1  The notice boards in driving test centres (DTCs) are managed by the DSA Posters team, based in Nottingham.

1.2  All DTCs have a notice board for the display of DSA posters. The majority of test centres also have a smaller, non-DSA notice board on which we display posters of interest to approved driver/rider trainers and our customers. These posters are non-commercial in nature.

1.3  We will consider posters for display from approved organisations and may also consider those from groups and driver/rider training associations that  have consultative body status with the agency.

1.4  This policy outlines the process you should follow to get a poster approved for display.

### 2. Aim

2.1  DSA test centre notice boards are used to promote road safety messages and communicate key DSA information to driver/rider trainers and customers.

2.2  We encourage ADIs to join approved associations - it helps improve our communication with them and allows their views to be properly represented in discussions with us. We will make every effort to display posters from these  driving/motorcycling associations once approved.

### 3. Availability of notice board space

3.1 Display of non-DSA posters is subject to space availability - such display is a concession and not a right.

3.2  In the event that we have too many requests for poster display compared to spaces available, we will decide which poster or leaflet gets precedence. Our decision is final and we are under no obligation to explain why we choose one request over another.

### 4. Specific exclusions

4.1  All information displayed on test centre notice boards should be appropriate and not offensive to any interest groups. We have the right to refuse to display any poster, without necessarily giving a reason. The decision of the DSA posters team is final. Posters will be refused if they promote any of the following:

  * alcohol 
  * drugs and tobacco 
  * speed camera detection equipment 
  * mobile phones and accessories 
  * loan agents 
  * religious material 
  * political parties 
  * instructor recruitment 
  * association recruitment (other than those with consultative status) 
  * anything we deem inappropriate for viewing by our teenage customers 
  * anything containing details of a website we deem inappropriate 
  * anything which is commercial in nature - including driving schools, driver improvement courses, car sales or garage services

4.2  This list is not exhaustive, and we reserve the right to refuse anything we deem inappropriate or which goes against any DSA, Department for Transport or other central government policies, campaigns or messages.

4.3  Posters containing commercial sponsor information and logos will be carefully considered. These may result in a poster becoming more commercial in nature than is deemed appropriate, leading to a refusal to display.

4.4  We reserve the right to remove any publicity materials at any time and without notice.

### 5. Guidelines for submitting a poster for consideration

5.1  An electronic version (pdf or jpeg) of your poster should be emailed to [dsaposters@dsa.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:dsaposters@dsa.gsi.gov.uk), along with details of the test centres in which you would like to display the poster.

5.2  The DSA posters team will consider your request and email approval or refusal within 10 working days of receipt. Requests received after normal working hours will be treated as being received the following working day.

5.3  If your poster is approved, the DSA posters team will email the relevant test centres alerting them to the fact that they will be receiving your poster in the next few days and specifying in which notice board position to display it, along with the removal date. The email will also contain a small image of the poster for confirmation purposes.

5.4  Once you have received an email approving the poster for display, you should despatch posters to the specified test centres. It is your responsibility to get the posters to the test centres, DSA will not send them out on your behalf.

5.5  Unapproved posters will not be displayed in test centres. Do not ask test centre staff to display posters that have not been submitted for approval. Any unapproved posters found on display will be removed and destroyed.

### 6. Approval and display of leaflets

6.1  We will consider leaflets for display in driving test centres, subject to the same exclusions detailed above for posters (4.1 - 4.2).

6.2  Draft leaflets should be submitted in the same way as posters (5.1).

6.3  If your leaflet is approved, the DSA posters team will let both you and the test centre know, by email, that the leaflet is suitable for display.

6.4  You will need to provide display cases for the leaflets, and take them to the DTC along with the leaflets. It will be your responsibility to replenish the leaflet stocks.

6.5  At the end of the permitted display period, any remaining leaflets and holders should be removed; any still in place two weeks after the expiry of the display period will be removed and destroyed.

### 7. Time limits on display of posters and leaflets

7.1  To ensure equal display opportunities for all, posters and leaflets may be displayed for a maximum of two calendar months at a time, in most cases.   Before the end of this time, a fresh application to display must be made. In certain circumstances, such as advertisements for national conferences of approved associations, an extension can be granted.

### 8. Administration

8.1  The DSA posters team will be responsible for approval of all posters and leaflets.

8.2  The DSA posters team will keep a record of which non-DSA posters are on display in which test centres and their removal dates.

8.3  Even if a poster or leaflet has been approved, it will only be displayed in test centres if space is available.

8.4  For leaflets, you should supply a suitable container and ensure that it is kept stocked with leaflets.",policy-papers,making-roads-safer,,,driving-standards-agency,,,,19-Aug-2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-operational-statistics,DSA operational statistics,These Driving Standards Agency (DSA) operational statistics show information which has not been designated as an official statistic.,"## Summary

These Driving Standards Agency (DSA) operational statistics show information which has not been designated as an [official statistic](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics?post_type=release&series=driving-tests-and-instructors). 

The statistics come from data held by the DSA which administers the driving test scheme in Great Britain. 

Unlike most other Department for Transport (DfT) statistics, these statistics are compiled and published by staff in DSA using data from the agency's operational systems. Statisticians in the central department are not involved in their production and, as such, these statistics are not directly overseen by the DfT head of profession.

## Data published

A timetable of operational practical statistics the DSA is publishing will be available by the end of August 2012. It will be published on this page. 

## Practical test statistics

The DSA started publishing practical test statistics in August 2010. All statistics give data from the 2007/08 financial year onwards.

  * [Operational practical driving test statistics](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-operational-practical-driving-test-statistics)

## Theory test statistics

The DSA has recently started reviewing data held about theory tests and is in the process of compiling and publishing this data. 

## Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) statistics

All statistics give data from the 2008/09 financial year.

  * [Driver CPC statistics](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-driver-cpc-statistics/)

## Information you cannot find

If you cannot find the information you need, it may have been:

  * published in response to an FOI request 
  * designated as an official statistic 

You can [send an FOI request](https://www.dft.gov.uk/foi/form/) if you still cannot find the information you need.

## Information that cannot be released

The DSA cannot send you information if it is part of an official statistic that has not yet been published. This is because the [Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/2998/contents/made) limits access to official statistics until they are published.",statistics,making-roads-safer,,Transparency,driving-standards-agency,dsa-statistics,,,16-Aug-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-privacy,Privacy policy for services provided by DSA,"Key services for which DSA processes personal data, with information about how and why that data is processed.","DSA, as an executive agency of the Department for Transport (DfT), is a data controller as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998. Listed below are the key services for which DSA processes personal data, with information about how and why that data is processed.

## Test booking services

Personal data is used to:

  * confirm identity and entitlement, book and provide tests and results, and create statistical management information (including analysis and research to improve road safety and customer service).
  * process payment details, which are submitted via a secure server using industry standard encryption.
  * Inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency - DVLA (another executive agency of the Department for Transport) of test passes to ensure the lawful issue of driving licences. 
  * maintain the integrity of the driving test. We may use personal data for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime and catching or prosecuting offenders. This may include hidden monitoring when appropriate.

For the purpose of administering and conducting a variety of Driver Theory Tests, Pearson Driving Assessments Limited (Pearson) act as DSA's data processors and are authorised to collect and process personal information on DSA's behalf. Personal data is processed by Pearson in both the United Kingdom and United States of America. For the USA processing, compliance with the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 is established via the US Department of Commerce's 'safe harbor' framework.

  * [Safe harbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/)

No further disclosures shall be made by DSA other than in accordance with the law, to comply with legal obligations and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

## Register of approved driving instructors (ADIs)

Personal data is used to:

  * help administer the Register of ADIs and practical driving test
  * provide statistical analysis to assess equality and improve our customer service
  * maintain the integrity of the driving test. We may use personal data for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime and catching or prosecuting offenders. This may include hidden monitoring when appropriate.
  * check the continued fitness of ADIs to remain on the register
  * DSA does not disclose or share personal data with any third parties other than in line with the Data Protection Act 1998. This may include, but is not restricted to, disclosure to the police, HM Revenue and Customs, local governments and DVLA. In the case of transfers from DVLA, this may include details of endorsements for the purpose of ensuring that registered ADIs continue to be fit to remain on the register.

In order to ensure that Potential Driving Instructors (PDIs) and ADIs are fit to be entered onto/remain on the register, DSA uses the services of the Criminal Records Bureau to obtain criminal record disclosures for individuals normally resident in England and Wales, and of Disclosure Scotland for individuals normally resident in Scotland.

## Driver certificate of professional competence (Driver CPC)

Personal data is used to:

  * record the periodic training that is necessary to qualify for the Driver CPC and for the issue of a Driver Qualification Card (DQC). Both of these functions enable professional bus and lorry drivers to comply with EU legislation.
  * confirm entitlement to relevant enforcement bodies, including the police and the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency --VOSA (another agency of the Department for Transport).
  * inform the DVLA so that they can include the Driver CPC qualification information (but not training information) on the driver's record.
  * determine, via the police or other enforcement bodies, a driver's entitlement to hold a Driver CPC in relation to a particular vehicle category.
  * maintain the integrity of the Driver CPC and issue of DQC systems. Data may be used by the DSA Fraud and Integrity Team as part of investigations into fraudulent/criminal activities and may be used as evidence for prosecuting offenders.
  * data collected will not be shared with any third parties other than for the statutory duties listed above.

The data collected will also be used by bodies working on DSA's behalf, for example, to produce DQC cards, or to provide management information to the Joint Approvals Unit for Periodic Training (JAUPT).

## Driver trainers

Personal data is used to:

  * administer the Integrated Register of Driver Trainers and other driver training registers
  * administer the practical driving test
  * provide statistical analysis to assess equality and improve customer service.

## Formal consultations and feedback forms

Any personal data provided to DSA in order to take part in a consultation will be processed by DSA for the purpose of administering the consultation. Formal responses to consultations will be retained and used to inform future policy. Further guidance is provided to individuals as part of each consultation.

## Surveys

DSA may contact you to ask you how satisfied you were with the service you received from us or one of our service providers. This contact may be by email, telephone or post. Your participation is not compulsory and your response will be anonymised before it is collated to provide management data for the agency. Where the survey relates to one of our service providers, we will not disclose information to them that would allow you to be identified.",policy-papers,making-roads-safer,,Transparency,driving-standards-agency,,,,14-Mar-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-public-sector-equality-duty,DSA and the public sector Equality Duty,The public sector Equality Duty requires public bodies to consider all individuals when carrying out their day to day work.,"## Summary

The public sector Equality Duty, at [section 149 of the Equality Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/149), requires public bodies to consider all individuals when carrying out their day to day work - in shaping policy, in delivering services and in relation to their own employees. It requires public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations between different people when carrying out their activities.

The Equality Duty supports good decision making - it encourages public bodies to understand how different people will be affected by their activities, so that their policies and services are appropriate and accessible to all and meet different people's needs. By understanding the effect of their activities on different people, and how inclusive public services can support and open up people's opportunities, public bodies can be more efficient and effective. The Equality Duty therefore helps public bodies to deliver the government's overall objectives for public services.

The compulsory basic training (CBT) syllabus and guidance notes set out for trainers what must happen on a CBT course for motorcyclists. It also gives guidance on what a learner must know and understand and what they should be able to do to show they have reached the required standard. The direct access scheme (DAS) guidance notes do the same for trainers delivering DAS training.

The motorcyclist competence framework sets out the 'building blocks' on which the standard was constructed. Through this framework it is possible to identify the original research, statistics, professional opinions, and so on, which underpin the standards.

The Department's correspondence of 5th March 2012 to the aviation security industry clarifies the requirement for certain personnel employed, under contract, in roles outside the airport Security Restricted Area to be vetted to ""background check"" status, and thus to have successfully completed a Criminal Records Check. Achieving compliance in this area is necessary in order for aviation security staff to be exempted from the requirement to obtain a Security Industry Authority licence.

## Door to door Journey Planner

![Image: door to door icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/doortodoor)

**Door-to-door Journey Planner**

The core feature of the Transport Direct Portal is the Door-to-door journey planner. A world first, this plans journeys from door to door using all feasible means of public transport anywhere in Great Britain; at the same time it can plan the journey by car, allowing the user to compare car and public transport journey options (Figure 5).

**Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys**

![Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/fig5a.jpg)

![Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/fig5b.jpg)

Once the journeys have been planned:

  * The costs of the journey options can be provided as can the CO2 emissions;
  * Tickets can be purchased from online retailers (through an automated hand-off) or telephone numbers provided for telephone-based retailers;
  * The route, or individual sections of it, can be displayed on a map;
  * Calling points for a service can be displayed;
  * All information can be printed in order to provide an informative itinerary to take on the journey.

When **connecting people to places**, it is important that users can find their journey origin and destination from appropriate gazetteers or directly from the map. Transport Direct has created a rich set of gazetteers, based on postcodes, addresses, transport locations, places and even local attractions.

[**Single mode Journey Planners**](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/JourneyPlannerInput.aspx)

![Image: single mode journey planners icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/singlejourney)

In many cases, the traveller may only want to find out about part of a journey or travelling options using specific modes. Consequently, Transport Direct provides a range of modal journey planners:

  * Find a train;
  * Find a flight;
  * Find a car route;
  * Find a coach;
  * Find a bus;
  * Find a cycle route.

**City to City Planner**

![Image: city to city icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/citytocity)

  * **Compare city-to-city journeys** - provides a summary of ""trunk"" journey planning options by train, plane and coach between two cities or transport hubs, such as airports;

**Day Trip Planner**

  * **Plan a day trip** - provides a means of creating a journey itinerary with short stopovers (for business or leisure) in one or two locations before planning the final journey back to the starting point.

**Live travel information**

![Image: live travel news icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/livetravelnews)

Transport Direct is the definitive source of travel and transport information for Great Britain. Underpinning this is Transport Direct's comprehensive provision of live travel information, sourced from authoritative sources and recognised intermediaries.

The live travel news is updated every 15 minutes and can be filtered by:

  * Region / all of Great Britain;
  * Public transport / road / all types of transport;
  * Major / recent / all delays;
  * Incidents / road & rail engineering works / all types of travel news;
  * All road or public transport incidents can also be displayed on a map for geographic referencing.

Transport Direct also provides links to up-to-the-minute arrival and departure information for rail, bus services (where provided) and flights from the definitive sources such as National Rail, Transport for London, bus service information providers and airport operators.

[**Car Parking and Park-and-Ride information**](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/LiveTravel/DepartureBoards.aspx?NotFindAMode=true)

![Image: park and ride icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/carparking)

Planning a car journey from door to door is straightforward when there is readily available on-road or off-road car parking. However, this is not always the case. Much more useful would be to plan to the nearest car park (within walking distance of the destination) or to a park-and-ride service and complete the journey by public transport.

Transport Direct has car park information for over 10,000 car parks, covering major towns and cities across Great Britain, and the range is being constantly expanded.

Using the ""find nearest car park"" service, the user can now find the nearest car park to their destination and also get information on costs and opening times. Car Parks are also shown on Transport Direct's maps, enabling journeys to be planned to and from these locations.

Transport Direct also has park-and-ride information for many cities, with details on cost and opening hours. The ""plan to park and ride"" service plans car journeys to and from the best park-and-ride location for the direction of travel to that city.

[**Calculating Carbon Emissions**](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/FindCarParkInput.aspx)

![Image: carbon calculator screen shot](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/carboncalculator)

Transport Direct launched a car ""carbon calculator"" at the end of 2006, which is believed to be another world first. This feature enables the user to calculate the amount of CO2 emitted for a specific journey planned on Transport Direct, taking account of predicted levels of congestion on the roads and so enabling greater accuracy in the calculation of the emitted CO2.

In April 2007, Transport Direct launched an equivalent public transport carbon calculator. This enables users to find out how much CO2 is emitted from their specific public transport journey and compares this with car and other modes of transport.

It should be noted that comparing car CO2 with public transport CO2 is not comparing like for like, where the predicted CO2 emission for a:

  * Car journey is based on a specified number of occupants;
  * Public transport journey is based on an estimate of the number of passengers. 

## What's New

In 2008/09 Transport Direct developed a cycle planner, based on cycle path information surveyed in specific regions.

  * [Cycle Journey Planner](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/findcycleinput.aspx)

Transport Direct has worked jointly with Cycling England, Ordnance Survey and the relevant local authorities to ensure that there is good quality information on cycling in the following areas: Aylesbury, Blackpool, Brighton, Greater Bristol (including Bath), Cambridge, Chester, Colchester, Darlington, Derby, Exeter, Lancaster, Greater Leicester, Leighton Buzzard, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Oxford, Peterborough, Shrewsbury, Southend, Stoke-on-Trent, Teesside, Tyne & Wear, West Midlands, Western Dorset, Woking, Worcester and York. 

Work is also ongoing to provide cycle planning information in more areas - please check again soon if your local area is not yet available. Our aim is to provide national coverage for cycle planning soon.

**Mobile Phone**

In July 2010 Directgov mobile launched a new door-to-door journey planner, in collaboration with Transport Direct. The new mobile service enables users to plan full, door-to-door journeys using a range of public transport including trains, buses and tube as well as by foot.

Users will choose their 'to' and 'from' destinations, and an arrival time, to receive a step-by-step guide with detailed breakdowns for each stage of the journey. The planner also provides Google maps for any parts that involve walking.

The service is available on every internet-enabled mobile phone, so you can use it anytime, anywhere to help you find where you're going.

To use the journey planner, go to m.direct.gov.uk/journey in your phone's internet browser, or text JOURNEY to 83377 and you'll be sent the link by text message (all texts are free).

## Summary of the awards

### 2012

  * [February (PDF, 33 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/rail-freight-grants/2012-02.pdf)

### 2011

  * The Department for Transport has made the following awards from the Sustainable Distribution Fund following the November 2011 Bid Round. Funding provided relates to financial years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 and is designed to support the carriage of freight by rail and water that would otherwise be carried by road. Support from this bid round is estimated to remove over 800,000 lorry journeys from the roads of Great Britain between November 2011 and March 2014. 
    1. It should be noted that the awards listed in the table are provisional maxima. In some cases, the award may not lead to a contract; in others, the amount agreed in a subsequent contract may be lower than the accepted bid. Furthermore there is no guarantee that traffic contracted in any round will continue to operate.
    2. The traffic moved under each MSRS contract is closely monitored. Where traffic levels have been lower than those in the grantees' contracts, reductions to the contract have been made. This process ensures the effective control of the budget and maximizes the amount of benefit that can be purchased through the scheme.
    3. The Department for Transport is currently running two schemes that facilitate the purchase of the environmental and social benefits that result from using rail or water transport instead of road. These are: 
      * Mode Shift Revenue Support (MSRS) scheme: assists companies with the operating costs associated with running rail and inland waterway freight transport instead of road (where rail/ inland waterways are more expensive than road).
      * Waterborne Freight Grant scheme (WFG): assists companies with the operating costs, for up to three years, associated with running coastal and short sea shipping freight transport instead of road (where short sea/ coastal shipping is more expensive than road).
    4. Applications for the Department's freight grant schemes are prioritised in a bid round process. Further details on bid rounds are available on the Department's website. Guidance and application [forms are available on the Business Link website](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=b&r.l4=1084729126&r.l1=1081597476&r.lc=en&r.l3=1084756086&r.l2=1082103262&topicId=1084756086)

Whether it is labelled light rapid transit, light rail or tram, this mode of transport is popular with passengers. It is also good for economic growth and good for reducing carbon, both key objectives of the Coalition government.

During more than a century of development, light rail has proved itself an effective and efficient means of taking large numbers of passengers directly into and around the heart of a city, connecting communities and supporting businesses. The fact that, even against a uniquely difficult financial backdrop, we have announced since May 2010 our financial support for a number of light rail extensions in England demonstrates very clearly our belief in the benefits that light rail can provide

When moving around the pedestrian environment, visually impaired people will actively seek and make use of tactile information underfoot, particularly detectable contrasts in surface texture.

The ability to detect contrasts in texture underfoot varies from one individual to another. For example, older visually impaired people and people who have lost their sight through certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, may well have reduced sensitivity in their feet. It is therefore important that textures warning of potential hazards, for example a road crossing or a staircase, are rigorous  
enough to be detectable by most people but without constituting a trip hazard or causing extreme discomfort.

### Purpose of this guidance

1.1 _Planning Policy Guidance Note 13: Transport_ (PPG13) states that, where a new development is likely to have significant transport implications, a Transport Assessment (TA) should be prepared and submitted with a planning application for the development. It will then be used to determine whether the impact of the development on transport is acceptable. TAs are normally produced by developers and are used by decision makers in the planning process.

1.2 A TA is a comprehensive and systematic process that sets out transport issues relating to a proposed development. It identifies what measures will be taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the scheme and to improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling and public transport.

1.3 In some cases, the transport issues arising out of development proposals may not require a full TA to inform the process adequately and identify suitable mitigation. In these instances, it has become common practice to produce a simplified report in the form of a Transport Statement (TS). There will also be situations where the transport issues relating to a development proposal are limited, and no formal assessment is necessary.

1.4 This document, _Guidance on Transport Assessment_ (GTA), is intended to assist stakeholders in determining whether an assessment may be required and, if so, what the level and scope of that assessment should be. It provides guidance on the content and preparation of TAs and TSs.

1.5 However, it is not a statement of Government policy and therefore should be read in conjunction with, and in the context of, relevant Government policies, in particular those relating to transport and planning. It is also important to note that the decision to grant planning permission for a development proposal is based on several considerations. A TA focuses primarily on the transport implications of the development, and therefore the completion of a TA does not guarantee the granting of planning consent.

1.6 This guidance applies to England only, and not Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Developers should also have regard to any more specific current guidance issued by local authorities. In particular, developers operating in the vicinity of London should note the guidance issued by Transport for London (TfL). Planning applications meeting the criteria for referral to the Mayor should follow TfL's Transport Assessment best practice guidance (May 2006).

### Policy context

1.7 The previous guidance on the assessment of the transport implications of development proposals was the _Guidelines for Traffic Impact Assessment_, published by the Institution of Highways and Transportation (IHT) in 1994. Since the IHT guidelines were produced, there has been a significant change in Government policy and general guidance regarding improved sustainability in transport.

1.8 This document brings the guidance on transport assessment up to date with these changes in Government policy. It expands the scope of the guidance to cover the assessment of the potential implications of development proposals on the entire transport system, including the public transport system (buses, rail and trams), the Strategic Road Network (SRN), local highways and footways.

1.9 The Government first published its Sustainable Development Strategy in 1994, following the 1992 Earth Summit. The Strategy was revised in 1999 and again in 2005, with the publication of _Securing the Future_. The Strategy has set the context for the Government's transport and planning policies, with sustainable development and sustainable communities at their core. 

1.10 _Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development_ (PPS1) describes the Government's objectives for the planning system. Sustainable development is the main principle underpinning planning. Planning has a key role to play in the creation of sustainable communities: communities that will stand the test of time, where people want to live, and which will enable people to meet their aspirations and potential.

1.11 _Managing Our Roads_ (DfT, 2003) and _The Future of Transport - a Network for 2030_ (DfT White Paper, 2004) set out the Government's long-term strategy for transport. An underlying objective of the strategy set out in the White Paper is to deal with the pressures of increasing demand for travel by striking the right balance among our environmental, economic and social objectives, now and into the future. In terms of the road network, this means:

  * new capacity, where it is needed and justified on environmental and social grounds; 
  * locking in the benefits of new capacity through measures such as high occupancy vehicle lanes and tolling, where appropriate; 
  * the Government leading the debate on road pricing and the opportunity this gives to motorists to make better choices; 
  * better management of the network; and 
  * using new technology, so the travelling public can make smarter journey choices.

In terms of enhancing local travel, this means:

  * freer-flowing local roads delivered through measures such as congestion charging; 
  * more, and more reliable buses enjoying more road space; 
  * demand-responsive bus services that provide accessibility in areas that cannot support conventional services; 
  * looking at ways to make services more accessible, so that people have a real choice about when and how they travel; 
  * tackling the environmental impacts of travel by encouraging more sustainable travel choices through promoting the use of school travel plans, workplace travel plans and personalised journey planning, and encouraging people to consider alternatives to using their cars; and 
  * creating a culture and improved quality of local environment, so that cycling and walking are seen as an attractive alternative to car travel for short journeys, particularly for children.

1.12 _The Future of Transport and Future of Rail_ White Papers (DfT, 2004) set out the Government's approach to the rail industry, and for the use of rail in providing alternatives to road travel for people and freight. The railways are a vital part of the country's transport infrastructure, and the Government wants to see this continue and accelerate.

1.13 _PPG 13_:_ Transport_ describes the link between planning and transport policy. The objectives of this guidance are to integrate planning and transport at the national, regional, strategic and local level. This is in order to promote more sustainable transport choices both for people and moving freight; promote accessibility to jobs, shopping, leisure facilities and services by public transport, walking and cycling; and reduce the need to travel, especially by car.

1.14 The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 reformed the planning system to place a renewed emphasis on sustainable development and strengthen the role of regional planning, replacing Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) with statutory Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS). _Planning Policy Statement 11: Regional Spatial Strategies_ describes the role of RSSs in setting out a spatial vision for each region across a 15-20-year period and a broad development strategy to achieve that vision. RSSs incorporate Regional Transport Strategies (RTSs) that outline the transport measures needed to support the spatial strategy and provide a long-term framework to integrate transport and spatial planning in the region. Together, they provide a spatial framework that informs the preparation of the Local Development Documents (LDDs) and Local Transport Plans (LTPs) that set out local planning authorities' policies and proposals for the development of their area.

1.15 The role of transport in securing sustainable development is also set out within PPS1. It identifies the role of planning in facilitating and promoting sustainable and inclusive patterns of urban and rural development. Key elements in achieving more sustainable patterns of development include: encouraging more efficient use of land; managing the pattern of development to reduce the need to travel; promoting accessibility to jobs, shopping, leisure facilities and services by public transport, walking and cycling, in particular by focusing major trip generating development in existing centres and near to public transport interchanges.

1.16 The draft _Planning Policy Statement Planning and Climate_ (which will act as a supplement to _Planning Policy Statement 1_) sets out how planning, in providing for the new homes, jobs and infrastructure needed by communities, should help shape places with lower carbon emissions and which are resilient to the climate change now accepted as inevitable. The PPS expects planning to be a positive force for change and help secure progress against the UK's emissions targets, both by direct influence on energy use and emissions, and in bringing together and encouraging action by others. It should also help deliver the Government's ambition of zero carbon development and give communities real opportunities to take action on climate change.

1.17 Finally, the Traffic Management Act 2004 places a network management duty on local traffic authorities in England. They have a duty to manage their road network with a view to securing the expeditious movement of traffic on the authority's road network, which implies a network that is working efficiently without unnecessary delay to those travelling on it, and facilitating it on road networks for which another authority is the traffic authority. The duty is not limited to the actions of the traffic department within an authority. It extends to the authority exercising its powers as highway authority and street authority under the Highways Act 1980 and the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, and indeed any power to regulate or co-ordinate the uses made of any road.

### Principles of the assessment

1.18 A properly prepared TA will help LPAs assess the development's compatibility with the relevant planning policy framework (usually the Local Development Framework) and, in particular, the relevant transport strategy (usually the Local Transport Plan). It will allow the transport implications of proposed developments to be properly considered and, where appropriate, will help identify suitable measures to achieve a more sustainable and environmentally sound outcome. A TA can also address issues likely to be of concern to the local traffic authority (and the Highways Agency where relevant) in performing their network management duties.

1.19 In preparing a transport assessment the following considerations will therefore be relevant.

#### Encouraging environmental sustainability 

  * **Reducing the need to travel, especially by car** - reducing the need for travel, reducing the length of trips, and promoting multi-purpose or linked trips by promoting more sustainable patterns of development and more sustainable communities that reduce the physical separation of key land uses. 
  * **Tackling the environmental impact of travel** - by improving sustainable transport choices, and by making it safer and easier for people to access jobs, shopping, leisure facilities and services by public transport, walking, and cycling. 
  * **The accessibility of the location** - the extent to which a site is, or is capable of becoming, accessible by non car modes, particularly for large developments that involve major generators of travel demand. 
  * **Other measures which may assist in influencing travel behaviour (ITB)** - achieving reductions in car usage (particularly single occupancy vehicles), by measures such as car sharing/pooling, High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes and parking control.

#### Managing the existing network

  * **Making best possible use of existing transport infrastructure** - for instance by low-cost improvements to the local public transport network and using advanced signal control systems, public transport priority measures (bus lanes), or other forms of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to improve operations on the highway network. It should be noted that the capacity of the existing public transport infrastructure and footpaths is finite, and in some areas overcrowding already exists. 
  * **Managing access to the highway network** - taking steps to maximise the extent to which the development can be made to 'fit' within the available capacity by managing access from developments onto the highway network.

#### Mitigating residual impacts

  * **Through demand management** - using traffic control measures across a wide network to regulate flows. 
  * **Through improvements to the local public transport network, and walking and cycling facilities** - for example, by extending bus routes and increasing bus frequencies, and designing sites to facilitate walking and cycling. 
  * **Through minor physical improvements to existing roads** - it may be possible in some circumstances to improve the capacity of existing roads by relatively minor physical adjustments such as improving the geometry of junctions etc. within the existing highway boundary. 
  * **Through provision of new or expanded roads** - it is considered good transport planning practice to demonstrate that the other opportunities above have been fully explored before considering the provision of additional road space such as new roads or major junction upgrades.

1.20 Consideration of these matters should take place at an early stage in the process of preparing a development proposal. Work on developing the transport assessment can then help inform, and be informed by, discussions about the location of the site and the scale and mix of uses proposed.

### Structure of the guidance 

1.21 The guidance is divided into four further sections:

1.22 **Section 2: Identifying the need for an assessment**: PPG13 states that it will not always be necessary for development proposals to be accompanied by a full and detailed Transport Assessment (TA). This section provides guidance on when assessments are likely to be needed and, if so, what level of assessment is likely to be required. For large-scale developments, pre-application discussions with the local authority are critical to establish clearly the scope of what is required.

1.23 **Section 3: Preparing a Transport Statement**: This form of assessment is suitable when the proposed development is expected to generate relatively low numbers of trips or traffic flows, with minor transport impacts. This section provides guidance on the type of information typically required in a TS.

1.24 **Section 4: Preparing a Transport Assessment**: A TA is required where a development is likely to have significant transport impacts. The precise scope and detail of a TA will vary depending on the site location, scale and nature of the development. Section 4 provides a step-by-step guide to the approach and sets out the key elements that should underpin the preparation of TAs. It also explains the role of a supporting travel plan in delivering sustainable outcomes and provides links to guidance on preparing a travel plan.

1.25 **Section 5: The link with the development-plan-making process**: Regional Spatial Strategies and Local Development Frameworks should be sound: their evidence base should be robust and credible. This section identifies how the plan-making process can inform, and be informed by, transport assessments.

## Chapter 2: Identifying the need for an assessment

### Pre-application discussions

2.1 PPS1 and PPG13 emphasise the value of early discussions in relation to transport assessments. This ensures that all parties have a better understanding of, and reach a consensus on, the key issues to be addressed in respect of a particular development proposal. The issues agreed in such pre-application discussions should indicate the level and scope of assessment that will be required. They will also provide an initial judgement on the need for and scope of a travel plan.

2.2 Pre-application discussions should be held with the Local Planning Authority (LPA), Local Transport Authority (LTA) or Local Highway Authority (LHA) regarding the local transport network. In addition, where there might be an impact on the SRN, discussions should be held with the Highways Agency (HA).

2.3 When an assessment is likely to be required, as a first step in the process, developers should ensure that a brief description of their proposals and information on the likely transport impacts is made available to the relevant authorities.

2.4 A pro-forma has been developed (see Appendix A) to inform LPAs/LHAs. This is intended to provide sufficient information to help them make objective judgements on the transport implications of development proposals and on the appropriate level of assessment.

2.5 Whilst there is no requirement on applicants to complete such a pre-application form, or for LPAs/LHAs to use a standard form, its use is recommended. It provides benefits to all parties involved and, even if a pre-application form is not completed, it would be helpful if the information in the suggested pro-forma is provided by other means.

2.6 Where a pre-application form has been prepared, the completed form should provide an indication of the nature and scale of the proposed development, together with estimates of the likely number of trips to be generated and the likely mode share. This structured approach will assist negotiations with the LPA and, more broadly, the LTA/LHA, rail and bus service operators and, where the SRN may be affected, the HA.

2.7 In assessing the need for a TA, regard should be had to relevant policies and development allocations in the development plan, particularly where these were informed by transport assessments. The development plan, under the reforms introduced by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, usually consists of a Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) and Local Development Documents (LDDs), with the previous system of Structure Plans and Local Plans being phased out in some areas. Attention should also be paid to the RTS and LTP.

### When an assessment is needed

2.8 The need for, and level of, formal transport assessment will be determined in consultation between the developer and the relevant authorities (LPA, LTA, LHA and HA).

2.9 If an assessment is required, there are two levels:

  * Transport Statement (TS) (see Section 3): development that has relatively small transport implications. 
  * Transport Assessment (TA) (see Section 4): development that has significant transport implications

2.10 As will be set out later in this guidance, there may be a need to include specific assessment of environmental impacts of the development proposals. These could arise out of an incremental rise in transport-related noise, air quality or other pollutions. The aim will be to identify potential breaches of statutory thresholds and mitigation measures to address such impacts. 

2.11 Appendix B provides suggested thresholds below which a formal assessment may not be needed, and above which the preparation of a TS or a TA would be appropriate. The thresholds in Appendix B are based upon scenarios which would typically generate 30 two way peak hour vehicle trips. Whilst there is no suggestion that 30 two-way peak hour vehicle trips would, in themselves, cause a detrimental impact, it is a useful point of reference from which to commence discussions.

2.12 A Person Trip is a one-way journey by one person by any mode of transport, including walking, cycling, privately operated vehicles, or any public transport modes. A Vehicle Trip is a one-way journey by a single privately operated vehicle regardless of the number of persons in the vehicle. For example, two or more people travelling together in a car would be counted as one vehicle trip. The criteria for determining the need for an assessment use two-way trips throughout as a standard for assessing travel. Traffic refers to motorised trips on the road network.

2.13 These thresholds are for guidance purposes and should not be read as absolutes. There are a range of qualitative factors that need to be taken into account that the thresholds do not necessarily capture. There will also be site-specific issues that assessments will need to take into account. In some circumstances, a TA may be appropriate for a smaller development than suggested by the thresholds in Appendix B. In others, a TS may be appropriate for a larger development than suggested by the thresholds in Appendix B - for example, where there is an extant permission for one form of development but an alternative development that involves a smaller projected transport impact is now proposed. Early pre-application discussions between a developer and the relevant authorities are strongly recommended. In these, it is important for highway authorities to combine the appropriate quantitative and qualitative thresholds in deciding the level of assessment that may be required.

### Key issues

2.14 The key issues to be addressed during any pre-application consultations include the following:

  * Planning policy context of development proposal 
  * Catchments or study area for the proposed development 
  * Assessment years - year of opening and horizon year(s) 
  * Assessment of public transport capacity, walking/cycling capacity and the road network capacity 
  * Person trip generation and trip distribution methodologies and/or assumptions 
  * Measures to promote sustainable travel 
  * Mitigation measures (where applicable) - scope and implementation strategy

2.15 The above list is not exhaustive and there may be additional issues that are site-specific and reflect local conditions, as well as other material considerations.

## Chapter 3: Preparing a transport statement

3.1 A Transport Statement should set out the transport issues relating to a proposed development site (existing conditions) and details of the development proposals (proposed development).

### Existing conditions

3.2 The developer should provide a full description of:

  * existing site information - describing the current physical infrastructure and characteristics of the site and its surroundings; 
  * baseline transport data - background transport data and current transport infrastructure details.

3.3 This information should be accurately established to understand the context of the development proposal. The description should include as a minimum:

#### Existing site information

  * a site location plan that shows the proposed development site in relation to the surrounding area and transport system; 
  * the permitted and existing use of the site; 
  * the existing land uses in the vicinity of the site, including development plan allocations, or potential future use in the case of undeveloped sites; 
  * existing site access arrangements including access constraints, where appropriate; 
  * whether the location of the site is within or near a designated Air Quality Management Area (AQMA); 
  * any abnormal load uses of the current site.

#### Baseline transport data

  * a qualitative description of the travel characteristics of the existing site, including pedestrian and cyclist movements and facilities, where applicable; 
  * existing public transport provision, including provision/frequency of services, location of bus stops/train stations, park-and-ride facilities; 
  * a description and functional classification of the highway network in the vicinity of the site; 
  * an analysis of the injury accident records on the public highway in the vicinity of the site access for the most recent three-year period, or five-year period if the proposed site has been identified as within a high accident area.

### Proposed development

3.4 The developer should provide a full description within the TS including, as a minimum:

  * plans and drawings showing the proposed site layout, particularly the proposed pedestrian and vehicular access points into the site; 
  * the proposed land use; 
  * the scale of development, such as numbers of residential units and/or gross floor area (GFA), subdivided by land use where appropriate; 
  * the main features (design layout and access points) of the development; 
  * the person-trip generation of the proposed development and distribution of trips across mode; 
  * a qualitative and quantitative description (based on recent site observations) of the travel characteristics of the proposed development, including pedestrian and cyclist facilities/movements, in the vicinity of the site; 
  * proposed improvements to site accessibility via sustainable modes of travel, such as provision/enhancement of footpath and cycle path linkages, public transport improvements, and servicing arrangements where appropriate; 
  * a proposed parking strategy1 and internal vehicular circulation (including number of spaces, parking accumulation, parking layout in relation to other site elements, ratio of operational to non-operational spaces, method of car park operation, overspill parking considerations, disabled parking, motorcycle parking, cycle parking, taxi drop-off points); 
  * residual vehicular trip impact; 
  * the transport impacts of site construction, including the requirements of abnormal loads in the construction, use and decommissioning the present development; 
  * the transport impacts of freight or service operations; and 
  * if the site of the proposed development has a current use or an extant planning permission with trip patterns/volumes, the net level of change that might arise out of the new proposals should be set out.

3.5 The above requirements are not exhaustive and there may be a need for supplementary information that takes account of local conditions as well as other material considerations. However, not all proposed developments that are considered to require a TS would necessarily need all of the above matters to be considered. Therefore, it is important that the scope of the TS is agreed at the pre-application discussion stage between the developer and appropriate authorities.

## Chapter 4: Preparing a transport assessment

### Introduction

4.1 A detailed TA will be required where a proposed development is likely to have significant transport and related environmental impacts. The study area for a proposed development should be determined in discussion between the developer and appropriate authorities. It will generally depend on the type and scale of the development, and early consultations with the appropriate authorities will assist in defining its extent. A description of the study area should include reference to the site location, the local transport network and relevant transport features. Guidelines on when a TA may be required are provided in the thresholds table in Appendix B.

4.2 Wherever pre-application consultation identifies a need for a TA, it is good practice to agree, as part of the pre-application consultation, the preparation of a scoping study before the TA is begun. A scoping study should identify the issues the TA will address, the methodologies to be adopted, additional supporting data required, and the limits of the assessment area. An agreed scoping study will help to reduce the potential for misunderstandings about the form of the TA and avoid abortive work. It does not preclude varying the TA to reflect the findings of survey results or more detailed analysis. However, it is recommended that any significant variations are agreed with the appropriate authorities during the development of the TA.

4.3 Figure 4.1 illustrates an iterative approach to transport assessments. A TA should address the following issues: 

  * Reducing the need to travel, especially by car - ensure, at the outset, that thought is given to reducing the need to travel; consider the types of uses (or mix of uses) and the scale of development in order to promote multipurpose or linked trips. 
  * Sustainable accessibility - promote accessibility by all modes of travel, in particular public transport, cycling and walking; assess the likely travel behaviour or travel pattern to and from the proposed site; and develop appropriate measures to influence travel behaviour. 
  * Dealing with residual trips - provide accurate quantitative and qualitative analyses of the predicted impacts of residual trips from the proposed development and ensure that suitable measures are proposed to manage these impacts. 
  * Mitigation measures - ensure as much as possible that the proposed mitigation measures avoid unnecessary physical improvements to highways and promote innovative and sustainable transport solutions.

![Figure 4.1 Flow chart: An iterative approach to transport assessment for a typical assessment approach](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081022144403/http://stage-dft.dft.gov.uk/144130/165192/figure42?link-ref=202616)

4.4 An iterative approach may be necessary where initial work on a TA indicates that revisions may be necessary to the proposed development, or to the approach taken to the issues identified in paragraph 4.3. The iterative approach ensures that the stages of the TA are not viewed in isolation, but that the full implications of each stage are thought through and revisions made either to the development proposal or to measures considered at another stage. Where revisions are made, their implications are analysed across the whole proposal in turn. The final outcome is a TA that improves the development proposal to achieve the optimum level of sustainability.

4.5 The basic components in the process of producing a Transport Assessment or, at a lower level, a Transport Statement, are given in Figure 4.2.

![Figure 4.2 Flow chart: Road map and contents of a transport assessment report](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081022144403/http://stage-dft.dft.gov.uk/144130/165192/figure42?link-ref=202616)

### Development proposal and planning policy framework

4.6 A TA should be prepared with regard to the relevant planning policy framework for the development proposal, usually the RSS/LDF. It should also be consistent with the RTS/LTP. The TA should indicate the transport aspects of the proposal, how the proposal will help to deliver the aims and objectives of the development plan, and how it responds to relevant Government planning policy guidance and statements.

### Existing conditions

4.7 In preparing a TA, a full description of existing site information should be provided by the developer. These baseline conditions need to be established accurately to understand fully the context of the development proposal. This description should include as a minimum:

#### Existing site information

  * a site location plan that shows the proposed development site in relation to the surrounding area and transport system; 
  * the permitted and existing use of the site; 
  * a detailed description of the existing land uses in the vicinity of the site, including development plan allocations or potential future uses in the case of undeveloped sites; 
  * existing site access layout and access constraints, where appropriate; 
  * whether the location of the site is within or near a designated Air Quality Management Area (AQMA); 
  * any abnormal load uses of the current site;

#### Baseline transport data

  * the quantification of the person trips generated from the existing site and their modal distribution, or, where the site is vacant or partially vacant, the person trips which might realistically be generated by any extant planning permission or permitted uses; 
  * existing public transport facilities (including provision/frequency of services, location of bus stops/train stations, park-and-ride facilities) in the study area; if available, the current level of patronage or usage on the public transport network in the vicinity of the site; 
  * parking facilities available in the vicinity of the site; 
  * existing pedestrian and cycle facilities in the vicinity of the site; 
  * pedestrian and cyclists movements in the vicinity of the site; 
  * a description and functional classification of the road network in the vicinity of the site; 
  * current traffic flows on links and at junctions within the study area; 
  * identification of the critical links and junctions on the highway network, with calibrated capacity tests to reflect existing conditions; 
  * for the study area, establish the current personal injury accident records for the most recent three-year period, or five years if this is considered to be more appropriate; 
  * a summary of planned transport improvements within the study area (including type of improvement, implementation schedule and sponsoring agency or highway authority); 
  * identify current peak periods on the adjacent road network and, as required, daily traffic flow data to and from the development site or in the vicinity of the site; 
  * levels for air quality and noise for the highway network at the site entrance and any other locations where statutory limits might be breached by additional development traffic; 
  * baseline carbon emissions data for the site, broken down by mode.

4.8 The requirements above are not exhaustive and further supplementary information may be required to take account of local conditions and other material considerations. Equally, some developments requiring a TA may not need to cover all of the points above. Therefore, it is important that the scope of work at this stage is agreed during the preapplication consultation process. 

### Public transport assessment

4.9 A key issue in seeking the most sustainable solution for a particular development is the need to encourage the use of public transport. In addition to the basic data collection described in paragraph 4.7, an assessment should be made of the available capacity on the existing public transport infrastructure relevant to the development. The capacity of a public transport route or service is the maximum number of people that can be accommodated on the route within the licensing laws of that particular mode. 

4.10 For major developments, it is important to identify the spare capacity on buses, trains and trams in order to establish the ability of the public transport network to accommodate any increase in demand associated with a proposed development. This is particularly important when considering rail network capacity, which is generally more problematic to expand than the bus network. 

4.11 Such assessments will inform later stages in the TA process in respect of determining modal split, travel plan objectives and in appropriate cases, public transport infrastructure enhancement as part of an overall mitigation package.

4.12 A suggested methodology for assessing the capacity of the public transport network includes the following: 

  * Identify the analysis period, particularly the peak hours of the development and/or the entire transport system; 
  * Establish the total person trip generation from the proposed development for all travel modes; 
  * Estimate the likely modal split for the public transport network (buses, rail and tram); 
  * Identify the public transport services relevant to, and in the vicinity of, the proposed development; 
  * Estimate the existing capacity of the bus/train/tram service by multiplying the number of services by the maximum passenger capacity for each mode (bus, train carriages); 
  * Estimate the current level of patronage or usage on the public transport network, using the most comprehensive data publicly available; 
  * Estimate the spare capacity on the public transport network; 
  * Identify measures to address any shortfall in capacity, where applicable.

4.13 The methodology suggested above is intended to provide a general framework for assessing the capacity of the public transport network. It is important that further guidance is sought from the relevant authorities and public transport operators.

### Walking/cycling assessment

4.14 Another key issue in assessing the sustainability of a development's location will be its accessibility for those walking and cycling. In addition to the basic data collection described in paragraph 4.7, an assessment should be made of the available capacity of the existing cycleway and footpath network in the area of the development. This assessment will help to inform the later stages of the TA process in respect of determining modal split, and travel plan objectives. It will also indicate what enhancements, if any, are required to the local cycleway and footpath network. These assessments should be undertaken using the appropriate analytical tools and methodologies, as agreed with the relevant authorities.

### Road network assessment

4.15 In addition to assessing the public transport capacity and walking/cycling capacity, an assessment of the available vehicular capacity on the road network in the vicinity of the site should be undertaken in order to establish the potential impacts from the development, as well as the likely mitigation measures that may be required to sustain the development.

4.16 Consideration should be given to the available parking facilities in the vicinity of the site and the impact that development could have upon them. This assessment should be made in the context of the parking strategy set by the local planning authority.

4.17 These assessments should be undertaken using the appropriate analytical tools and methodologies, as agreed with the relevant highway authorities.

### Traffic data and traffic forecast

4.18 The assessment should include recent counts (normally surveyed within the last three years) for peak period turning movements at critical junctions. In certain instances, for example, where there is known to be a significant level of heavy goods vehicles (HGV) traffic, a classified count should be provided.2  Additional counts that may be required could include:

  * manual turning counts (should be conducted at 15-minute intervals) to identify all relevant highway network peak periods; 
  * 12-hour/24-hour automatic traffic counts (ATC); 
  * queue length surveys at signal junctions to establish demand and actual traffic flows; 
  * journey time surveys; 
  * freight counts; 
  * abnormal load counts; 
  * pedestrian and cyclists counts.

4.19 The traffic data should reflect the normal traffic flow conditions on the transport network (e.g. non-school holiday periods, typical weather conditions etc.) in the vicinity of the site, and should be valid for the intended purposes. It should also take account of holiday periods in tourist areas, where peaks could occur in periods that might normally be considered non-neutral. The recommended periods for data collection are spring and autumn, which include the neutral months of April, May, June, September and October as described in DMRB Volume 13, Section 1, Part 4.

4.20 The criteria for the use of historical traffic data in a TA should be agreed by the LPA together with the appropriate highway authority at the pre-application stage.

4.21 Where there is a need to project existing or historical traffic data for future year assessments, the preferred option is the use of appropriate local traffic forecasts (such as TEMPRO), provided they offer a robust assessment. In some cases, National Road Traffic Forecast (NRTF) growth rates would be appropriate.

4.22 The use of any area-wide traffic models or background growth rates should be agreed with the LPA in conjunction with the relevant highway authority at the pre-application stage.

### Safety considerations and accident analysis

4.23 The assessment should also identify any significant highway safety issues and provide an analysis of the recent accident history of the study area. The extent of the safety issue considerations and accident analysis will depend on the scale of the proposed development and its location. The need to minimise conflicts between vehicles and other road-user groups should be adequately addressed.

4.24 Critical locations on the road network with poor accident records should be identified. This is to determine if the proposed development will exacerbate existing problems or, if proposed, whether highway mitigation works or traffic management measures will help to alleviate the problems. The accident records at a particular location should be compared with local average accident rates. Where the SRN is involved, it is recommended that appropriate national statistics are also used as a comparison. 

4.25 Site inspections should be conducted to determine if the proposed location and design of access roads (including visibility/sight distance restrictions) would create an increased potential for accidents. Local authorities should take account of the likely effect on road safety of any modification, and should require road safety audits where appropriate.

### Proposed development

4.26 A detailed description of the proposed use or uses of the site should be provided. This should include as a minimum:

  * site plan - provide plans and drawings showing site location and site layout and use; 
  * describe all the proposed land uses; 
  * scale of development - such as the number of residential units or gross floor area (GFA) of development - subdivided by land use where appropriate; 
  * site area in hectares; 
  * hours of operation - specify a weekly profile, including weekends where appropriate, over a 16 or 24 hour period. If the operation is seasonal, then this also needs to be specified; 
  * proposed access - describe arrangements, locations and method of linkage to existing transport infrastructure for all modes of travel (private cars, public transport, cycling, walking); 
  * servicing arrangements - describe routes and facilities for service vehicles; 
  * the traffic impacts of site construction works, including the requirements of abnormal loads in the construction, use and decommissioning of the present development; 
  * proposed parking strategy (number of spaces, parking accumulation, parking layout in relation to other site elements, ratio of operational to non-operational spaces, method of car park operation, overspill parking considerations, establishment of/proximity to controlled parking zones, disabled parking, motorcycle parking, cycle parking); 
  * development phasing (where applicable) - provide years of first and full occupation, as well as intermediate years if appropriate.

4.27 The above requirements are not exhaustive and will require adaptation to reflect the type and scale of the proposed development.

### Appraising the impact of the proposed development

4.28 PPG13 (Appendix C) states that LPAs should ensure that their approach to planning for local infrastructure is compatible with the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA).3

4.29 Throughout the NATA process, the Government's five objectives for transport as outlined in A New Deal for Transport and _A New Deal for Trunk Roads_ White Papers are central:

  * **Environmental** impact involves reducing the direct and indirect impacts of transport facilities on the environment of both users and non-users. There are ten sub-objectives, including reducing noise, atmospheric pollution (including that related to climate change and local air quality), impacts on countryside, wildlife, ancient monuments and historic buildings. See _The Environmental Objective_ (TAG Unit 3.3); 
  * **Safety** is concerned with reducing the loss of life, injuries and damage to property resulting from transport incidents and crime. The two sub-objectives are to reduce accidents and improve security. See _The Safety Objective_ (TAG Unit 3.4); 
  * **Economy** is concerned with improving the economic efficiency of transport. The five sub-objectives are to improve economic efficiency for consumers, business users and providers of transport, improve reliability and the wider economic impacts, and get good value for money in relation to impacts on public accounts. See _The Economy Objective_ (TAG Unit 3.5); 
  * **Accessibility** is concerned with the ability with which people can reach different locations and facilities by different modes. See _The Accessibility Objective_ (TAG Unit 3.6); 
  * **Integration** aims to ensure that all decisions are taken in the context of the Government's integrated transport policy. See _The Integration Objective_ (TAG Unit 3.7).

4.30 Although this approach is typically applied when planning for local transport infrastructure, adopting this approach for TAs will ensure that a proposed development's impacts are considered in the context of two alternative scenarios - 'with development' and 'without development' - and will enable a comparative analysis of the transport effects of allowing the development to take place.

4.31 A TA should adopt the principles of NATA by assessing the potential impacts of a development proposal within the framework of the five NATA objectives. The following paragraphs summarise the issues that should be considered. For most TAs the full methodology recommended in NATA will not be appropriate. The Highways Agency's Project Appraisal Report System may provide some useful guidance on methods more appropriate in these cases. TAs involving major new transport infrastructure should, however, employ the methods set out in NATA.

#### Accessibility

4.32 Developers or promoters of sites should undertake accessibility modelling to establish the level of accessibility of the site, and the results should be included within the TA.

4.33 The accessibility issues that should be assessed include:

  * access to the transport system - locating access points and links for pedestrians and cyclists to the wider transport network; 
  * access to the local area - providing transport nodes or interchanges for the proposed development that will benefit other developments and the local community as a whole; 
  * community severance - ensuring that the development does not create barriers to access within the local community.

4.34 In order to determine the level of accessibility (in respect of public transport, cycling and walking) for a specific site, or relative levels of accessibility for multiple sites, the preferred methodology would be to undertake accessibility modelling. This can be achieved by using a standard assessment tool such as ACCESSION,4 or any other appropriate tool.

#### Safety

4.35 The safety issues that should be assessed, including and in addition to the highway accident statistics described in paragraph 4.7, include:

  * the potential for development-related or other transport accidents in the vicinity of the site; and 
  * perception of personal insecurity in and around the development site.

#### Economy

4.36 The economy issues that should be assessed include:

  * Government regeneration objectives (e.g. use of brownfield sites); 
  * non-motorised road users' journey time;5
  * motorised road users' journey time reliability; 
  * user costs;6
  * the construction, land, preparation, supervision and subsequent maintenance costs of development proposals (including mitigation works).

4.37 In addition to public transport and pedestrian/cycle accessibility, accessibility modelling tools may be used to calculate vehicle journey times as an extension to the work undertaken by developers to address accessibility issues in their TA.

#### Environment

4.38 The environment issues that should be assessed include:

  * nuisance to people caused by transport-related noise and vibration generated by the development; 
  * the emission of greenhouse gases as a result of the transport implications of the development and the impact of changes in local air quality on people; 
  * the transport-related impacts of the development on areas of designated landscape importance; 
  * whether the site is in an air quality management zone or is likely to cause a breach of current legislation; 
  * the transport-related impact of the development on areas of nature conservation or biodiversity and Earth heritage interests (such as geology) where they interact with roads; 
  * heritage of historic resources where they interact with development-generated transport and/or proposed mitigation measures; 
  * the transport-related impact of the development on the townscape; 
  * appraisal of the transport-related impacts of the development on the water environment; 
  * the impact of the transport implications of the development on physical fitness; 
  * journey ambience.

4.39 The potential for environmental impacts that would breach a statutory limit should be addressed. LHAs and the HA have a statutory duty to prevent a breach of statutory limits (e.g. air quality) due to incremental change of volumes of vehicular traffic on their networks.

4.40 If a development is likely to generate significant vehicle trips on the local highway network or SRN, which in turn would be likely to cause a breach of statutory limits, the relevant authority could be held legally responsible if a breach were to occur. In these circumstances, the developer may be required to propose mitigation measures that will avoid such a breach. If a breach remains likely, this could be a material consideration in the assessment of the planning application and may result in the refusal of planning permission.

4.41 Therefore, where a development proposal is likely to generate significant traffic-related environmental impacts, the TA should address such matters. Alternatively, if the development requires a formal environmental impact assessment (EIA), which deals with these issues separately, this should be cross-referenced in the TA.

4.42 In any event, it is likely that the developer would be required to provide mitigation measures to address any adverse environmental impacts arising from the proposed development and not simply those where breaches of statutory limits may be likely to occur.

4.43 A summary of the key environmental issues relating to transport, including potential impacts and reference documents containing the relevant policies and statutes, is provided in Appendix C. Further clarification should be sought from the Environment Agency (EA).

#### Integration

4.44 The integration issues that should be assessed include:

  * the potential for the development to influence interaction among all transport modes (motorised and non-motorised), either in isolation or in combination with other developments; 
  * interaction between the development proposal and wider issues of Government policy such as environmental sustainability and health; 
  * integration of the development proposals with local, regional and national land use policies; 
  * bringing communities together/social inclusion; 
  * separating communities as a result of cutting off existing movement paths - severance/social exclusion.

4  ACCESSION - Geographical Information System based accessibility computer analysis tool to measure journey distances and times for all modes of travel between points (see web-link www.accessionGIS.com)

5  The aim is to bring about an improvement (reduction) in non-motorised journey times between origins and destinations.

6  This aspect of comparative assessment is related to the identification of any potential incremental change in the costs of travel due to implementation of the development proposals.

### Assessment years

4.45 The assessment year(s) in respect of capacity analysis for the transport network should be consistent with the size, scale and completion schedule of the proposed development, and that of other major developments in the vicinity of the site, as well as planned improvements to the transport system.

4.46 The appropriate horizon assessment year should be agreed with the relevant authorities during pre-application consultations.

4.47 In addition to the opening year, one or two further assessment years should be considered. For the local transport network, a development should be assessed with regard to the LDF, and for a period of no less than five years after the date of registration of a planning application. Should the development take place over a longer period, it would be appropriate to extend the length of the assessment period. The development proposal should be supported by an acceptable TA, carried out in accordance with the GTA. This will help to ensure that the transport impacts of the development are more accurately applied to a situation where all committed local transportation infrastructure improvements are in place.

4.48 For the SRN, the future assessment year should normally be ten years after the date of registration of a planning application for the development, in line with the forward horizon of the RTS. Should the development take place over a longer period than the horizon of the wider planning framework, a longer period of assessment will need to be agreed with the HA. The development proposal should be supported by an acceptable TA, carried out in accordance with the GTA, or on a basis otherwise agreed with the Agency. This timescale broadly reflects the Department for Transport's current funding regimes, particularly for major improvement schemes such as the Targeted Programme of Improvements (TPI). The length of this assessment period, at the discretion of the Secretary of State for Transport, can be amended for individual cases, where there is a wider political and economic imperative or, for example, where proposals will take a long time to develop fully. For further details please refer to DfT Circular 02/2007, _Planning and the Strategic Road Network_.

4.49 The appropriate horizon assessment year should be agreed with the relevant authorities during pre-application consultations.

4.50 The assessment years should consider person trips from all committed developments that would impact significantly on the transport network, particularly where they substantially overlap, such as at the same junctions and/or on roads as the proposed development. The committed developments will typically include development sites that have extant planning permission as well as development plan allocations in an adopted or approved plan. Developments that have been completed but not fully occupied should be included in these assessments. The inclusion or exclusion of committed developments in the assessments should be agreed with the relevant authorities at the pre-application stage.

4.51 The key issue is the need to ensure that development proposals strive to achieve nil detriment ('no worse off') to the strategic network, for the opening year and appropriate horizon year.

4.52 Government policy on new junctions on the SRN sets out a progressive response to proposals as a result of a development. Whilst new junctions may be acceptable on an all purpose trunk road, they will be unlikely to be acceptable on a motorway. Where a junction has been deemed acceptable, the assessment horizons for capacity and design life would be in accordance with DfT Circular 02/07 _Planning and the Strategic Road Network_ and the _Design Manual for Roads and Bridges_ (DMRB) respectively.7 For further details please refer to DfT Circular 02/2007, Planning and the Strategic Road Network.

### Analysis period

4.53 The analysis period should reflect the person trip generation characteristics of the proposed development, as well as conditions on the adjacent transport system. It should be related to known and anticipated peak patterns of demand both for the transport system and development-generated trips.

4.54 A TA should normally consider the following analysis periods:

  * weekday morning and evening peak period trips for the adjacent transport system, with particular focus on the peak period traffic flows on the road network; 
  * weekday morning and evening peak period trips for the proposed development; 
  * an off-peak period selected to assess level of greatest change resulting from the development; 
  * weekend peak period if the development is anticipated to generate significant levels of new trips at weekends or the adjacent transport system suffers from greater levels of congestion than during weekdays.

4.55 The analysis period should also include an assessment of the combination of development related and non-development-related trips. 

4.56 The analysis period should be agreed with the relevant authorities at the pre-application stage, including the HA where there is a potential impact on the SRN.

### Development trip generation

4.57 The first step in quantifying the impact of a proposed development on the transport system is to provide an estimate of the person trips (for all modes) that are likely to be generated by the development.

4.58 In preparing trip estimates, the travel characteristics of the proposed development should be established, and this should be based on a multi-modal assessment that identifies the number of person trips by mode and time period.

4.59 There is a range of trip rate database tools available that contain national, or in some cases more local, trip rates measured for typical land use sites. However, obtaining an accurate comparison is not always straightforward, especially for atypical developments. In these instances it is recommended that, unless there is a clear valid comparable situation, the assessment trips should be constructed from first principles based on a detailed analysis of the daily operation of the proposed development.

4.60 In all cases, analyses of development-related trips by using an appropriate database or an alternative methodology should be agreed with the relevant authorities, as this will form the major element of the TA.

4.61 Typically, trip generation assessments are based on the identification of suitable (person or vehicle) trip rates, having regard to industry standard databases such as TRICS, GENERATE and TRAVL.8 These trip rates should be derived on the basis of site-specific details of the proposed development - for example, proposed gross floor area, number of dwelling units, number of hotel rooms, availability and accessibility of non-car modes of travel, provision and nature of travel plans.

4.62 If sites with comparable accessibility9as well as scale and location cannot be found when using a standard database system, 85th percentile trip generation rates should be considered as a starting point for assessment of the baseline trip generation. The reasons for this are:

(i) since the level of public transport and non-car mode travel for sites within such trip databases is often unknown, a true like-for-like comparison is unlikely to be achieved; and

(ii) it is considered that the use of average trip rates with deductions for sustainability measures could result in overly optimistic trip rates for the proposed development.

4.63 In cases where the degree of comparability of source data sites to the development proposals is difficult to determine, it may be appropriate (in consultation with the appropriate highway authorities) to undertake a sensitivity analysis using both 85th percentile and average (50th percentile) trip rates to inform the process of the differences between these two assumptions.

### Calculating vehicular trip generation

4.64 As certain types of development, particularly retail, can have a significant effect on vehicular traffic, consideration may be given to the different types of vehicular trips that are likely to be generated, such as: 

  * **New trips** - these are trips that do not appear anywhere on the road network prior to the opening of the development. For many types of development, this element of generated trips can be relatively small; however, it is customary to consider all trips from residential developments as being new to the network. 
  * **Pass-by trips** - these are trips that are already present on the road network directly adjacent to the point(s) of access to the site, which will turn into the site. This type of trip is likely to be relevant only where the site is located on a major arterial route within an urban area. If it can be clearly demonstrated that there will be a proportion of true 'pass-by' trips that were already on the network, then these can be deducted from the calculated generation for the development. 
  * **Linked trips** - these are trips that will have multiple destinations either within the proposed development site. Examples include trips to food and non-food retail, between both the development site and existing adjacent sites or between the development site and an established town centre. Where there is a high probability that there will be a proportion of linked trips between two uses on a development, it is customary only to 'count' those trips once for the development as a whole, and not effectively double-count them by attributing two visits and departures affecting the sections of highway network being assessed. 
  * **Diverted trips** - these are trips that are already present on the local road network but not the road(s) from which site access is taken and will divert from their existing route to access the site. These are similar to pass-by trips, but they have to deviate to make use of the development under consideration. It is important to identify the potential for such diversion to occur so as to ensure that the correct flows are assessed at specific junctions on the highway network. Diverted trips will tend to return to their original route after visiting the development under consideration. 
  * **Transferred trips** - these are trips that are already present on the local road network, accessing similar existing sites in close proximity to the proposed development and will have the potential to transfer their destination to the proposed development. Slightly different from diverted trips, these wholly transfer from using an existing development to a new one, e.g. shoppers switching to a new supermarket that is more conveniently located for them.

4.65 The level of reduction in vehicular trip generation based on the mix of trips, as set out above, will be to a degree subjective and dependent on the specific characteristics and location of the proposed development. The methodology for deriving the development's vehicular trips and appropriate level of trip reduction, if any, should be agreed among the developer, the LHA and/or the HA during the pre-application consultations.

4.66 For large developments, the impact of construction traffic will require separate consideration. The assessment of construction traffic should identify the time period(s) during which construction activities will take place, the numbers of trips likely to be generated, the vehicle type and, for heavy construction traffic, an appropriate diversion route or a traffic management plan to minimise local impacts.

### Adjustment of development vehicular trips

4.67 In some circumstances, the extent of access by non-car modes of transport may suggest an adjustment of development-generated vehicle trips. This is likely to be the case where new sustainable transport infrastructure, such as cycleway or bus services, is proposed by the developer. It may also be appropriate when a proposed development is located where there is a particularly high-quality and accessible existing public transport system.

4.68 The work undertaken to analyse public transport network capacity will be important at this stage, to ensure that assumptions are not erroneously made regarding the ability of existing services to cope with development trips. At this stage the TA should identify whether the intended level of public transport trips from the development can be met by existing services, or whether the development mitigation package should enhance the level of service.

4.69 Where a development proposal includes significant improvements to non-car infrastructure, it is more likely that the LTA/LHA will accept reductions in car-related trip estimates.

4.70 The element of development trips that is likely to be the least sustainable is single occupancy private car. Hence it would be beneficial to place significant emphasis on reduction of this category of trips throughout development proposals and the TA preparation.

4.71 It is important that the appropriate level of reduction, if any, should be agreed among the developer, the LHA and/or the HA preferably at the pre-application consultation stage.

### Trip distribution and assignment

4.72 Prior to the distribution and assignment of development-related person trips, it is important to establish a development catchment area and identify the main population zones within it. This catchment area should be discussed and agreed with the relevant authorities from the outset. It is important to note that proximity to the highway network and, in particular, the SRN or other higher standard routes may have a significant impact on the extent of the catchment area to be considered.

4.73 It is recommended that the distribution of development-related person trips be based on an appropriate methodology. These include, but are not limited to, the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based census data analysis, a gravity model,10 existing traffic flow patterns, area-wide traffic models (if available) and, by analogy, travel patterns for similar developments in the vicinity of the site.

4.74 For some large retail developments, it is commonplace to undertake a series of key assessments in the context of _Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for Town Centres_ (PPS) 16 which will have analyses of customer catchment area and home locations. Where these are available, the findings of such assessments should be used to validate the trip distribution assumptions.

4.75 The agreed trip distribution should then be used to assign development trips to the transport network, taking due account of the impact of the various trip types, as noted earlier.

### Environmental impact issues

4.76 As discussed earlier in sections 4.26-4.44, the environmental impacts of any significant development need to be addressed. This might be covered by a separate Environmental Statement (ES), which involves an assessment of a development's potential environmental implications, including those that are transport-related. This will help ensure that the significance of the predicted impacts and the scope for mitigating them are properly addressed at the outset.

4.77 As part of the scoping exercise for the ES, it may be decided that an assessment of air quality and noise impact is required. Such an assessment should identify, in particular, traffic data such as peak hour traffic flows, 18-hour traffic flows, Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) flows, percentage of HGVs, traffic speeds for the surrounding highway network and daily traffic generation forecasts for the development proposal. Where appropriate, daily traffic generations of the extant or historic site use may also be required.

4.78 The LHA and/or the HA would require assessment of the environmental impact from any increase of traffic on the highway network where statutory limits might be breached. The same is true if any highway mitigation measures were to be proposed as a result of the development. Further details on environmental assessments can be found in Circular 02/99 published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) in 1999 and available from the Communities and Local Government website.

### Promoting smarter choices via travel plans

4.79 Smarter Choices are techniques for influencing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable options, such as encouraging school, workplace and individualised travel planning. They also include measures such as individualised marketing, personalised journey plans, public transport information and marketing initiatives, car sharing schemes and car clubs, plus measures that reduce the need to travel, such as video conferencing and teleworking.

4.80 A travel plan (TP) is a package of site-specific initiatives aimed at improving the availability and choice of travel modes to and from a development. It may also promote practices or policies that reduce the need for travel. TPs are becoming an increasingly important tool in the delivery of sustainable outcomes. They provide, together with transport assessments, the mechanism for assessing and managing access to sites. In addition, they can help improve accessibility, both to and from the site, and to local amenities and services.

4.81 PPG13 states the Government considers that a travel plan should be submitted alongside planning applications that are likely to have significant transport implications. Local authorities can help facilitate the development of effective travel plans by ensuring that measures in support of them are incorporated in local planning policies, including the LDF and LTP, and clarified through supplementary planning advice. A requirement for a TP should be established at the pre-application stage. The TP should be tailored to address the site-specific issues relating to the proposed development.

4.82 During the pre-application consultations the use of an area travel plan and co-ordination with travel plans from adjacent developments should also be considered. The use of area and site-specific travel plans is an important mechanism in the underlying aim to manage vehicle trips at source. Whenever a site-specific TP is proposed, the developer should ascertain the existence of an area-wide TP. Where one exists, the site-specific TP should integrate with the area-wide TP.

4.83 Detailed guidance on securing travel plans through the planning system is available on the DfT's web site. TfL has also produced more detailed guidance for the London area, available at [www.tfl.gov.uk](http://www.tfl.gov.uk). 

4.84 Detailed guidance on other Smarter Choices techniques, and the promotion of sustainable transport modes more generally, is provided in the section of the DfT web site.

### Transport impacts and mitigation measures

4.85 Government transport policy is, wherever possible, to seek alternative solutions to building new roads, by reducing the impact of road users on each other and the environment, improving road performance through improved network management and facilitating smarter journey choices. The presumption should be to give preference where possible to solutions other than the construction of new roads.

4.86 The information provided at the pre-application stage and in the TA should be reviewed by the LHA and/or the HA, as appropriate, with the aim of determining the type and scope of mitigation measures to be provided. This process will be undertaken in conjunction with the LPA.

4.87 In doing so, they should have regard to the Traffic Management Act 2004, which places a network management duty on local traffic authorities in England. Planning authorities in two-tier areas and developers could usefully liaise with local traffic authorities where their development or works affect the movement of traffic on the road network. Traffic authorities should work closely with such planning authorities, as well as developers, utility companies and others, so that they are aware of the duty. In this way joint consideration may be given to the impacts that both developments and their associated works may have on the movement of traffic.

4.88 The TA, along with other supporting documents, will form the basis for the LPA's, LTA's, LHA's and/or HA's response to a proposed development and, in particular, the type or level of mitigation that will be required. Typically, mitigation could be required where the proposed development is likely to impact adversely upon the transport system and/or result in breaches of statutory environmental limits.

4.89 Where mitigation is proposed, following agreement on the scope of mitigation to be provided, the relevant authorities will require or recommend that appropriate conditions be attached to any planning permission granted. The conditions or obligations should specify the improvements that will be required to accommodate the proposed development's trips by all modes. They should also ensure the safety of all road users, including non-motorised users or vulnerable users. Conditions or obligations may require that necessary mitigation measures be completed before first occupation of units on the site, or before work on the development site itself commences if construction traffic is a major issue.

4.90 In all cases, the transport mitigation plan or package of measures should focus on maximising sustainable accessibility to the development. At the outset, the mitigation plan should consider measures such as: improvements to development site layout to facilitate walking and cycling as well as accessibility to the local public transport infrastructure; improvements to walking and cycling provisions in the vicinity of the development site; and improvements to the local public transport network.

4.91 The scope and implementation strategy for the improvements suggested above should be agreed with the relevant authorities. 

4.92 If the TA confirms that a development will have material impact on the highway network, the level of impact at all critical locations on the network should be established. A particular example of material impact would be a worsening of congestion. In congested areas, the percentage traffic impact that is considered significant or detrimental to the network may be relatively low (possibly below the average daily variation in flow), and should have been determined in discussions with the relevant highway authorities. For the avoidance of doubt, the 1994 guidance regarding the assessment thresholds of 10 per cent and 5 per cent levels of development traffic relative to background traffic is no longer deemed an acceptable mechanism, since it creates an incentive in favour of locating development where high levels of background traffic already exist.

4.93 If the mitigation measures require physical improvements to the highway network, the developer should ensure that, in any design of mitigation works, appropriate design guides and parameters are used. Road Safety Audits may be required for any development-related highway works and, when produced, should be conducted in compliance with the relevant standards.

4.94 In respect of the SRN, proposed mitigation measures should provide capacity that is comparable to the general capacity of that part of the network and not, for example, seek to produce a junction with significantly more capacity than the surrounding SRN. 

7  The latest DMRB guidance is available at www.highways.gov.uk

8  These are examples of trip-rate database systems which are used in England to predict trip rates for proposed land uses

9  Sites with similar levels of public transport, cycling and pedestrian accessibility should be found before a sufficiently comparable trip-rate prediction can be made from the industry available database systems.

10  A Gravity model is a simple assessment technique that uses population within geographic zones as a proportion of the total population within a catchment area to give a likely proportion of trips arriving at and departing from a development site by highway route.

## Chapter 5: The link with the development plan making process

5.1 National planning policy as set out in PPS1, PPS11 and PPS12 emphasises the requirement for development plans to be founded on 'a robust and credible evidence base'.11

5.2 Development plans will only be credible, authoritative and deliverable if transport considerations are fully factored into their development from the outset. 

5.3 Within this context it is clearly important that the transport impacts of alternative spatial development patterns are properly assessed at an early stage and throughout the planmaking process as an integral part of the sustainability appraisal of emerging plans. Appropriate policy responses must be developed to reduce the need to travel and promote sustainable transport choices.

5.4 The assessment methodologies and assumptions applied in assessing the transport implications of a major development at the planning application stage can also be employed in testing development plan options, although the level of detail underpinning the analysis may be lower, particularly at a regional level.

5.5 It will be beneficial for the planning body/authority to ensure full engagement of all stakeholders throughout the development plan process.

### Regional and local planning framework

5.6 PPS11 Regional Spatial Strategies and PPS12 Local Development Frameworks set out policy advice on how integration between transport and spatial planning can be achieved at regional and local levels respectively. Guidance on undertaking sustainability appraisal is set out in _Sustainability Appraisal of Regional Spatial Strategies and Local Development Documents_.

5.7 RPBs may wish to consider the commissioning and development of region-wide transport models to evaluate the transport impacts of alternative spatial development patterns and regionally significant developments. As part of the process it is beneficial to test for what is sustainable and deliverable.

5.8 LPAs may seek to use existing regional, sub-regional, or local transport models where available and/or to undertake their own separate assessments of the transport impacts of alternative strategies in emerging core strategy DPDs. They may also seek to do this for any alternative sites that are proposed in site allocation documents or action area plans. 

5.9 There is a wide variety of modelling and forecasting tools available to authorities, and there is no requirement to follow any particular process. Whilst it is recognised that the development and use of transport models can require significant resources, the benefits cannot be underestimated. It will be for authorities to decide whether transport modelling is most appropriate and useful in their area and, if so, at what level, having regard to the requirement for a robust and credible evidence base.

5.10 In assessing the transport impacts of alternative spatial scenarios it is important to make full use of existing information that is relevant. Many transport and land-use models and/or studies carried out by the HA and PTAs, as well as any other studies, may represent a substantial source of information. This includes transport assessments undertaken for recent development in the area. LTPs may also provide a valuable resource for local transport analysis.

5.11 It may be beneficial for RPBs, LPAs and other stakeholders to work jointly to develop regional and local models in order to undertake these assessments.

5.12 At both levels, but more particularly at the LDF stage where more detail is available, it is important that the cumulative effects of multiple potential developments should be assessed, so as to ensure that interaction effects of different combinations of sites on the highway network are fully understood.

5.13 This approach would also assist the early identification of potential environmental difficulties on the highway network, which can then be considered in greater detail through the development plan process.

5.14 The NATA may provide a useful framework for assessing the overall transport impact of a major development. The NATA recommends the assessment of a wide range of environmental, social and economic impacts to enable sustainable decisions to be made. The NATA also gives advice on how more detailed assessments can be summarised in a consistent way, so that different options can be easily compared with one another in a consistent manner.

5.15 When assessing the development of individual sites (as proposed in the relevant allocations/action area documents), trip generation estimates should, where possible, be derived using similar methodologies and assumptions as are applied in the planning application stage. The fundamental issue is the need to establish the amount of trips and/or residual traffic that would be generated by the development proposals.

5.16 Models or reports should provide an indication of the operational capabilities and deficiencies of the transport system, particularly on the highway network, and help establish a benchmark or baseline for assessing the potential impacts of development aspirations on the transport system.

5.17 Transport models or network reports should be regularly updated to reflect programmed improvements to the transport system, as well as the emergence of development aspirations and proposals in neighbouring areas. This will allow for the assessment of cross-boundary impacts.

### Strategic road network

5.18 The HA will work with developers to secure delivery of their proposals in such a way that they minimise any additional burden on other users of the strategic road network. Development should normally be in line with policies and proposals already set out in the development plan. Where development proposals are fully consistent with the adopted development plan, the HA would not expect to have to engage in the full assessment process, provided there had been no material changes after LDD adoption. In such circumstances, consideration would normally be limited to the agreement of detailed access arrangements (including mitigation measures) rather than the principle of the development itself.

This paper presents the results of analysis of the CCT Evaluation Baseline Survey results by independent expert Nick Cavill in collaboration with DfT social researchers.

The analysis investigates the potential for delivering public health benefits through increasing cycling amongst different population groups. It then explores the size and characteristics of those groups to inform the targeting of cycling interventions.

The results are relevant to local authorities who are making the case for investment in cycling, and considering how best to design schemes to realise the health benefits of cycling.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/high-speed-rail-addendum,High speed rail: investing in Britain’s future consultation summary report addendum,Addendum report providing a summary of 413 responses mistakenly excluded from the initial analysis.,"## Summary

On 10 January 2012 the government announced its decision to develop a new national high speed rail network following the completion of a major public consultation. On 29 May, the consultation responses were published online. We then discovered that a small number of responses (407 out of 55,322 responses) had unintentionally not been forwarded to Dialogue by Design for inclusion in their response assessment process. In addition, a further 6 responses had been incorrectly marked as duplicates by Dialogue by Design.

This addendum report is a supplementary analysis of all the affected consultation responses which was commissioned from Dialogue by Design. The report concludes that these 413 responses do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report"". Therefore, their inclusion in Dialogue by Design's original review of responses would not have substantially changed its findings nor affected the considerations which informed the decisions following consultation.

The Secretary of State for Transport issued a statement to Parliament about this on 17 July 2012 and we have contacted all those who submitted a response affected by the processing error. The consultation summary report and the addendum report each include a list of participating organisations at appendix 2 and appendix 1 respectively. Individual respondents are not listed.

## Transcript

**Narrator:** The South East Seven, otherwise known as SE7, is a good example of councils building a partnership to deliver better, more efficient services, including highways maintenance. David Hodge, leader of Surrey County Council, explains.

**David Hodge:** SE7 was born out of a political drive to see how we could work better collectively and corporately across Surrey, East and West Sussex, Hampshire, Kent, Medway and Brighton and Hove. The idea was how could we actually deliver better quality services with actual better benefits to the residents of our areas.

**Narrator:** Andrew Smith, Chief Executive of Hampshire County Council, was quick to recognise that highway authorities needed to achieve greater efficiencies and welcomed the SE7 initiative and the ethos of HMEP. I think the benefits come from when you kind of shape the market so you get more bang for your bucks, you get more efficient and you get more opportunity to drive down costs. I think you get that benefit more readily if you're in collaboration you get the benefits of standardisation, consistency and the benefits of outcomes with less professional resource. SE7 is an example, still in its infancy, where we believe coming together with seven other authorities will give us the opportunities to get these sorts of benefits.

**Narrator:** There are already good examples of collaborative working in the highways sector, But for some, collaboration represents a significant cultural change and Andrew Smith, argues that change has to be top down.

**Andrew Smith:** I think It's a change programme and we know that sometimes we have to work very hard to embed effective change in an organisation. I think that it comes from both political and managerial leadership. I think it's a challenge for us to provide that leadership and similarly our colleagues in environment, roads and transportation to demonstrate they're fit and ready for this particular task. The benefits of embedding a programme is to rate the safety and value of a national asset such as the road network- people want to be safe on that network, they don't want the disruption and they also want the economic benefits of making sure people can get around the county as they do in other parts of the country.

**Narrator:** David Hodge, is already seeing local officers buy into the concept.

**David Hodge:** What we're trying to do is set out quite clear benchmarking with quality control encompassed within the structure as we go forward to ensure, so we can collectively ensure, we get the best value and ensure that no council is paying unnecessarily for a service from a contractor. We know that in some areas some authorities are paying 80% more than other authorities for different types of areas. In one case we know one authority is paying double the rate that say Surrey does for let's say emptying our gullies. This is the sort of thing that's critical that we as the politicians must drive through and make sure we have proper value for money and we are not paying the wrong rates. It's critical, but it cannot be done without the officer support and that is really - that has really been good about the whole process, is the support we've had from the chief execs downwards through the various heads of services and senior officers working on the projects, they've made a huge difference. It's actually really good to see them in the same room. Suddenly it's not just an officer from Surrey, but it's an officer helping, what can he/she do for the whole of SE7, that's really important.

## Transcript

**Narrator:** The Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme came out of the last spending review, one of the toughest for many years. Andrew Smith, Chief Executive of Hampshire County Council, explains why the programme was set up.

**Andrew Smith:** I think we all know the problems of public finances at the moment, we all know about getting more efficient in what we do is important. I think part of that efficiency is collaborating with other local authorities. That requires local government to come together to do that and I think that collaboration has to be with the DfT as well as it controls a great deal of the resource we need to work in partnership with central and local government.

**Narrator:** An influential voice for contractors is the Highways Term Maintenance Association, or HTMA. Its chair, Philip Hoare, outlines why contractors have also welcomed the inception of HMEP.

**Philip Hoare:** We recognised very early on that the best thing for us to do as an organisation was to look at the HMEP programme and see how we could support that. At the moment the challenges facing us is all about trying to maximise the amount of money that goes into front line services and the best way of doing that I think is for public and private sectors to really throw everything up on the air and really say 'let's look at how we deliver services and importantly look at how these services are delivered together to maximise the efficiency.

There are a number of examples out there already of really excellent relationships that have been developed. For example, there's Buckinghamshire County Council which has worked very well with Noy Jacobs to develop an incredibly tight knit partnership using a theme client model, which again, is starting to deliver efficiencies in the sector. There's Gloucestershire for example, one very close to my heart, which I ran myself which has been in place for about 5 years, which is a very integrated public/private partnership where half the staff are Atkins employees and half are Gloucestershire CC employees. 

**Andrew Smith:** I think we'll agree that where an idea is a good enough one you should look at it seriously. We've been looking at procurement efficiencies, cost reductions and transformation programmes. I think this programme sits fairly amongst those and know we spend £30 - 40 million a year of council money on the network and if we look at that over the life of the council, it's in excess of £100 million in each administration. I think there's a realisation with our private sector partners that we have to get smarter, we have to get more for less.

**Narrator:** But as Philip Hoare is keen to highlight, there are many challenges facing the programme.

**Philip Hoare:** The fact is that the way that the highways maintenance works in the UK and England in particular, there are a variety of 150 or so different highway authorities all doing things in different ways. Some of them deliver services in-house, some of them work very closely with the private sector already. So at one extreme you could say there are 150 different answers for each of the different authorities or you could say there's one - when actually it's somewhere between. And what we need to do as part of the programme is develop a range of solutions that allows authorities to still have that independence to select what is more appropriate to them but to actually minimise that and try to standardise and introduce some consistency because this variety and lots of different authorities using different contract forms, different sets of specifications for work, this variety introduces inefficiency.

**Narrator:** But in spite of being supportive of a new reality in highway maintenance, surely contractors will only be driven by bottom line results and maximise profit at every opportunity.

**Philip Hoare:** Clearly we are private sector companies, all of us engaged in the HTMA, and we need to make a profit, that's why we exist. However, what we recognise is that there is so much to go at in terms of driving efficiency in this sector, we want this sector to be a buoyant one for both the private and public companies involved in delivering these services and we recognise the only real way of doing that is to look at how we can work together. As individuals and leaders in our business in the HTMA, we're absolutely driven by that and I know that my counterparts in the member organisations of the HTMA are absolutely focussed on how we can use this programme to drive efficiency, drive some real innovations etc and actually make it an exciting and dynamic place for ourselves and our member companies to operate in.

## Transcript

**Narrator:** One of the biggest concerns highway authorities have about working collaboratively to introduce far greater efficiencies in highways maintenance is the potential loss of sovereignty as Andrew Smith, Chief Executive of Hampshire County Council explains.

**Andrew Smith:** For the last four or five years I worked on construction and capital projects for CLG and realised that local authorities find it difficult to give up sovereignty. 

**Philip Hoare:** One of the challenges of the whole programme is that there is a 'not invented here' type syndrome with a number of authorities and a number of client groups. We need to knock down some of those barriers because what we're after is the most efficient way delivering a service.

**David Hodge:** Sometimes with large schemes like this, people assume you need to create a huge administration burden but what we've actually done is by working together on different levels and in different areas of work we're able to retain sovereignty within the control of SE7. In other words, the decisions we will make in Surrey will be decisions that the administration of Surrey does, likewise in Kent and in Sussex and Hampshire. When they make a decision collectively, they know that's the decision that suits the residents and their budget aspirations.

**Andrew Smith:** You still end up making a local decision, but you make it in a framework where you achieve something more for less. Most politicians and most political leaders in my experience will certainly trade a bit of sovereignty for greater efficiencies, but the trick is to make sure the local decisions with politicians that are accountable and that organisations are accountable if that's left in place. And I think that's the key to successful collaboration. If you go to market with a billion pound contract you'll get a very different response to that than if you go to market with a £200 million contract.

**David Hodge:** The current crisis local government is in is actually starting to make people realise that we cannot operate as silos, we cannot operate as individual councils. We must actually talk with our neighbours, talk with our colleagues, how can we do things differently?

It really was an eye opener on how other councils were prepared to come to the table, shed their sovereign issues and say 'let's work together, let's do what we can and actually make sure what we can for the benefit of residents'.

**Philip Hoare:** When we first heard about the HMEP programme, one of the first things we did was to compile a list of all the sort of areas where we felt there were examples of best practice working in local authorities or indeed, just specific things around efficiencies - from pothole repairs to the way back office services are delivered - but basically, to look at different examples of efficiency and provide those to the team putting HMEP together. The great thing is being able to capture those areas of best practice, look at what's working really well, avoiding reinventing the wheel, because the last thing we want to introduce are additional costs.

On the currently anticipated programme, construction will start around 2016 and the line will be operational from 2026. Later this year we will be commencing a comprehensive land referencing exercise to identify and confirm all property interests affected by the route.

The properties that are very close to the line of the route, and therefore may need to be acquired for the scheme would not be needed before 2015 at the earliest, but individuals may be able to bring this forward should they so wish.

In due course property owners will be contacted by representatives of HS2 Ltd, the company established to deliver the project. This would be to discuss the particular circumstances concerning their property and the process and arrangements that may apply regarding the potential future acquisition of all (or part) of their property, a process known as ""compulsory purchase"".

There is already in place a statutory code for compulsory purchase of property required for major public infrastructure schemes. This sets out rights to compensation and other arrangements and there are a set of booklets published by the Department for Communities and Local government (CLG), which provide clear advice on this complex area.

  * [Compulsory purchase and compensation booklet 1: Compulsory purchase procedure](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/compulsorypurchase)

Alternatively, you can call the CLG publications line on 0300 123 1124 between 8am and 8pm between Monday to Friday and ask to be mailed a free copy of the compulsory purchase booklets.

In addition to the statutory compensation code, the Secretary of State has asked that proposals for discretionary measures be brought forward, aimed at mitigating as far as is reasonably possible, the effect of the project on property markets, and on peoples' lives. We will make further announcements about these proposals as soon as possible, but can confirm that they will include:

  * a sale and rent back scheme for properties required for compulsory purchase, which would give people more choice as to when they left their property
  * the advance payment of a compensation claim, for example, to aid relocation

Further information on these proposals can be found in the Review of Property Issues document that was published alongside the announcement of the decision. Hard copies can be obtained by calling DfT Publications on 0300 123 1334.

  * [Review of property issues](/publications/hs2-review-of-property-issues/)

HS2 Ltd will proceed swiftly to recruit staff and to appoint agents that can act on its behalf at a local level.

It is expected that these individuals will have started work by the summer of 2012 and that they will contact you in due course.

If in the meantime, if you have issues or concerns that you need to discuss immediately, then please contact the HS2 Ltd Enquiries Line on 020 7944 4908.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-consultation-summary,High speed rail: investing in Britain's future consultation summary report,An independent report providing a summary of the responses to the government's consultation 'High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future'.,"## Executive summary

This report provides a summary of the responses to the government's consultation on 'High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future'.

The government believes investing in a national high speed rail network is the best value for money solution for enhancing rail capacity and performance in the United Kingdom. It launched a consultation on the proposed high speed rail strategy and its proposed route for an initial high speed line from London to the West Midlands. The consultation ran for five months, closing on 29 July 2011.

The government received 54,909 responses to this consultation. About 40% of the responses were submitted through the consultation website; the remaining 60% included paper response forms, individual letters and emails, detailed reports and organised responses. Close to 15,000 responses were identified as part of organised submissions. A response is considered part of an organised submission if its content is identical or nearly identical to numerous other responses, eg consisting of a pre-printed response postcard to which respondents add their details.

Members of the public submitted the great majority of responses. Organisations which responded included statutory agencies, local authorities, businesses and various representative groups. Responses came from regions across the UK, with concentrations in postcode areas in proximity to the proposed route from London to the West Midlands.

## Introduction

On 28 February 2011 the government launched a national consultation, 'High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future'. The consultation set out the government's proposed strategy for a national high speed rail network for Britain and the route for an initial line between London and the West Midlands.

The consultation asked seven questions, covering the government's overall strategy, the proposed route for the London to West Midlands line, the environmental appraisal of this line, and options for supporting property owners affected by the proposals. The consultation closed on 29 July 2011. 54,909 responses were received.

The purpose of this document is to set out the decisions reached by the government in the light of the consultation on these issues. It also outlines the programme for the immediate next stages of the project, including consultation on property and blight proposals and the development of the hybrid Bill for the London-West Midlands line.

  * Part I of this document sets out the government's confirmed strategy for high speed rail
  * Part II discusses the key issues raised in consultation responses
  * Part III presents the next steps that the government will pursue on the project

It describes changes to forecasts of demand and the updated economic appraisal of HS2.,"## Executive summary

This document provides an update to the 'Economic case for HS2: The Y network and London-West Midlands', published in February 2011 (the ""February 2011 economic case""). It forms part of HS2 Ltd's advice to government, and presents changes to forecasts of demand and the updated economic appraisal of HS2.

The purpose of this document is to revise the February 2011 economic case modelling and appraisal to reflect changes to:

  * **economic forecasts** - we have updated our demand forecasts in light of revised economic forecasts
  * **patterns of demand** - we have updated our modelling to incorporate recent changes in the demand for long distance travel
  * **Y network development** - we have reviewed costs for the Y network, and separately costs for London to West Midlands, on the basis of further development of Y network station and route options
  * **forecast rail services without HS2** - we have updated assumptions on the rail services expected in the absence of HS2, as a result of increased information and the commitment by government to additional rail enhancement schemes

This update details the resulting implications for the appraisal of the costs and benefits of HS2. It follows the structure of the February 2011 report in presenting the overall economic case for HS2. As with the February 2011 report, we continue to assume that all costs are borne by the public sector and that there are no premium fares or sophisticated yield management on high speed rail.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-economic-case-value-for-money,Economic case for HS2: value for money statement,The Department for Transport's assessment of the value for money of HS2.,"## Summary

Part one of this report sets out the government's view on the value for money of HS2 Ltd's proposed high speed rail network. It should be read in conjunction with the report Economic case for HS2: Updated appraisal of transport user benefits and wider economic benefits for London to West Midlands and the Y Network. The value for money assessment also considers the suitability and robustness of the approach to appraisal used by HS2 Ltd.

The value for money process summarised in this section forms an important part of the transport business case. The methodology used by the Department in setting out business cases ensures decisions are made which take account of all the relevant information, and follows an approach consistent with HM Treasury Green Book guidance. The value for money assessment constitutes the economic case for HS2 and considers whether all of the collective impacts delivered by the scheme represent good value for taxpayers' money. Although there are some overlaps, detailed information regarding the strategic, commercial, financial and management cases is not provided in this document.

Part two of this report reviews the criticisms raised in responses to the High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future consultation document relating to technical elements of the economic case for HS2. Views and evidence provided to the government in written responses to the consultation were considered in producing this report. It provides analysis to support the Secretary of State for Transport's decisions as set out in High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future - decisions and next steps.

The government has decided to develop a new national high speed rail network, the most significant transport infrastructure project in the UK since the building of the motorways. Following in the tracks of the Victorian railway pioneers and the post war planners who developed the motorway network, the government is signalling its commitment to providing 21st century infrastructure and connections - laying the groundwork for long term, sustainable economic growth.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-review-of-appraisal-of-sustainability,Review of HS2 London to West Midlands appraisal of sustainability,"A review by HS2 Ltd of high speed rail consultation responses regarding the appraisal of sustainability. It includes consideration of comments on the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, and species and habitats.","## Executive summary

This is HS2 Ltd's advice to government on the outcomes of the review of responses to the consultation regarding the Appraisal of Sustainability (AoS) for HS2 London to West Midlands. The 'High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future' consultation was launched on 28th February 2011 with a closing date for responses of 29th July 2011. That consultation covered both the government's strategy for high speed rail, and the line of route for phase one from London to the West Midlands.

This report considers:

  * general comments about the approach to environment and sustainability
  * energy, greenhouse gas emissions, combating climate change and issues of modal shift in relation to the consultation route
  * air quality
  * natural and cultural resources: protection and enhancement of the environment in relation to the consultation route
  * specific impacts to species and habitats
  * community related route impacts
  * jobs and regeneration
  * monitoring

If a decision is taken to proceed with HS2 London to West Midlands we would undertake a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) necessary to accompany the hybrid bill required to authorise the proposals.

The EIA would follow the requirements of the Parliamentary Standing Orders including the development of a scope and methodology for the assessment, the determination of significant environmental effects to be brought before the decision makers through the Parliamentary process and identification of relevant mitigation measures. This would be presented as the project's Environmental Statement (ES). The process of developing the EIA and mitigation would include a plan of engagement and consultation with local people and relevant authorities. A Statement of Public Participation (SPP) would form part of the ES considered through Parliamentary scrutiny.

We have carefully considered the views expressed including criticisms of the AoS in consultation responses. In a number of cases these have identified areas that would require further investigation and the development of mitigation as part of the EIA mentioned above. In a number of locations, in response to issues raised during consultation, we have recommended changes to the line of route to mitigate environmental impacts. These are set out in the Review of possible refinements to the proposed HS2 London to West Midlands Route report.

Consultation responses did not identify an alternative approach that we would consider to be appropriate for the project. Having analysed consultation responses we are confident that the approach we took to examining the impacts on the environment and sustainability through the AoS is an appropriate one for the stage of development of the proposals. We consider our appraisal represents a sound basis on which the Secretary of State can make a decision.

This is HS2 Ltd's report to government on the outcomes of our studies into, and recommendations for, potential line of route alignment changes to HS2 London to West Midlands in response to issues raised during consultation. We used these to develop a programme of local studies to consider options for mitigating impacts and enhancing the line of route. The 'High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future consultation' was launched on 28th February 2011 with a closing date for responses of 29th July 2011. That consultation covered both the government's strategy for high speed rail, and the proposed line of route for phase one from London to West Midlands.

Balancing engineering issues, environmental issues, costs and benefits we recommend that, if a decision is taken to proceed with HS2, the following changes be considered for inclusion in the line of route to be taken forward to preliminary design and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):

  * increase the clearance of HS2 over the Trent and Mersey Canal near Lichfield to ensure that it remains navigable. We also recommend a slight alteration to the alignment to ensure that it would be compatible with a future extended high speed network
  * move the route slightly further away from Middleton to reduce local impacts
  * a shallower cutting and longer green tunnel at Burton Green to further mitigate local impacts and reduce spoil generation
  * mitigation of impacts on Balsall Common
  * move the route slightly further east to avoid Kenilworth Golf Club, lower it further into cutting through the National Agricultural Centre, and introduce a retained cutting through South Cubbington Wood to reduce impacts on this ancient woodland
  * introduce a longer bored tunnel at Long Itchington Wood
  * introduce a longer green tunnel past Chipping Warden and Aston le Walls, and to curve the route to avoid a cluster of important heritage sites at Edgcote
  * lower the alignment and introduce a green tunnel past Greatworth, and a short green tunnel at Turweston
  * move the route further away from Twyford
  * lower the alignment past Aylesbury and Stoke Mandeville to reduce local impacts and eliminate the need for larger scale works to local roads and the Chiltern Line
  * introduce a longer green tunnel to reduce impacts around Wendover, and an extension to the green tunnel at South Heath
  * introduce a longer, continuous tunnel from Little Missenden to the M25 through the Chilterns AONB to reduce the need for deep cutting and to avoid an aquifer
  * introduce a 2.75 mile (4.4 km) bored tunnel along the Northolt corridor to reduce impacts on local communities and avoid major works to the Chiltern Line

Taken together we consider that these changes would be a considerable enhancement to the consultation route. The number of properties that would be at risk of land take, either during or after construction, would be reduced. Noise impacts would be substantially lower. It would result in a small reduction in the number of properties that would be demolished, and a much larger reduction in the number that would be at risk of land take. There would be reduced impacts on communities and the landscape of the Chilterns AONB due to an increased length of tunnelling and green tunnels, while the adoption of additional green tunnels elsewhere along the route would reduce impacts on the landscape, biodiversity and local communities. Through the Chilterns AONB this would mean that seven and a half miles would be in tunnel or green tunnel. More than three and a half miles would be hidden in deep cutting, reducing visual impacts, meaning less than two miles would be visible.

These improvements can be achieved without impacting on journey times and with an overall reduction in construction costs compared to the consultation route.

Although the studies have identified an opportunity to improve the route in a number of places at this stage, this would not be the final opportunity to refine or mitigate the route. That would finally be decided through ongoing engagement as part of the EIA and through the hybrid bill process in Parliament. If a decision is taken to proceed with HS2 along this route we would use consultation responses to support preliminary design and inform the development of mitigation measures along the length of the route.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-review-of-property-issues,Review of property issues,A review by the Department for Transport of the property concerns raised during the consultation on high speed rail and the government's policies to minimise blight and support communities.,"## Introduction

We recognise that home-owners along the line have already been affected by the proposal to build HS2.

HS2 will have a significant positive impact on the UK transport network and economy.

We recognise that it will also affect home-owners, communities and businesses along the line.

We have taken a number of important decisions to limit these negative impacts. These include moving the line away from towns and villages, lowering it further into cutting, and increasing the length in tunnels.

Past experience of infrastructure projects and other kinds of development suggest that blight tends to be at its worst before building starts. The uncertainty about what might happen creates fear and helps spread rumours that often have little basis. The reality of the impact, when it arrives, consistently turns out to be less disruptive than feared. Blight is at its highest when there is most uncertainty and least definite information.

We have already worked to minimise that uncertainty and blight by consulting on a preferred line of route and by organizing a comprehensive consultation.

The responses we received to the property question in the February 2011 consultation, 'High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future' has strengthened the evidence base on which we have built policy proposals.

Annex A of the document accompanying that consultation described the existing statutory mechanisms in place for providing assistance to property owners affected by construction projects such as a new high speed rail line.

It also discussed the approach and options for additional assistance the government was considering providing to the owners of properties which experienced a significant diminution in value as a result of proximity to any new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.

It stated an ambition to work towards a property deal that would:

  * Assist those whose properties lose significant value
  * Enable the normal functioning of the property market
  * Reassure now that fair compensation will be paid
  * Enable people to stay in their homes and communities
  * Avoid government owning large numbers of properties

One of the clearest messages to come through (both from the written consultation responses and from statements made and questions asked by the individuals who came to the road-shows) is a widespread fear that the government will not do enough to prevent blight and protect property values and communities.

Many homeowners expressed real concern that the disruption caused by construction would lower property values and make their communities less attractive places to live.

Others were concerned that their properties would be affected by vibration and subsidence because of HS2 tunnels.

Of the around 55,000 people who responded to the consultation 36,036, or over 65%, included comments on the potential impact of HS2 on property.

The vast majority of these comments were made by members of the public rather than organisations, and the concerns raised were often personal and interwoven with those individuals' hopes and fears about their future.

A fear of increased noise is a common thread running through many of the consultation responses. In total, 11,843 respondents mentioned noise and many stated their concern that an increase in noise might cause irreversible damage to their quality of life and to the communities they live in.

Responses also highlighted the potential impact on farming. We will work with those affected on a case by case basis.

During the February consultation we set out three broad policy proposals: a hardship-based property purchase scheme, a bond-based purchase scheme and a compensation bond.

Many respondents complained that the consultation did not provide enough detail about these proposals for them to be able to respond usefully.

It is understandable that when asked to discuss something as important and as personal as their own homes and communities many individuals felt that they deserved as much detail and as much reassurance as possible.

At the same time, we believe that comments like these reflect a genuine difficulty in striking a balance between providing enough detail to make the consultation meaningful and reaching policy conclusions before having consulted properly.

Others stated that no amount of compensation could ever be acceptable. For some, this was because of their strong opposition to HS2 in general. For others, the perceived risk of damage to communities and the environment was simply too great to be tolerated.

16,027 respondents stated (in response to Question 7 on blight and compensation) that they did not agree with the options set out to assist those whose properties lose a significant amount of value as a result of any new high speed line.

2,667 said that they did agree without referring specifically to the options, and 530 agreed generally with some caveats.

Some of those who support the approach set out by the government argued that this is a fair and even generous approach to compensation. Others focused more on the argument that some level of blight has to be tolerated if the UK's infrastructure is to be improved.

Only 4,474 responses explicitly mention any of the three options. Of these 4,402 backed the bond-based purchase scheme, whether outright or with caveats. The Council of Mortgage Lenders and the British Bankers' Association said that they thought this proposal would allow for valuations of affected properties on an un-blighted basis and so help sustain local property markets.

This is HS2 Ltd's advice to government which examines, following consultation, the route selection process we adopted leading to identification of the consultation route for the first phase of HS2 between London and the West Midlands.

It examines a number of components of the scheme such as station choice, the case for intermediate stations, options for connecting to Heathrow and the location of an infrastructure maintenance depot.

It also examines the view expressed during consultation that, by more closely following existing transport corridors, or adopting a lower design speed on the consultation route, the impacts between London and the West Midlands, in particular environmental impacts, could be reduced.

This report considers the case for alternative corridors. Comparisons are made with the consultation route. However, in addition to this advice we have recommended a number of revisions to the consultation route that would further reduce sustainability impacts and construction costs.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-review-of-strategic-alternatives,Review of strategic alternatives to High Speed Two,A report by Network Rail on proposals to upgrade the existing rail network as alternative strategies to HS2.,"## Executive summary

The government's consultation on high speed rail proposed that a new line, called High Speed 2 (HS2), should be built initially between London and the West Midlands, to be extended to Manchester, the East Midlands and Yorkshire in a further phase of work. The new line would provide additional capacity as long distance services transfer from existing routes.

The Department for Transport (DfT) has asked Network Rail to review two proposals (produced by consultants for 51M1 and the DfT) that suggest alternative strategies to HS2, both of which aim to provide additional capacity on the West Coast Main Line (WCML). The DfT has also asked Network Rail to review a high level proposal of an alternative option that aims to provide additional capacity on the Midland Main Line (MML) and the East Coast Main Line (ECML).

The work undertaken to review the proposals has considered the outputs, feasibility, deliverability and costs of the interventions suggested on the WCML. The proposals both clearly provide benefits to some flows on the route, although this is at a cost to particular locations through loss of capacity or connectivity. The key issues identified are as follows:

  * neither proposal would provide sufficient capacity to meet forecast demand on the suburban commuter services at the south end of the WCML
  * the intensive off-peak service pattern in the alternative strategy produced for the DfT would mean that freight growth could not be accommodated
  * both proposals would likely necessitate remodelling at London Euston station
  * both proposals would result in long periods of disruption along the route while the infrastructure interventions are constructed
  * the high utilisation of the fast lines in both proposals would negatively impact on route performance
  * both service specifications increase long distance high speed (LDHS) connectivity on some flows, however this is at the expense of other intermediate flows, where connectivity severely worsens. In some cases this results in leaving stations without a train service.

The assessment of the proposals produced for the DfT to provide additional capacity on the ECML and the MML has also concluded that it is not a suitable long-term strategy for the corridors in question for the following reasons:

  * it is considered that neither route option could deliver the stated outputs with the infrastructure that is proposed
  * in some cases considerably more infrastructure could be required, such as terminal station remodelling or the building of additional running lines
  * both routes would undergo a lengthy and disruptive programme of significant infrastructure upgrades
  * the ECML proposition leaves no clear way to solve the capacity gap that is forecast on services from the outer suburban area.

Network Rail's assessment of the proposals has concluded that these incremental infrastructure and rolling stock enhancements are not the right solution to the overall capacity problem on the WCML. Whilst such improvements could provide some relief from overcrowding on certain services, they leave other issues unresolved and, as they fail to provide sufficient capacity for commuters at the south end of the WCML, do not solve the main capacity constraint that is the primary driver for intervention on the route.

There is a heavy disruption impact to deliver the enhancement projects in all three proposals, as each of the infrastructure interventions required to provide the proposed outputs necessarily affects the operational railway. This is on routes which are more popular and are being used more intensively than ever before.

Network Rail aims to provide a 'seven day railway' for its customers, minimising disruption, particularly on key interurban routes. When part of a route has to be closed diversionary routes are used where possible and if not, passenger journeys are transferred to buses. Freight traffic is even more difficult to accommodate elsewhere.

The cumulative impact of these separate schemes on current services (not including the growth expected in other markets that these outputs do not provide for) would be very significant, involving a sustained period of regular disruption on the WCML (and MML and ECML) similar to that required for the West Coast Route Modernisation (WCRM).

For some markets the proposals make the situation worse than today on the WCML, such as removing the capacity for freight growth in the strategy produced for DfT, leaving some stations without a train service (such as Stone and Atherstone) or the reduction in train service for stations south of Tring in 51M.

The cost estimates for the infrastructure interventions included in the proposals are broadly realistic, but the scope which has been priced is less than what would be required to deliver the proposed outputs (for example at London Euston station or for platform extensions), meaning the estimates are insufficient. The cost of disruption has also been underestimated.

The proposed interventions deliver considerably fewer benefits than a new line, particularly with regard to reduced journey times between urban centres and the ability to use the resultant freed capacity on the classic network to develop new markets and provide for continuing freight growth. So whilst some of the proposed enhancements may offer limited and short term opportunities for improving capacity on some areas of the route, the requirement for a new line to relieve capacity in the longer term remains and therefore would have to be delivered, in addition to these proposals, in any case.

This is HS2 Ltd's report to government which presents the outcomes of the review of responses to the consultation regarding the technical specification for HS2. The 'High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future' consultation was launched on 28th February 2011 with a closing date for responses of 29th July 2011. That consultation covered both the government's strategy for high speed rail, and the line of route for phase one from London to the West Midlands. Consultation responses expressed concern around a number of areas which this report specifically considers:

  * specifying proven technology
  * capacity of HS2: 18 trains per hour
  * a design speed of 250 mph (400 kph)
  * hours of operation
  * gauge of HS2 trains
  * the specification of the classic compatible trains
  * reliability
  * impact on other existing rail services
  * freight on HS2
  * interconnectivity with other transport networks
  * operational safety

To address these we established a programme to review existing work and, where appropriate, undertake new analysis. This work has highlighted a number of areas that would require careful consideration during the subsequent design stages of HS2 and its interface with the classic network and, if a decision is taken to proceed with HS2, we would seek to address these in our future work programme. We have also identified a small programme of adjustments to infrastructure on the West Coast Main Line (WCML) that would be needed to mitigate impacts on journey times for classic compatible services north of Lichfield. These have been included in revised cost estimates for HS2.

Overall, we conclude that the specification developed for HS2 is robust and appropriate for the stage of development of the project.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-strategic-alternatives-study-update,High speed rail strategic alternatives study: update following consultation,A report by Atkins examining the case for conventional rail alternatives to HS2.,"## Introduction

This document provides an update to the appraisal of the key Strategic Rail Alternatives to the HS2 proposition. The report outlines the appraisal of the alternatives being considered. It summarises the interventions developed, examines the Capital and Operating Costs, and then details the Economic Appraisal of the Alternatives.

Atkins was appointed by the Department for Transport (DfT) in August 2009, to consider road and rail improvement alternatives to the High Speed Rail proposition being developed by High Speed Two (HS2) Ltd. The main objective of HS2 Ltd at the time was to consider the case for new high speed services between London and the West Midlands. However, in appraising the HS2 business case and in approving the proposed investment decisions, it was necessary for DfT to also appraise a range of strategic alternatives to HS2 as comparators. Atkins therefore developed an incremental range of road and rail interventions on the existing road and rail networks between London and the West Midlands, designed both to increase capacity, and to bring down journey times on this corridor. These were then costed, modelled in terms of the impact on revenue and appraised to allow them to be compared with the HS2 proposals.

Atkins was subsequently re-engaged by the Department for Transport (DfT) in October 2010 to appraise a set of strategic alternatives to the government's overall proposed high speed rail strategy for a Y-shaped network linking London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. These scenarios were developed by DfT and included enhancements to not only the existing line between London and the West Midlands, but also the East Coast Main Line (ECML) and the Midland Main Line (MML). Atkins' economic appraisal of these alternatives to the proposed Y network was published as part of the suite of HS2 consultation documents.

Alongside this work, Atkins was also commissioned to update the original economic appraisal of the London to West Midlands Strategic Rail Alternatives, to be consistent with the latest assessment of the HS2 London to West Midlands scheme.

Further to the HS2 Consultation process, further updates of the key Strategic Alternative packages have been commissioned, which are the subject of this report. These updates have concentrated on Rail Package 2, and its variants (including a package proposed by 51M, a grouping of local authorities), as this package was found to offer the most credible alternative to the business case for HS2 between London and the West Midlands and attracted the most comment in consultation responses, and on Scenario B as the most credible alternative to the wider HS2 'Y' Network.

These Strategic Alternatives have been revised, in this document, to take account of:

  * the updated HS2 model (2010 baseline) - which itself takes account of recent high growth in demand on the West Coast Main Line following completion of the West Coast Route Modernisation (WCRM) programme and recent timetable changes
  * feedback from the HS2 Consultation process, and from a report on the key alternatives which was commissioned by the Department for Transport from Network Rail in the light of the interest in these schemes raised in consultation

At the same time and, in parallel, Atkins has taken the opportunity to review some of the assumptions used previously and add greater detail to the modelling, which has in some cases been able to ensure greater consistency between HS2 and the Strategic Alternatives.

The 2011 consultation on high speed rail was one of the largest consultations ever undertaken by the Department for Transport. It attracted almost 55,000 responses. A full and detailed analysis of these responses was undertaken by an independent response analysis company, Dialogue by Design (DbyD).

DfT decided to commission supplementary analysis of the consultation responses from its In House Analytical Consultancy. This analysis focuses on looking at the difference in responses from people in different areas in the country or from different groups.

This Order makes changes to the Humber Bridge Board (""the Board""). By this Order, the number of constituent authorities (the local authorities authorised to appoint members to the Board) is altered, firstly by the removal of Lincolnshire County Council as a constituent authority and then by the addition of North East Lincolnshire Council as a constituent authority. This Order also reduces the number of members each constituent authority can appoint to the Board to one. In consequence, this Order also reduces the total number of members of the Board appointed by constituent authorities to four. This Order makes a consequential amendment to the number of members who can convene a special meeting of the Board by reducing it to two.

The Department's Information Asset Register (IAR) is a table of information relating to the important datasets that the Department is responsible for. These information assets are managed in line with Cabinet Office guidance to ensure that the data within them is appropriately protected.

The Information Asset Register is a live document, and the style of entries varies because text is entered by the individuals responsible for managing the assets - the Information Asset Owners, across the Department and its Executive Agencies. The IAR will be updated annually.

A number of assets where Freedom of Information exclusions on publication apply have been excluded from the published list but the number of these amounts to less than 1% of the total number of assets held.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/information-on-the-implementation-of-security-scanners,Information on the implementation of security scanners,Background and FAQ on the introduction of security scanners at UK airports.,"## Introduction and background

In response to the attempted attack on Northwest airlines flight 253 to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, the government conducted an immediate review of aviation security measures. The findings of this review were announced on 5 January 2010. The announcement outlined a package of additional measures to enhance aviation security. These measures included:

  * an increase in the use of explosive trace detection
  * plans for greater random searching of passengers
  * the introduction of security scanners also know as body scanners or Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)

## Security scanners

On 1 February 2010 the deployment of security scanners at Heathrow and Manchester Airports, and the intention to roll-out scanners nationally during the following months was announced. An interim code of practice was published at the same time which ensured that the operation of security scanners would be mindful of privacy, health and safety, data protection and equality issues. The interim code of practice was subject to a public consultation, the outcome of which was announced on 21 November, alongside a final code of practice.

## The code of practice and security scanner directions

The code of practice requires airports to undertake scanning sensitively, having regard to the rights of passengers. It states that passengers will not be selected to be scanned on the basis of ethnic origin, gender, or destination of travel.

There are further requirements that the airport operators must follow in the public annexes of the security scanner directions that protect the privacy of passengers. All the security scanner directions are available.

## Health and safety

There are currently two types of security scanner commercially available using either millimetre wave or backscatter X-ray technology to produce grey images (see [FAQs for more details](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/information-on-the-implementation-of-security-scanners/)).

Concerns about the health risks from the X-ray type of scanner have been assessed by many independent international bodies. Additionally the Department for Transport commissioned its own independent assessment of the Rapiscan secure 1000 security scanner (one type currently in use) from the UK Health Protection Agency. Tests have concluded that the dose received from being scanned is far below the allowed levels in the UK and does not constitute any unacceptable risks to health.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/infrastructure-and-cyclist-safety,Infrastructure and cyclist safety,A literature review to consider the role of infrastructure in the causation and reduction of injuries to cyclists.,"## Summary

The Department for Transport commissioned TRL to conduct a literature review to consider the role of infrastructure in the causation and reduction of injuries to cyclists. It was undertaken as part of the wider research programme, Road User Safety and Cycling, being led by TRL.

Overall, it proved problematic to draw definitive conclusions from the literature. Taken as a whole, the most significant infrastructure-related risk factors for cyclists in single vehicle incidents on highways appear to be; slippery road (due to weather), and poor or defective road surface. For multi-vehicle collisions the infrastructure risk factors appear to be; posted speed limits, and encounters with other road users at junctions.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/international-carriage-of-dangerous-goods,International carriage of dangerous goods,Information and regulations on the international transport of dangerous goods.,"International work on the carriage of dangerous goods centres on the United Nations [Committee of Experts](http://www.unece.org/trans/main/dgdb/dgcomm/ac10age.html) and related ad hoc specialist groups. The role of the UN, and the way in which the Department for Transport (DfT) and other Departments and agencies work with UN Committees and specialist groups falls under five headings:

1. International carriage - role of the UN  
2. International carriage by road  
2a. Multilateral Agreements (MAs)  
3. International carriage by rail  
4. International carriage by sea  
5. International carriage by air

## International carriage - role of the UN

The principal international agreement, on which all other dangerous goods controls are grounded, is the _United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods_ (UNRTDG, known as the 'Orange Book'). The 'Orange Book' sets out recommendations for the classification and labelling dangerous goods and requirements for packaging, tanks and containers. Although these recommendations have no legal force, they present a basic scheme of provisions that allows uniform development of national and international regulations. The recommendations have legal force only when they are adopted into modal (mode-specific) agreements or domestic legislation. Modal agreements and domestic legislation can go beyond the 'Orange Book', by including additional modal and domestic requirements.

  * [Orange Book](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/what.htm)

_The United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria_ (UNMTC) sets out test methods and criteria to assist national competent authorities and consignors in the accurate classification of dangerous goods. The UNMTC does not set out any duties, merely technical information on testing - the intention being that the outcome of testing should inform the determination of a correct classification. As with the UNRTDG, the UNMTC only has legal force when referred to by modal agreements and domestic legislation.

  * [UNMTC](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/manual/manual_e.html)

## International carriage by road

International regulation of the carriage of dangerous goods by road within Europe is achieved via the _European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road_ which was drawn up by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in Geneva. The Agreement is more commonly known as ""ADR"" (from _**A**ccord Europeen Relatif au Transport International des Marchandises **D**angereuses par **R**oute_).

  * [UNEC](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/danger.htm))
  * [ADR](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/adr2011/11contentse.html)
  * [Current Contracting Parties to ADR](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/treaty.html)

The provisions of ADR set out how producers/consignors and carriers should classify, package, label and transport dangerous goods. Also included are specific vehicle and tank requirements and various other operational requirements such as driver training.

A body of international experts, known as WP.15, meets twice a year at the UN in Geneva to discuss and update ADR; the current version is 2009. The 2009 version is also available in hard copy from either the UNECE or TSO book shops.

  * [WP.15](http://www.unece.org/trans/main/dgdb/wp15/wp15age.html)
  * [UNECE book shop](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/order.htm)
  * [TSO book shop](http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1160739andAction=BookandProductID=9789211391312andFrom=Subject)

### Multilateral Agreements (MAs)

The purpose of ADR MAs is to allow a temporary derogation of up to 5 years from the provisions of ADR. In other words, carriers or consignors may follow the specifications set out in the MA rather than in the corresponding text of ADR. From a UK perspective, MAs are sometimes used where UK practice has differed for historical reasons, although this is becoming less common as ADR now forms the basis for domestic legislation.

A MA may also be appropriate in situations where WP.15 has agreed, but not yet formally adopted, changes which countries may wish to implement more quickly. Carriage of dangerous goods under the terms of a MA can only be undertaken between and on the territory of those Contracting Parties which have signed the Agreement (RID MAs operate on a broadly similar basis to ADR MAs).

  * [ADR MAs](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/multi/multi.htm)

## International carriage by rail

The international carriage of dangerous goods by rail within Europe is governed by Annex I of the _Convention Concerning International Carriage by Rail_ ( [COTIF](http://www.unece.org/trade/cotif/Welcome.html), from _**C**onvention de l'**O**rganisation Intergouvernmentale pour les **T**ransports **I**nternationaux **F**erroviaires_).

Annex I is the _Regulations Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail_. It is more commonly known as "" [RID](http://www.otif.org/)"" (from _**R**eglement Concernant le Transport **I**nternational Ferroviaire des Marchandises **D**angereuses_).

RID is published by [OTIF](http://www.otif.org) (the _Central Office for International Carriage by Rail_, or _**O**ffice Central des **T**ransports **I**nternationaux **F**erroviaires_), and updated every two years (current edition 2009). Any amendments to the Regulations are discussed and agreed by the RID Committee of Experts. An English translation of RID is available from [TSO](http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1159997andDI=607571andtrackid=002289).

## International carriage by sea

The principal international rules for the carriage of packaged dangerous goods by sea are published in the [International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code](http://www.imo.org/publications/documents/newsletters%20and%20mailers/mailers/ih200e_%202.pdf) which closely reflects the UN Model Regulations. Amendments to the IMDG Code are the responsibility of IMO sub-committees. The carriage of goods _in bulk_ in ships is covered by separate codes such as the _International Bulk Chemical Code_ and the _International Gas Carrier Code_. The [IMO](http://www.imo.org/) is based in London; the UK's [Maritime and Coastguard Agency](http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home.htm), an agency of the Department for Transport (DfT), plays (in consultation with industry) a leading part in its deliberations.

## International carriage by air

[ICAO's](http://www.icao.int/) _Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air ( [ICAO Technical Instructions](http://www.icao.int/safety/DangerousGoods/Pages/technical-instructions.aspx)_ ) - which are closely aligned with the UN Model Regulations - cover the following: classification of substances and articles; their packing (including specifications and tests for packaging); the marking and labelling of packages; the documentation of consignments; the acceptance procedures to be used by air operators (including the inspection of packages for leakage or damage) and the loading of dangerous goods on aircraft and the training of personnel involved in the transport of dangerous goods by air.

The Dangerous Goods Panel of ICAO recommends to the ICAO Air Navigation Commission (ANC) what amendments to the Technical Instructions are required. The ANC, in turn, recommends the changes to the Council, which gives approval to the publication of revised Instructions published every two years. The UK, as a Contracting State of ICAO, is required to take the necessary measures to achieve compliance with the ICAO Technical Instructions. Airline operators also require compliance with [IATA's](http://www.iata.org/index.htm) '_[Dangerous Goods Regulations](http://www.iata.org/search.htm?q=dangerous+goodsandsc=all)_'.

Transport Direct has currently achieved over 81 million user sessions since its launch in December 2004.

The Transport Direct Portal provides a one-stop-shop for users to make **intelligent travel choices** based on its rich set of travel and transport information and services. Part of **connecting people to places** is to provide information on the places. This can provide extremely useful context for the user's journey by, for example, providing a map of the area or showing the nearest car parks to the ultimate destination (Figure 3). What could affect my journey? The Transport Direct Portal provides up-to-the-minute travel news for both public transport and the road network. This provides details of planned engineering and road works as well as incidents that have recently happened and are still ongoing (for example, Figure 4). With such information, the user may wish to re-plan their journey, choosing a different route, time or even mode of travel. The location and travel news information better helps the user to make **intelligent travel choices** and, as such, makes better use of the transport infrastructure.

Transport Direct achieves an average of:

  * 378,000  user sessions per week
  * 2,000,000 pages per week
  * 12,500 mobile pages per week
  * 5,300 mobile user sessions per week
  * 10,100 Digital TV Web pages per week
  * 830 Digital TV User sessions per week

A set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were set out in Transport Direct's original business plan in order to assess the effectiveness of Transport Direct, including:

  * Initial achievement of one million unique visitor sessions in the first year of operation to confirm visibility and usage.  **This was achieved in June 2005, six months after launch.**
  * A goal of ten million unique visitor sessions by 2006 to establish Transport Direct as a major source of travel and transport information. **This was achieved on 1st December 2006.**

On 7 February the Department announced £15m of new funding for sustainable travel projects across the country that will promote economic growth and cut carbon. This is in addition to the £560m Local Sustainable Transport Fund.

This Community Linking Places Fund and is primarily for improvements to cycling and walking. In addition the fund must be used to support jobs, enhance access to employment and encourage greater use of more environmentally friendly transport.

The £15m fund has been split between Sustrans - the UK transport charity - and the Cycle Rail Working Group (CRWG) - the body which brings together representatives of the rail industry and the cycling sector. Sustrans will receive £8m for projects to enhance cycle routes across England. The remaining £7m will be allocated through CRWG to improve integration between cycle and rail at stations.

Criteria for being awarded funding included meeting the above objectives along with attracting funding from other sources and complementing local initiatives which aim to support the economy. The Minister for Transport has approved all the schemes that will benefit from this new funding.

**1. (iii)** It is a requirement for being listed that you transfer, on request, mandatory training, recruitment and vetting records to another company/partnership should any of your staff transfer to that company/partnership.

### 2. Informing the DfT of Changes

It will be the responsible person's responsibility to ensure that the DfT is notified of any major changes in the operation. The DfT must be notified within 14 days if:

a) The company/partnership enters into a new contract with a Directed Party;

b) A contract ceases;

c) The company or partnership changes name or location;

d) The overall responsibility is assigned to anyone other than the person named at point 3 (i);

e) There are any other changes or procedures likely to significantly impact on your listed status (eg conviction for a terrorist-related offence).

### 3. (i) Responsible Person (E.g. Senior Security Manager/Senior Partner)

This should be the person who is applying on behalf of the company/partnership and who will be assuming responsibility for making sure that the company/partnership remains compliant with the criteria for an approved listing. If the responsible person has security clearance, please state the level of security clearance and any expiry date eg

Basic Check (BC) = verified references and criminal record check;

Counter-Terrorist Check (CTC) = a BC plus a check of Security Service records;

Security Check (SC) = a CTC plus a credit check;

Developed Vetting (DV) = SC plus additional checks.

The responsible person must provide their name, position in the company/partnership, what security clearance they hold (if any) and full registered business address. They must also sign and date this section in the presence of a witness. NB - It is a DfT requirement that we are informed in writing within 14 days of a new responsible person taking over.

### 3. (ii) Witness (eg Company Secretary/Partner)

A witness is required to countersign the application. This should be the most senior person in the structure of the organisation who has the authority to bind the application. They must sign and date at the same time and in the presence of the responsible person.

The witness must provide their name, position in the company/partnership, what security clearance they hold (if any) and their business address.

## Part B - Security Functions by Location

**Complete a separate Part B for each location.**

### 1. Location

Please submit a separate Part B for each location. Note that providers operating at major airports with multiple terminals must complete a separate Part B for each terminal eg one Part B for all functions at Gatwick North and another for Gatwick South. A separate Part B is required for each of the following terminals:

Heathrow Terminal 1 Manchester Terminal 1

Heathrow Terminal 2 Manchester Terminal 2

Heathrow Terminal 3 Manchester Terminal 4

Heathrow Terminal 4

## Overall Assessment

DfT will list the functions provided by your company/partnership at the locations quoted on this form, unless the Department is satisfied that the function is not being delivered to the required standard. The required standard is that determined by the DfT in relevant Directions made under Part II of the Aviation Security Act 1982 (as amended) and the National Aviation Security Programme (NASP) and is the same for both Directed Parties and their agents. **If the function is listed once the Regulations come into effect, you will be required to maintain the required standards. Failure to do so may result in being de-listed and or the Directed Party being served an enforcement notice.**

## Notice of Decision

The DfT may wish to undertake an inspection of the function as part of the assessment of this application.

Thereafter, the DfT will notify the company/partnership of whether or not, and on what day, the company/partnership was placed on the list of approved providers. Listing will expire after a period of 5 years from that day. The company/partnership can apply for a renewal listing no sooner than 2 months before the date of expiry.

If the company/partnership is not successful, the DfT will notify the applicant and state the reasons why listing was refused. The applicant will be notified of the appeals procedure and entitled to appeal and or reapply. A re-application will be considered, provided that it is submitted with an action plan stating the measures to be taken and the targets for achieving compliance.",guidance,increasing-international-competitiveness-of-uk-airlines-and-airports,ensuring-transport-systems-are-secure-and-resilient,,department-for-transport,,,,16-Mar-2006,,,,,http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/pgr-security-aviation-listedsecurityprovidersaviation/listingapplicationparta.doc,Listing application part A - General company/partnership information,http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/pgr-security-aviation-listedsecurityprovidersaviation/listingapplicationpartb.doc,Listing application part B - Security functions by location,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-speed-limits-guidance,Setting local speed limits,Guidance to authorities on the setting of local speed limits.,"## Summary

Speed limits should be evidence-led, self-explaining and seek to reinforce people's assessment of what is a safe speed to travel. They should encourage self-compliance and  
not be seen by drivers as being a target speed at which to drive in all circumstances.

Traffic authorities set 'local speed limits' in situations where local needs and considerations deem it desirable for drivers to adopt a speed which is different from the  
national speed limit. Local speed limits could be reduced or increased, depending upon the conditions and evidence.

This guidance is to be used for setting all local speed limits on single and dual carriageway roads in both urban and rural areas.

This guidance should also be used as the basis for future assessments of local speed limits, for developing route management strategies and for developing the speed management strategies required as part of the Local Transport Plan process.

Traffic authorities are asked to review the speed limits on all of their A and B roads, and implement any necessary changes, by 2011 in accordance with this guidance.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/logic-mapping-advice-guide,Logic mapping: hints and tips guide,"Providing policy makers, evaluators, local authorities and partnership organisations with helpful hints and tips to consider when carrying out logic mapping.","This guide to logic mapping has been developed with the aim of giving more in-depth advice on developing logic maps to inform the planning, design and evaluation of transport interventions.

Logic mapping is a tool for articulating underlying and implicit assumptions of what changes will occur, the delivery steps which need to be undertaken to achieve the anticipated changes and the external factors which will also influence the outcome. Therefore, this guide will be of interest to policy makers, evaluators, local authorities and partnership organisations.

To promote best practice in transport evaluations the Department for Transport has published an accessible step-by-step guide to evaluation design (Guidance for Transport Impact Evaluations). A key principle within the guide is to encourage evaluation planners to clarify exactly how the intervention will deliver anticipated outcomes and contribute to wider impacts. Step three of the impact evaluation guidance recommends mapping the intervention logic to inform the design of the evaluation and this guide will provide practical support to evaluation planners undertaking this process.

The three chapters take the reader through the following step-by-step processes, with tips, ideas, practical suggestions and common hurdles highlighted throughout.

**Chapter 1: Logic mapping and its uses  
** What are logic maps, what are their components and what is their purpose?

**Chapter 2: Step-by-step guide to logic mapping  
** How do you go about populating each element of a logic map?  Best practice, useful hints and tips.

**Chapter 3: Using logic maps as part of an evaluation strategy  
** How can logic maps be used throughout the evaluation process?  eg defining the evaluation questions, deciding on the evaluation criteria and data sources or analysing the data.

The Logistics Growth Review presents a diverse package of measures that targets the key barriers to growth identified by the logistics industry and its users. Logistics is one of the sectors being focussed on as part of the second phase of the Growth Review, set out within the government's Plan for Growth. Its aim is to fundamentally examine the conditions for logistics sector success, and to identify what actions government can take to address barriers to growth of the industry.

This would allow an increase to the cubic volume of loads carried by articulated lorries and the possible introduction of safer aerodynamic fronts. The added capacity could be beneficial to those carrying lighter goods or those packed at low densities, but not to those shipping heavier bulk goods.

The Department for Transport is conducting a trial of 1800 longer semi-trailers, starting in January 2012.

The trial involves 900 semi-trailers of 14.6m in length (ie 1 metre longer than the current maximum), and a further 900 semi-trailers of 15.65m in length (ie 2.05 metres longer). This would bring the total maximum length of the articulated vehicle to 17.5 metres for the first trial category and 18.55 metres for the second. The trial will provide the opportunity to establish the impacts of each length.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/low-carbon-vehicle-public-procurement-programme,The Low Carbon Vehicle Public Procurement Programme Support for low carbon vans,Funding of up to £1.7m is now available for any public fleet buyers to purchase a further 500 low carbon vans from the procurement framework.,"## Summary

The government's Low Carbon Vehicle Public Procurement Programme (LCVPPP) was set up in 2007 to help stimulate the market for lower carbon vehicles. It has provided financial assistance to public sector organisations wishing to procure innovative, lower carbon vehicles for their fleets.

In its first phase, the programme has provided funding to support the trial of over 200 electric and low emission vans in a range of public fleets. The LCVPPP is allowing for the collection of 'real-world' data about the vehicles' performance and usage, helping to drive ongoing technological development; as well as demonstrate the existing capabilities of these vehicles.

In November 2011, OLEV Ministers took the decision to allow Ashwoods, supplier of the low carbon van, to continue into the second phase of the programme. Further funding of up to GBP1.7m is now available for any public fleet buyers to purchase a further 500 low carbon vans from the procurement framework.

For the first 500 vans, OLEV will provide a grant of GBP3,430 per van to discount the additional cost, which is expected not to be necessary as volumes grow further.

## How to apply

The vehicle ordering and grant payment process is summarised: contact David Balchin or Martin Kadhim of Ashwoods by to request a brochure and discuss the order: 

 * [david.balchin@ashwoods.org](mailto:david.balchin@ashwoods.org?subject=A%20request%20for%20an%20LVCPPP%20brochure) or
 * [martin.kadhim@ashwoods.org](mailto:martin.kadhim@ashwoods.org?subject=A%20request%20for%20an%20LVCPPP%20brochure) or 
 * call Ashwoods on 01392 340417

On receipt of your order, a letter will be sent back to you confirming the grant amount, and what you will need to do when the vehicle arrives and receive the grant discounted price.

If you have any queries please email them to: [Ian Turner](mailto:ian.turner@dft.gsi.gov.uk).

## Grant support without use of the framework

This DfT framework was set in place following an OJEU notice tender process, allowing hybrid vans to be procured / leased by public sector bodies directly with Ashwoods, with grant support.

If a public sector body chooses to procure Ashwoods vans without using the DfT framework, they may do so. This may be appropriate if their frameworks include a preferred van supplier, or dealership, to supply vehicles suitable for the hybrid conversion by Ashwoods. The onus would then be on that public sector body to ensure that the order was compliant with the Public Procurement Regulations. Grant support would still be available, provided that the purchase order and letter documents are supplied to DfT to confirm that the order is eligible for the grant. The documentation required is detailed in the Vehicle Ordering and Payment Process flowcharts. Purchasers would also want to ensure that the van price was no less favourable than that agreed in the DfT framework. DfT cannot accept any procurement liability for orders placed outside the DfT framework.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/low-cost-electrification-for-branch-lines,Low Cost Electrification for Branch Lines,Establishing if it can be economically feasible to electrify low-usage branch lines on the National Rail Network.,"## Summary

This report has been prepared as a result of work undertaken for the Department for Transport (DfT) Research Project: Low-Cost Electrification.

The objective of the research is to establish if it can be economically feasible to electrify low-usage branch lines on the National Rail Network. Such lines are currently operated using diesel multiple unit (DMU) type rolling stock and it is considered that replacing these with modern tram-type electric vehicles can offer the following benefits:

  * Reduced operating costs, particularly with regard to rolling stock
  * Immunity from short-term fluctuations of fuel costs
  * A reduction in overall carbon emissions
  * Reduced impact on the local environment (air quality and noise levels)
  * Improved passenger experience

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ltn-01-11,Shared space,Changing the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles.,"## Summary

Shared space is a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.  

In the UK, shared space is usually applied to links and minor junctions with the aim of allowing pedestrians to move more freely within the space. This Local Transport Note (LTN) focuses on High Street environments, but many of its principles will apply to other types of shared space.

The Manual for Streets has won a Royal Town Planning Institute prize. The award recognises that the Manual for Streets is radically changing designers' and local authorities' approach to residential street design for the better.

The Manual for Streets emphasises that streets should be places in which people want to live and spend time in, and are not just transport corridors. In particular, the manual aims to reduce the impact of vehicles on residential streets by asking practitioners to plan street design intelligently and proactively, and gives a high priority to the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and users of public transport.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/manual-for-streets-2,Manual for streets 2,Guidance and case studies on how the philosophies set out in the Manual for Streets can be extended beyond residential streets to encompass both urban and rural situations.,"## Summary

Manual for Streets 2 - Wider Application of the Principles, a companion guide to Manual for Streets, was published by the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) on 29 September 2010.

Manual for Streets 2 builds on the philosophies set out in Manual for Streets and demonstrates through guidance and case studies how they can be extended beyond residential streets to encompass both urban and rural situations. It fills the perceived gap in design advice that lies between Manual for Streets and the design standards for trunk roads as set out in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges. It will help everyone involved in the planning, construction and improvement of our streets to deliver more contextually sensitive designs.

Manual for Streets 2 is not available from the Department for Transport. Please use the link below for more information, including how you can order copies from the CIHT.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/mini-roundabouts,Mini roundabouts,The purpose of this document is to pull together this wealth of experience so that it can be shared with all those involved in the various aspects of highway management and the usage of mini roundabouts.,"## Summary

The modern concept of a mini-roundabout was introduced in the UK in the early 1970s as a means to improve capacity and reduce delays at existing junctions where there was limited scope to introduce other forms of control. Since that time, most local authorities have developed their use to address other issues such as casualty reduction and as a speedreducing feature within traffic-calmed areas. There are about 5,000 mini-roundabouts around the country and a great deal of experience has been gained in their application.

The purpose of this document is to pull together this wealth of experience so that it can be shared with all those involved in the various aspects of highway management.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/mobility-scooters-road-guidance,Mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs on the road - some guidance for users,The government is committed to helping people who have mobility difficulties to get around.,"## Summary

The government is committed to helping people who have mobility difficulties to get around. This is so that people can remain active members of the community and maintain their independence. Traditionally, mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs have been used by those with mobility difficulties; as the population ages, more elderly people are likely to use mobility scooters, which are considerably less expensive than powered wheelchairs. Both provide a means of getting around the neighbourhood and to local shops, for those unable to walk or having difficulty in walking.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/motorcycle-review-seminar,Motorcycle test review seminar,,"## Summary

Around 160 -170 trainers from around 80 Approved Training Bodies, attended the Motorcycle Test Review Seminar on the 6th July. 

The main issues that came out during the seminar arising from comments made and questions asked, and from the subsequent written questions, were concerns about accessibility of the test and the suggested timescales. There was also concerns about safety if certain elements of the test that are currently carried out off-road were moved on-road but there was overall support for a single event test.  

## Safety

A research contract was let to the Transport Research Laboratory in July 2011. Phase 1 of the research will involve holding independent trials with test level candidates to verify standards, suitability and safety of the proposed new manoeuvres, using mock road layouts at off road sites. Some of the new manoeuvres are different from those in the current module1 test and have been designed to be suitable for on-road as well as off-road sites. Phase 2 of the research, which will follow later, will take place on the road and will identify the criteria for suitable on-road sites and determine the requirements for the safe conduct of the test on-road, so that candidates are not put at unnecessary risk.

## Accessibility

One of the main aims of the test review is to improve accessibility. The key to this is the ability to conduct a single event test on-road. Assuming that the research finds that the test can be carried out safely on-road and suitable roads are identified, then it may be possible to provide tests in gap areas that are currently not served by an off-road MPTC. We are considering new manoeuvres that can be performed in an equivalent way either on-road or off-road and there may be a mixed approach by maintaining the current MMAs and supplementing accessibility by a fully on-road test in those areas that are not currently well served, at least for a transitional period; but the content of the test will be the same for all candidates, wherever it is taken. 

In the meantime, to try and minimise the distance that some learner riders have to travel for their module1 tests, DSA are using casual sites and shared VOSA sites to try and minimise any service gaps. They are also continuing to look at introducing further casual site arrangements, in the areas most affected.

## Timetable

We are moving as quickly as we can to deliver a more accessible test but we need to be sure that any changes we make really do deliver improvements. We don't want to rush into changes that might not work in practice.

The timetable presented at the seminar suggested bringing in the new manoeuvres and a single event test during Winter 2012/13. The research needed to establish the safety and practicality of the new manoeuvres, will take place in autumn 2011 (Phase 1) and spring 2012 (Phase 2). There will also need to be a public consultation on the proposed changes, which we plan to hold mid 2012 in the light of the findings of the Phase 2 research. 

Subject to the outcome of the consultation, we will then need to make new legislation to implement the new test, which is likely to take until at least autumn 2012. So Winter 2012/13 is the earliest possible time for implementation of the new test. We would expect to introduce a single event test and the new maneouvres in all test locations at this time.

The new manoeuvres would initially be provided in on-road locations, only in gap areas that are not well served by the off-road test centres but those off-road test centres would still be used where available. This will be a transition period, as the new manoeuvres are monitored to ensure their safety in practice. The manoeuvres would then be transferred from off-road test centres to on-road locations, as suitable sites are identified in each test location around the country. This will take place over a period of time, while suitable sites are identified in every test location in all parts of the country, before the transition to on-road testing in all areas is complete. There would need to be on-going dialogue with stakeholders over this process and review of the initial implementation to ensure any issues are resolved.

The Motorcycle Test Review has been considering alternative ways of providing a motorcycle test that maintains UK riding standards and improves accessibility and safety for test candidates, while meeting the requirements of the European legislation. We have made progress in identifying potential alternative manoeuvres and the kinds of location that could be suitable. Work is underway to evaluate these options to see if they are feasible, safe and deliverable in all areas.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/night-flying-restrictions,"Night Flying Restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports","Background information regarding the decision to extend the existing night noise regime at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted for two years.","Under Section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, the government sets noise controls at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports. With regard to night noise, these measures include a restriction on the number of movements and a quota count system. A movement is either a take off or landing. The quota count system works by allocating points according to how noisy an aircraft is. Aircraft are certified by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) according to the noise they produce. The current night noise regime for these airports was announced in June 2006 and came into force in October 2006. It ends on 28 October 2012.

The government has decided to extend the existing night noise regime at these airports for two years until the end of summer season 2014, when a new regime will come into force.

The night flying restrictions are divided into summer and winter seasons. The summer season is the period of British Summer Time in any one year. The winter season is the period between the end of British Summer Time in one year and the start of British Summer Time in the next.

For the Summer 2012 season, which commences on 25 March 2012 and ends on 28 October 2012, the movement limits and quota points allowance for the airports are:

Airport Movement Limits Noise Quota Points

Heathrow
3250
5100

Gatwick
11200
6200

Stansted
7000
4650

These movement limits and noise quota points apply to the night quota period which is 23.30 to 06.00.

The movement limits and noise quota points allowance for summer 2013 and summer 2014 will remain the same as for summer 2012, as set out in the table above.

For winter 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 the movement limits and quota points allowance for the airports are:

Airport Movement Limits Noise Quota Points

Heathrow
2550
4080

Gatwick
3250
2000

Stansted
5000
3310

All other aspects of the current regime will remain in place during the two year extension period.

## Indicative Timetable for Replacing Night Flying Regime

Date  

March 2012
Announcement of two year extension to current regime.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/noise-exposure-contours-1997-2009,Noise exposure contours around London airports,Noise exposure reports and contours for London airports (Heathrow- Gatwick and Stansted).,"## Summary

The Environmental Research and Consultancy Department (ERCD) of the Civil Aviation Authority estimates the noise exposures around the London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) on behalf of the Department for Transport. The magnitude and extent of the aircraft noise around these airports are depicted on maps by contours of constant aircraft noise index (Leq) values. The contours are generated by a computer model validated with noise measurements, which calculates the emissions and propagation of noise from arriving and departing air traffic.

## Detail

ERCD produce annual reports on noise exposure contours at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and previous copies of these - back to 1997- are available on this website. These are detailed reports and essential reading for those wishing to understand both how noise exposure contours are produced and how they should be interpreted.

The annual reports include small scale diagrams of noise exposure contours which provide an overall impression of their proximity to major towns.

For those wishing to see more detailed representation of noise exposure contours on the ground, ERCD also produces contours overlaid on larger scale Ordnance Survey paper maps ( 1:50,000 ) or, more recently, in AutoCad DXF format (previously supplied on CD-ROM), the latter primarily used by specialist users such as town planners, consultants etc. Both of these have traditionally been available for purchase from the Department as described in the annual reports.

## Change to presentation of 2005 contours onwards

Annual reports for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are available on the website as before.

With effect from 2005, additional representation of noise exposure contours on Ordnance Survey maps has been made available on this website in two formats.

## PDF

**For the non specialist user** in particular, a PDF version of each of the large scale Ordnance Survey maps is available for viewing and downloading. Please note, however, that these are large documents and may take some time to download.

  * [Contours on OS maps](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/noise-exposure-contours-on-os-maps-2008-2009)

## AutoCad DXF

**For the specialist user** requiring greater detail, AutoCad DXF files are available on the website for download. (These allow the user to plot the contours on any scale of map).

Please note that in order to gain the best reproduction of contours on a larger scale Ordnance Survey map, it is necessary to have software that is capable of reading DXF files.

Please also note that in view of the large size of the files, they have been compressed using WinZip and will need to be 'unzipped' after being downloaded.

## Printed Maps

Contours overlaid on large scale Ordnance Survey paper maps (1:50,000) continue to be available, at a charge, as described in the annual reports. Although the information/scale presented is exactly same as in the PDF version (see above), the printed maps are larger.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/overcrowded-train-services,London and South East 'top ten' overcrowded train services,The ten most overcrowded rail services in spring 2010 and autumn 2010.,"The Department collects rail passenger counts from train operating companies (TOCs) to monitor train crowding levels. All franchises let by the DfT require the train operator to address crowding and to plan their timetables in such a way as to ensure, as far as possible, that crowding is not unduly concentrated on any particular route or individual service. The tables included in the papers below show the ten most overcrowded services.

The Penfold Review of Non-Planning Consents was commissioned the Department of Business Innovation and Skills (BIS). The Review was charged with the identification of measures to reduce the regulatory burden imposed on developers by the need to obtain additional consents and approvals after they have secured the grant of planning permission for their development proposals. Such requirements cause delay and costs. On occasion, these can render the development concerned non-viable.

Any questions should be directed to the Vetting Team Manager at [personnelsecurity@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:personnelsecurity@dft.gsi.gov.uk)

## What is national security vetting?

The Cabinet Office provides advice and guidance for individuals who are subject to HMG recruitment and national security vetting controls:

  * [HMG Personnel Security Controls (PDF, 293 KB)](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/hmg-personnel-security-controls.pdf)

The Department for Transport (DfT) has defined in Directions the specific roles and duties across the regulated transport industry for which national security vetting (NSV) is required, as well as the type of clearance required. These Directions have not been published for reasons of national security but have been made available to the industry.

Please note that only defined roles are eligible for NSV clearance and that all applications must be made through a nominated industry sponsor authorised by DfT. Speculative applications will not be considered.

### Instructions

1. This process is for individuals in the regulated transport sector who have been directly instructed by their employer or DfT that they require a national security vetting (NSV) clearance.

Please note that applications must be made through a nominated industry sponsor authorised by DfT. Speculative applications will **not** be considered.

2. Applicants should read the latest HM government Personnel Security and National Security Vetting Policy Statement prior to completing the security questionnaire

  * [HMG Personnel Security Controls (PDF, 293 KB)](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/hmg-personnel-security-controls.pdf)

3. The HMG Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) in recruitment practice, outlined in the statement above, must also be met. However, please note that a basic criminal records disclosure from Disclosure Scotland or Access Northern Ireland is **not** required prior to submitting the questionnaire.

4. **The application process is moving to an online system.Details to follow soon.**

## Relevant offences

**These offences apply only to applications for national security vetting in the transport sector regulated by the Department for Transport (DfT).**

**Relevant offences for use against a criminal record check (basic disclosure) to complete a background check in the regulated aviation sector are availalbe at [disqualifying convictions aviation](/publications/crc-disqualifying-convictions-aviation).**

All types of national security vetting (NSV) include a check of criminal record information. 

Please note that a conviction for a relevant offence listed below is **not** necessarily a bar to NSV clearance. DfT will consider on a case-by-case basis whether any conviction is relevant to suitability for the post and type of clearance for which the individual is applying. 

DfT, in carrying out checks as part of the NSV process, will consider both spent _and_ unspent convictions. It will also include police cautions and additional information held on local police records and considered to be relevant to the post and type of clearance for which the individual is applying.

Lists of relevant offences for the regulated transport industry were drawn up by DfT in consultation with industry and the police. Where appropriate, DfT may take into account offences other than those in these lists. More weight may be attached to one or more offences as an indicator of possible unsuitability where they are serious, repeated and recent.

Failure to declare criminal convictions on the security questionnaire may also give rise to serious concerns.

## Appeal procedures

The Cabinet Office outlines the appeals procedures for national security vetting (NSV):

  * [HMG Personnel Security Controls (PDF, 293 KB)](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/hmg-personnel-security-controls.pdf)

The Department for Transport (DfT) also operates a system by which an applicant may appeal for a Certificate of Disregard where they have a conviction which they feel should be disregarded for the purposes of issuing the necessary security clearance for the specified role. 

The procedure for applying for a Certificate of Disregard is as follows:

  * An applicant whose criminal record certificate has revealed one or more relevant convictions, and who wishes for their case to be considered by the DfT (acting in the name of the Secretary of State), shall provide DfT with information in support of their application for a Certificate of Disregard. The information shall include the valid criminal record certificate and any documentation available from the criminal trial that led to the conviction(s). It may also include a note from the pass applicant's solicitor, trade union or other representative. 

The documentation shall include a character reference, which may be from a sponsoring employer or any person or body that the applicant considers is relevant and is of suitable standing. If from an employer it should be from someone with direct management responsibility for the applicant and should state the date upon which the applicant commenced work for the employer or is due to commence work. The character reference should state

  * when the referee became aware of the pass applicant's conviction(s);
  * the referee's experience of the applicant in terms of his overall integrity, and
  * anything else which reflects upon the applicant's suitability to hold a level of national security vetting.

The application may contain any other information that the applicant considers relevant in demonstrating his or her good character before/since the conviction(s). It shall be submitted under cover of the form below.

  * [Application for a Department for Transport certificate to disregard a conviction (DOC, 31 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/personnel-security-nsv/application-for-a-dft-certificate-to-disregard-a-conviction.doc)

The applicant should forward the application and supporting documentation detailed in Step A, to:  
Vetting Team  
Department for Transport  
Zone 2/26  
Great Minster House  
33 Horseferry Road  
London  
SW1P 4DR

DfT will reach a view on whether the conviction(s) may be disregarded for the purposes of granting the security clearance. Convictions for offences that involve violence, dishonesty or abuse of trust are disqualifying offences as they can indicate that the individual may be vulnerable to pressure or improper influence or liable to commit a breach of security. DfT will consider the information supplied by the applicant and the relevant circumstances of the case, including (but not limited to) the age of the conviction(s) and its seriousness. DfT may need to request additional information from the applicant, such as more details about the conviction.

Where DfT does not require additional information from the pass applicant in order to determine an application, it will endeavour to issue a determination letter to the pass applicant within 28 days of the application to disregard a conviction(s) being received, or will contact the applicant within the 28 day period to inform the applicant as to when he or she can expect a reply. Notice of the decision will be given to the applicant. Where a decision is made that the disqualifying conviction may be disregarded, a Certificate of Disregard will be issued to the pass applicant. The Certificate of Disregard will state that the disqualifying conviction(s) may be permanently disregarded for the purposes of issuing a level of security clearance and confirm that the applicant has indeed received that clearance.

## Request for appointment of a counter-signatory

A counter-signatory is required for a directed party to pass responsibility for managing NSV applications to a contractor.

In April 2011 the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport announced a review into the problem of potholes. A progress report was published in December, and the final report is now available. The Review has considered how local highway authorities deal with potholes, as well as wider stakeholder views and implications. It makes 17 recommendations that will, if implemented, provide an improvement in highway maintenance and reduce the number of potholes occurring. There are three key messages in the report:

  * Prevention is better than cure;
  * Right first time for better repairs; and
  * Clarity for the public.

This survey-based research study was commissioned by the Department for Transport to provide evidence to inform its consideration of how to treat of business travel time savings in appraisal guidance. Its objective was to provide potential estimates of the use of travel time on trains by UK rail business travellers, together with and of the impact that journey time savings would have on their level of activity during the day and the value of these to both the employer and to the employee. As the report acknowledges, the research related only to current rail business travellers and current travel conditions, and longer term impacts are not considered in detail.

To further support local highway authorities in delivering casualty reduction targets locally, an annual £4million Road Safety Partnership Grant programme was launched at the end of October 2006, inviting bids from all local highway authorities in England.

The programme promotes a collaborative approach to all aspects of delivering enhanced road safety. In particular it aims to encourage partnerships between traditional road safety professionals and other service providers including the education sector, the health sector, the fire service, the youth service and the voluntary sector. It also hopes to stimulate road safety schemes which produce environmental and regeneration benefits.

This report provides a summary of outcomes and highlights the key learning points from the projects which benefited from the Road Safety Partnership Grant programme round two, which ran for up to two years from April 2008. It also provides brief summaries of those projects which were agreed in the following round, which are due to complete in March 2011.

The Air, Marine and Rail Accident Investigation Branches (AAIB, MAIB and RAIB) are stand-alone branches of the Department for Transport (DfT). Their general aims are to improve the safety of their respective sectors and to prevent accidents and incidents.

The three Accident Investigation Branches (AIBs) also fulfill the UK's duty under the respective EU Safety Directives to establish permanent bodies to undertake independent investigation of rail, maritime and air accidents. For all three Branches, the sole objective of investigating an accident is to determine its circumstances and causes, with the aims of improving safety and avoiding future accidents. It is not the purpose to apportion liability, nor to apportion blame.

As part of the ongoing evaluation of the Cycling City and Towns (CCT) programme, in-depth qualitative research was undertaken in 2010 with a sample of residents in the CCT programme areas to explore their experiences, attitudes and behaviours in relation to cycling and the cycling investment in their towns.

The research aimed to provide evidence to help interpret the findings of the post-intervention survey when the results are available in 2013. In the shorter term, it aims to contribute to our understanding of cycling behaviours and how people may best be encouraged to consider cycling as a viable transport option.

For more information on the CCT programme and its evaluation, please see the Department's pages concerning [evaluation of the Cycling City and Towns Programme](/publications/cycling-city-and-towns-programme).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/quiet-deliveries-demonstration-scheme,Quiet Deliveries Demonstration Scheme,Ways of allowing HGV vehicles to make quiet out of hours deliveries.,"HGV deliveries in residential areas are often constrained during night-time and/or weekend periods. However, this increases traffic and carbon emissions at peak hours. 

The Quiet Deliveries Demonstration Scheme (QDDS) scheme has investigated the types of constraint, the requirements for seeking a relaxation of delivery hours and the potential benefits of introducing quiet out-of-hours deliveries that do not create a disturbance to local residents.

  * What do TSIs contain?
  * What are ""Specific Cases""?

## What is a TSI?

A TSI is a common, harmonised, technical standard required to satisfy the essential requirements of interoperability which include safety, reliability and availability, health, environmental protection and technical compatibility.

Depending on their scope, TSIs may also contain other specific requirements relating to either ""structural"" subsystems (such as infrastructure, rolling stock, energy, and control/command and signalling) or ""functional"" subsystems (such as maintenance, traffic operation and management and telematics applications for passengers and freight services).     

TSIs are prepared by the European Railway Agency (""ERA"") under a mandate from the European Commission.  The mandate specifies the format which TSIs must conform to and the method that ERA must use to prepare them. 

## What is the role of TSIs

A Contracting Entity, which has responsibility for the management of any project, must ensure that the essential requirements of safety, reliability and availability, health, environmental protection and technical compatibility are met. ** **  
The application of TSIs removes the need for individual Contracting Entities to decide how the essential requirements should be met since they set out the means whereby, for the specific situations within their scope, these will be met.  TSIs also drive standardisation by mandating interfaces and assessment methodologies.  

The TSI framework is supplemented by [NNTRs](/topics/rail-interoperability-standards/common-technical-standards-for-rail-interoperability/notified-national-technical-rules) which, in respect of open (unresolved) points in the TSI, fulfill the role of defining how the essential requirements will be met.

## What is the status of TSIs?

TSIs are ""Decisions"" under European Community Law and have effect as if they were domestic regulations (secondary legislation).   As such they are binding on Member States, and because the Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011 make specific reference to TSIs and apply them for domestic purposes, their requirements are binding on the rail industry in the United Kingdom.

## How are TSIs developed?

TSIs are prepared by the European Railway Agency (""ERA"") under a mandate from the European Commission.  The mandate specifies the format of the TSI and the method that the ERA must use to prepare it.

Once a work programme is agreed, ERA establishes Drafting Group on which each National Safety Authority has a seat as well as experts from a number of relevant European Railway organisations.  The Group must prepare a document that matches the standard framework and content of a TSI.

Once the Drafting Group has completed its task, ERA sends the final draft to the European Commission, for consideration, amendment, and acceptance by the Railway Interoperability and Safety Committee (""RISC"").  Once ratified by a vote at RISC, and following subsequent approval by the Council and Parliament of the European Union, the European Commission issues the TSI as a Decision which then becomes binding upon Member States.

This process normally takes around three years and the Rail Safety and Standards Board has published [Guidance on TSI Development](http://www.rssb.co.uk/EUROPE/Pages/TSI.aspx) and an associated Checklist [link ""[checklist](http://www.rssb.co.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/rgs/005_Guidance_TSI_drafting_checklist_issue_2.pdf)"" .

## What do TSIs contain?

The structure and content of a TSI is prescribed in the Interoperability Directives and can be summarised as:** **

**Chapter 2** - establishes its scope; 

**Chapter 3** - specifies the essential requirements for the relevant subsystem; 

**Chapter 4** - lists the basic parameters of the subsystem necessary to meet the essential requirements and its interfaces with other subsystems.  It also specifies the functional and technical specifications which must be met and its interfaces to achieve specified performance; 

**Chapter 5** - determines the Interoperability Constituents and their interfaces necessary to achieve interoperability; 

**Chapter 6** - describes the procedures for assessing the conformity or suitability for use of Interoperability Constituents and for performing the EC Verification of the subsystem; and 

**Chapter 7** - describes the implementing provisions in certain specific cases, including recommendations regarding the time objectives for the transition from the existing to the final situation where there is full compliance with the TSIs (referred to as either an implementation plan or strategy).  This chapter frequently contains the answers sought by Contracting Entities and Notified Bodies to difficult compliance questions. 

## What are ""Specific Cases""?

Specific cases are provisions made in TSIs to deal with particular circumstances prevailing in a particular Member State.  For example, Great Britain has specific cases in the Infrastructure and Rolling Stock TSIs in relation to the structure gauge because our infrastructure is different to that found in mainland Europe.

Specific cases for all Member States are included in Chapter 7 of each TSI.** **

## How are errors in TSIs dealt with?

Errors in TSIs may be either ""critical"" or ""minor"" in scope.** **

An error in a TSI is **critical** if it:

  * prevents the completion of subsystem or interoperable constituent design; ** **
  * prevents the conformity assessment of the subsystem or the interoperable constituent; 
  * prevents the placing into service of the subsystem or the placing onto the market of the interoperable constituent; 
  * prevents the interoperability of the subsystem or the interoperable constituent 
  * contributes to unsafe operation not foreseen as part of the certification of the subsystem and / or the interoperable constituent; or 
  * contributes directly to an accident or incident. 

The European Commission has put in place a formal and ""rapid"" procedure for resolving critical errors.  If you think that your difficulties arise from one of the scenarios described, please email us at [interoperability@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:interoperability@dft.gsi.gov.uk) to explore whether this is the best route to pursue.

Where the error has arisen because a specification is impossible to apply in one Member State or in one specified (but generic) situation, then the European Commission can be petitioned for a Specific Case to be made and included in the TSI.  This is likely to be the device that is used to deal with some of the critical errors.

## Non-critical errors

Other errors are regarded as minor errors, and it is the Department's responsibility to resolve non-critical errors once they are brought to its attention.  As with critical errors, please email [interoperability@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:interoperability@dft.gsi.gov.uk) to discuss the problem. 

Minor errors are regarded as less urgent than critical errors and will be addressed in the routine review of the TSI.

The Rail Safety and Standards Board has established a log to capture information relating to problems which have been encountered during the application of TSIs in the United Kingdom at [www.rssb.co.uk/EUROPE/Pages/TSI.aspx](http://www.rssb.co.uk/EUROPE/Pages/TSI.aspx).

Published implementation plans for Technical Specifications for Interoperability (""TSIs"") in Great Britain.

One of the key elements of the strategy for interoperability is to create realistic and deliverable long-term implementation plans for each TSI.  It is envisaged that these will be developed in consultation with stakeholders and require Ministerial sign off.  They will be essential to:

  * understand and set out the business case for migration towards the widespread use of interoperability;
  * strategically plan for the development of the future network

The introduction of the European Railway Traffic Management System (""ERTMS"") is mandated by the Control, Command & Signalling TSI.  The system will progressively replace conventional signalling over the next 15 - 20 years.  A lot of the lineside structures and equipment that are part of our landscape will become redundant, and start to disappear, with trains instead being controlled by radio signals. 

The ERTMS implementation plan focuses on implementation of Global System for Mobile communications - Railway (GSM-R) and European Train Control System in support of the introduction of ERTMS Level 2 without lineside signals.  The plan aligns with expected re-signalling dates and rolling stock replacement dates wherever possible to produce the most cost-effective outcome.

ERTMS is essential if the rail system is to meet the needs of its customers in the twenty-first century.  It will mean that capacity usage of our crowded rail network can be optimised, maintenance costs should be reduced, fuel usage can be optimised thus reducing the carbon footprint, the equipment will be less vulnerable to local damage and vandalism, and signal sighting issues associated with conventional systems cease to be a problem.",guidance,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,,department-for-transport,background-to-rail-interoperability,,,21-Jul-2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an overview of the role of Notified Bodies (""NoBos"") which verify compliance with standards in the interoperability framework.

The design and construction of a new, renewed or upgraded railway subsystem must, under the [Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2006](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/397/contents/made)(RI), be verified by a NoBo as being compliant with applicable [Technical Specifications for Interoperability](/publications/rail-interoperability-tsi-catalogue) or [Notified National Technical Rules](/topics/rail-interoperability-standards/common-technical-standards-for-rail-interoperability/notified-national-technical-rules).

A NoBo must be appointed by a Contracting Entity before the completion of the design stage or before commencement of the manufacturing stage of a project, whichever is earlier.

  * [ Read an explanation of the NoBos role and how this fits into the broader interoperability framework (PDF 1024 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/interoperability/interoperability200.pdf)

NoBos are independent bodies assessed as meeting certain criteria under RIR, including competence, independence and integrity. In the United Kingdom, NoBos are appointed by the Secretary of State having considered advice from the [United Kingdom Accreditation Service](http://www.ukas.com) which also monitors their performance.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/rail-passenger-franchise-change-of-control,Rail franchise change of control policy statement,The Secretary of State's policy regarding requests for consent to changes of control under the terms of the relevant franchise agreement.,"From time to time, the Secretary of State is asked to approve changes of control of a franchisee. This note is a statement setting out the Secretary of State's policy when he receives requests for his consent to changes of control under the terms of the relevant franchise agreement.

## What is a change of control?

A change of control relates to a change in the identity of any person who ""controls"" the franchisee or franchise operator. ""Control"" for this purpose is defined in the franchise agreement. The definition contained in a recent franchise agreement is included at the appendix to this note.

## Why is it necessary to obtain the Secretary of State's consent to a change of control?

It is an Event of Default under the franchise agreement (for franchises on the new template it is paragraph 2.3 of Schedule 10.3) for a change to occur during the Franchise Term in the identity of any one person, or any two or more persons acting by agreement, who may Control the franchisee, without the consent of the Secretary of State. The prohibition is important because franchisees and franchise operators deliver front line public services. Rail franchises are vital to the government's delivery of its broader policy objectives on the environment, the economy, social inclusion and accessibility. Ensuring the continued success of a franchise is therefore a matter of legitimate public interest. All franchisees are vetted by the Secretary of State to ensure that they are financially robust and have a track record of successful delivery. The Secretary of State will wish to have confidence that the new owners will continue to honour their obligations under the franchise agreement and, as the success of a franchise is ultimately dependent on delivery by its people, in the quality of the proposed management team.

## What things are taken into account in considering whether to approve a change of control?

Except in the case of a change of control resulting from an intra-group restructuring, the Secretary of State will require a range of information from the prospective new owner. This will include the following:

### Financial and legal

  * copies of the acquiring company's group accounts for the past two years and any published interim accounts for the current or immediately preceding financial year;
  * details of the acquiring company's corporate structure;
  * copies of all constitutional documents of the acquiring company and its parents and any legislation under which it is incorporated.

### People

  * details of the proposed senior management team (including the board) which will be responsible for the franchise going forward, including details of their relevant experience and qualifications.

### Plans to honour franchise obligations

  * confirmation that the acquiring company has undertaken full due diligence in relation to the franchise and therefore understands the obligations it will be taking on in respect of that business;
  * a statement from the acquiring company of its intentions in relation to the performance of the existing franchisee's obligations under its franchise agreement and its plans for the long term future of the franchise;
  * details of any future plans in relation to the acquiring company or in relation to the group which may affect the franchise or the way in which the acquiring company conducts its business.

## Will the Secretary of State require anything else?

Yes, the Secretary of State will generally require the payment of a facilitation fee in consideration of the Secretary of State's consent, if granted, to all future changes of control of passenger rail franchises (where these do not result from intra-group restructurings). The fee will be levied on the person or persons in control of the franchisee or franchise operator before the change. The amount of the fee will generally be the greater of £1million or 5% of the value of the change of control of the franchise to the vendor. The proceeds will be invested in the passenger rail network. This fee is over and above the administration costs of processing an application for consent to a change of control. The administration fee shall be calculated by reference to the amount of time spent by officials on the proposed change of control and the Department's scale rates for different grades of staff as shall apply from time to time.

## On what basis is the Secretary of State requiring a facilitation fee?

The Secretary of State considers it appropriate to require payment of a facilitation fee because it is the reasonable expectation of the Secretary of State that a change of control represents a value to the vendor. The opportunity to realise that value is a product of the system of franchising established and maintained by Secretary of State at public expense, and the value of franchises is in many cases a product of substantial public subsidy. Therefore, the Secretary of State considers it appropriate that the public should also realise a benefit from a change of control. The Strategic Rail Authority, and prior to that the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, used to require a passenger dividend - agreed infrastructure or service investments - in consideration for consent to a change of control. Passenger dividends were in substance and effect similar to the facilitation fee which the Secretary of State is now seeking as consideration for his/her consent to the change of control and for reinvestment in the railway network.

As mentioned above, the fee will generally be the greater of £1million or 5% of the value of the change of control of the franchise to the seller. The Secretary of State considers that this basis of calculation strikes an appropriate balance between realising the full commercial value of the Secretary of State's consent for the benefit of the public and avoiding undue interference in the market. There are likely to be very few, if any, cases where the value of the Secretary of State's consent to the seller is less than £1m or where the imposition of a facilitation fee of £1m would constitute undue interference in the market.

Sellers will have the opportunity to make representations in relation to the facilitation fee when applying for the Secretary of State's consent to a change of control.

In order to assess the value of the change of control to the vendor of the relevant entity which currently has control of the franchisee or franchise operator, and to enable a proper assessment of the level of the facilitation fee to be made, the vendor will be required to provide the Secretary of State with such information and assistance as he may reasonably require.",policy-papers,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,,department-for-transport,background-to-rail-passenger-franchises,,,28-Mar-2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

### Invitation to Tender let since 2005

DfT Rail Procurement formerly had a settled policy to publish franchise Invitation to Tenders (ITTs) once the franchise has commenced and the Public Register Franchise Agreement (PRFA) has been agreed between the relevant Train Operating Company and DfT. Following a review of that policy, in future, subject to the application of any exemptions under the FOI Act (eg commercial prejudice), DfT Rail Procurement now intends to make ITTs publicly available at the same time as the ITT is disclosed to pre qualified bidders.

The current national Railway Byelaws were made in 2005 by Statutory Instrument under section 219 of the Transport Act 2000 in 2005. During September 2011, in accordance with section 46(5) of the Railways Act 2005, an amendment was made to the national Railway Byelaws.

The Amendment Order altered the definition of ""railway"""" in the national Railway Byelaws to remove from its scope all railway assets of Transport for London as well as trains, vehicles and any associated equipment which are for the time being used by a person for the purposes of providing railway services under an agreement with Transport for London, or any of its subsidiaries. It also removes the references to London Underground Limited and Tube Lines Limited from the list of excluded operators in Schedule 2 as the amendment to ""railway"" makes their inclusion in the Schedule superfluous.

This amendment allowed Transport for London to set its own byelaws covering such issues as a general alcohol ban on its network and also ensures that there will be a consistent approach to the application of byelaws where national rail and Transport for London services share stations and facilities.

An independent report of a study chaired by Sir Roy McNulty and commissioned by the Secretary of State for Transport. The report was jointly sponsored by DfT and ORR (Office of Rail Regulation) to examine the opportunities and barriers to improve the value for money of GB rail for taxpayers, passengers and freight customers.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/real-time-information-overview,Transport Direct real time information overview,Overview of Transport Direct real time information.,"From a traveller perspective, real-time information indicates whether a vehicle is going to be late or early, or whether the service is running at all.

Real-time information can be broadly divided into 3 categories:

a. How a vehicle is running through a network (eg a bus running along a bus route);

b. How a network is running and its effect on specific vehicles (eg a car being delayed due to heavy traffic on a section of road);

c. Travel news - how a network or combinations of networks are performing and what incidents are affecting operations.

'a' and 'b' will usually inform the traveller how many minutes a vehicle is running early/ late, while 'c' will usually give a broader picture about how an incident is affecting the network around it.

View the 2006 annual mapping survey results of RTI: This survey is based on information received from local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland in response to a questionnaire. It assesses the implementation and dissemination of Real Time Information (RTI) on buses, at stops and other locations and on other modes of transport at end-2006. It looks at the likely implementation and dissemination of future RTI systems by end-2007 and end-2008. It looks at the major issues which arose during implementations which had a major impact on timeliness, cost or functional delivery.

Contractor: Real time information group (RTIG).

Travellers should be able to find out, before starting their journey, how any part of their journey is performing in real-time. They should then be able to use this information to re-plan their trip, which allows them to make an informed decision on how they will travel.

Real Time Information should be provided to the traveller at any point where it will be the most useful. This involves using a mixture of different communication methods - typically electronic signs at stops, mobile devices and websites.

RTI should provide the user with:

  * information on delays before beginning their trip
  * the ability to journey plan using the latest information
  * alerts to problems on a pre-planned journey, and suggest alternatives

Overall, RTI should enable the traveller to make intelligent choices before or during their journey and provide them with all the information necessary to do this.

So far, Transport Direct has concentrated on the development of real-time information in the bus, rail and car sectors. In the future, Transport Direct is keen to see the development of high quality systems for all modes of transport.

Please see Transport Direct's [live travel news](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/LiveTravel/Home.aspx?cacheparam=0) section for available real time information.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/reducing-co2-emissions,Government response to the Committee on Climate Change report on reducing CO2 emissions from UK aviation to 2050,Additional evidence that will inform the debate on how the UK reduces carbon emissions from aviation in the most cost-effective way.,"In January 2009 the previous administration announced its intention to introduce a target to reduce CO2 emissions from UK aviation to below 2005 levels (37.5 MtCO2) by 2050. It asked the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to advise the government on how this target could be delivered. The CCC published its [report](http://www.theccc.org.uk/reports/aviation-report) on options for reducing UK aviation emissions to 2050 in December 2009 and last year the government made a Business Plan commitment to respond. 

The government's response to the CCC's report provides additional evidence that will inform the debate on how the UK reduces carbon emissions from aviation in the most cost-effective way. To support the response the Department for Transport has updated its [aviation passenger and CO2 emissions forecasts](/publications/uk-aviation-forecasts-2011/) and has undertaken an assessment of the relative cost-effectiveness and abatement potential of different measures for reducing UK aviation CO2 emissions out to 2050. 

In March 2011 the government published [Developing a sustainable framework for UK Aviation: Scoping document](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-09), starting a dialogue with stakeholders about delivering a long term aviation policy that will enable the UK to enjoy the benefits of aviation without paying an unacceptable environmental price. 

The government's response to the CCC and accompanying documents provide important additional evidence for stakeholders to consider when formulating their responses to the scoping document. Due to the delay to publication of this material, **we will accept responses to the scoping document until close of play on Thursday 20 October 2011, although earlier responses would be welcomed**.

If we receive a request for disclosure of the information we will take full account of your explanation, but we cannot give an assurance that confidentiality can be maintained in all circumstances. An automatic confidentiality disclaimer generated by your IT system will not, of itself, be regarded as binding on the Department. 

The Department will process your personal data in accordance with the DPA and in the majority of circumstances this will mean that your personal data will not be disclosed to third parties.

The Command Paper sets out the government's vision for the railways, alongside the policies that are needed to realise that vision. Making life better for customers - both passengers and freight users - is at the heart of our approach. We must also make the railways financially sustainable in the longer term, so they can contribute to the country's economic growth and environmental goals.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/register-street-works,Street works register,An internet based electronic data interchange for undertakers notifying highway authorities of street works in their area.,"## Summary

An Internet based electronic data interchange for undertakers notifying highway authorities of street works in their area. 

From April 2011 the current Data Capture Code list for use in the Street Works Register and Street Works Noticing process can be downloaded from the NSG website. GeoPlace has taken over responsibility for the administration, maintenance, allocation and hosting of the Streetworks Data Capture Code List. 

In bringing together the management of the NSG and SWA codes, GeoPlace can ensure the smooth running of the system. GeoPlace has put a number of procedures in place to manage the SWA code list, allocate new SWA codes and rationalise the codes of those organisations that no longer exists or statutory undertakers that have merged with each others. 

The list of SWA codes is now available to download from the [NSG website](http://www.thensg.org.uk/iansg/link.htm?nwid=20026) and will be updated on a monthly basis. An application for a code can be made by visiting the NSG website and completing the on-line form. SWA codes will only be allocated following a consultation with regulatory bodies such as OFGEM, OFWAT, the DfT, Companies House and HAUC UK. The Scottish Roadworks Commissioner has also requested that the same service is offered to Scotland and that the codes are aligned to create a common system across Great Britain.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/responsibilities-of-dft-transport-security-land-transport-division,Responsibilities of Transport Security's Land Transport Division,"Department for Transport is responsible for counter-terrorist security on the national rail network, London Underground and Channel Tunnel, and for the security of dangerous goods in transit.","Maritime and Land Transport Security Division (MLTS) of the Department for Transport is responsible for counter-terrorist security on the national rail network, London Underground and Channel Tunnel, and the security of dangerous goods in transit.

## Railways

  * The Department took the responsibility for setting and enforcing railway security standards on 22 February 2000, whilst Network Rail and the Train Operating companies (TOCS) continue to be responsible for the day to day delivery of security.
  * This brought the Railways into line with the Aviation, Maritime and Channel Tunnel sectors with the responsibility for setting standards, inspecting against them and taking necessary enforcement action to ensure compliance being undertaken by MLTS.
  * Security standards are set out in the National Railways Security Programme (NRSP). This document is issued to TOCS, Network Rail and others with direct involvement in railway security. The document details both mandatory and best practice standards for the industry.
  * Instructions served on the Rail sector were most recently updated in 2009.

## Underground and Light Rail Security

  * London Underground and the British Transport Police (BTP) have over 30 years of direct experience in dealing with terrorism. During this period, sound measures to deter the treat of terrorists have been devised and implemented successfully.
  * In July 2003 the Department used instructions to London Underground Ltd under the Railways Act 1993 to formalise the protective security measures already in place. These instructions came into force in October 2003 and currently subject to review.
  * A supporting London Underground Security Programme, developed in consultation with LUL and BTP, was issued in August 2003. This is also the subject of review.
  * London Underground Ltd continues to be responsible for the day to day delivery of security.
  * The Department acts as regulator: an inspection regime to monitor and enforce compliance has been established.
  * The wider review of rail security, following the Madrid attacks, recommended the security regime be extended to other underground, light rail and tram systems in the UK.
  * Regulatory security regimes are in place for DLR and Glasgow Subway; these are kept under constant review. The remaining 7 systems (Tyne & Wear Metro, Manchester Metrolink, Nottingham Tram, Sheffield Supertram, Croydon Tramlink and Blackpool Tram and the subject of recommended security best practice guidance which was issued in 2007.

## Channel Tunnel Security

  * The Treaty of Canterbury signed by the UK and France 1986 established the need for the defence of the Channel Fixed Link and this was incorporated into domestic legislation through the Channel Tunnel (Security) Order 1994.
  * The Order requires the operators of the Tunnel and any trains that transit it to apply counter-terrorist security measures.
  * Operators are responsible for the day to day delivery of security which includes amongst other measures the liability of vehicles, passengers, baggage and freight to be screened.
  * The Department's compliance officers ensure that the statutory security arrangements in place meet the statutory requirements and standards by regular monitoring and testing.
  * Security measures are closely tailored to the risk taking account of the threat as assessed by the government's security advisors, and the vulnerability of the system.
  * Security in France is the responsibility of the French government, but UK and French government officials meet regularly to ensure that comparability of security arrangements is maintained.

## Buses and coaches

  * The Department does not regulate the bus and coach sector for security.
  * Following requests for advice from operators in the wake of the July 2005 London bombings, it developed and issued guidance in October 2005 to the industry on best practice for the security of bus and coach operations. It is planned to issue refreshed guidance reflecting developments in the terrorist threat and associated security advice, later this year.
  * The measures are intended to prevent/deter acts of violence against buses and coaches, and to protect staff and passengers without impacting disproportionately on either the travelling public or the industry.
  * The refreshed guidance will offer operators a range of options ranging from basic measures to enhancements that they can draw on at times of heightened concern (eg if there is a bomb threat or the country moves to a higher level of threat).

## Channel Tunnel Services

### Eurotunnel (The Concessionaires)

  * Eurotunnel is the UK/French company, awarded the Concession to be responsible for the management and the security of the Tunnel and the terminals in both the UK and France (Cheriton and Coquelles respectively).
  * The company is also responsible for the security of the shuttle train services which carry road vehicles between the two terminals.
  * Eurotunnel operates two types of shuttle train services, one for passenger vehicles (including cars, coaches and motor cycles) and the other for lorry-borne freight.
  * A security regime is in place for screening vehicles, whether carrying freight or passengers.
  * The company undertakes all the statutory security activities in the UK but in France some of the functions are undertaken by the Douanes (the French Customs authority), however security arrangements are comparable.

### Eurostar International Ltd

  * Eurostar is the only international rail passenger operator running services between London St Pancras, Ebbsfleet and Ashford to Paris and Brussels via Lille.
  * Eurostar is responsible for the security of the trains and the stations it operates from in the UK and ensures that passengers and their baggage are security screened prior to departure.
  * Security measures deployed in France and Belgium are comparable with those in the UK.

### Proposed Deutsche Bahn (DB) Passenger Rail Services

  * DB has announced that it will operate services between London and Frankfurt and Amsterdam from December 2015.
  * As owners of the Channel Tunnel the UK and France are working with DB to ensure that comparable security measures to those in the UK, France and Belgium are put in place in Germany and the Netherlands in advance of the service commencing.

### International Rail Freight

  * Rail borne freight is transported through the Channel Tunnel by the freight operator DB Schenker (formerly English, Welsh and Scottish International (EWSI)).
  * Freight from consignors which are registered with the Department for Transport as Security Approved Channel Tunnel Freight Forwarders (SACTFF) including Approved Freight Service Operators (AFSO) who certify the security integrity of their loads and apply seals to the containers and wagons are considered known freight.
  * Freight from all other consignors is considered unknown freight.
  * All freight is subject to security checks on arrival at Department for Transport approved freight terminals. The level of those security checks will vary dependent on whether the freight is known or unknown.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/road-classification-guidance,Guidance on Road Classification and the Primary Route Network,The central government will hand over greater responsibility to local highway authorities for the management of the roads classification system.,"## Summary

The classification of Britain's roads dates back to the 1920s, when it had become clear that it was necessary to have a system to help motorists identify good routes for driving. In the 1960s, the existing system was overhauled to help deal with an age of mass-motoring.

From April 2012, central government will be handing over greater responsibility to local highway authorities for the management of the roads classification system. While authorities had previously done the majority of the work involved in reclassifying a road, they always needed to secure the agreement of the Department for Transport. Under the new approach, authorities are allowed to exercise this power without the need for central approval.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/road-pricing-demonstrations-project,Road pricing demonstrations project - introduction,"A technical research project designed to establish how any system of road pricing by time, distance and place could operate reliably, accurately and affordably, whilst safeguarding privacy.","## Demonstrations Project on time, distance, place (TDP) road user charging1

The Demonstrations Project was a technical research project designed to establish how any system of road pricing by time, distance and place (TDP) could operate reliably, accurately and affordably, whilst safeguarding privacy. The project did not seek to address the wider merits or otherwise of road pricing. 

At the time of the Project's inception in 2007 under the previous administration, most existing road pricing or charging systems worked on the basis of a single event, ie paying a toll to use a road, bridge or tunnel, or for driving within a certain area such as the London Congestion Charge zone. This Project set out to test whether technology existed to target congestion more effectively, by where it occurs and when. To do this in a fair and effective way required more advanced technology and systems than were then being used in the UK, and these needed to be rigorously tested before any conclusions could be drawn. 

The Coalition government has ruled out national road pricing for cars on existing roads, and any preparation for such a scheme, for the duration of this Parliament. 

## Background to the Demonstrations Project

In May 2007, the Department announced that it would work with industry to establish how road pricing by time, distance and place (TDP) might operate reliably, accurately and affordably, whilst safeguarding privacy. To facilitate this it set up the Demonstrations Project. 

In September 2008, the Department confirmed in the Official Journal of the European Union the names of the four companies selected to participate in the Demonstrations Project following an open competition - Intelligent Mechatronic Systems (UK), Sanef Tolling Limited, T-Systems Ltd and Trafficmaster plc. Each of these contractors engaged 100 volunteer road users to help explore questions of privacy, accuracy and practicability. 

A further three companies - Kapsch TrafficCom Limited, Q-Free ASA and Serco Ltd - were appointed to develop the systems necessary for both road users and the operators of a scheme to be confident that it was operating fairly. 

The key finding from the project is that commercially-run time, distance place charging systems (along with an associated payment regime) can deliver accuracy, privacy and a trusted service. Further findings and explanation are contained in the Project's main report **'Road Pricing Demonstrations Project - Key Learnings: Main Report'** and supporting documentation listed below.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/road-vehicle-emission-factors-2009,Road vehicle emission factors 2009,TRL prepared mathematical formulae that relate the rate of emission of a pollutant and fuel consumption to average vehicle speed. The new emission factors,"The current emission factors for road transport have not been revised for a number of years. During this time several new exhaust emission regulations have taken effect, and at the request of the Department for Transport (DfT), TRL has revised the emission factors to reflect these changes.

The purpose of the revision is to enable emissions from road transport to be modelled more accurately through the addition of the latest vehicle emission test data from the DfT's own emissions test programmes and other EU projects.

To ensure that all stakeholders' views on the revised factors have been taken into account before the new factors are published, the DfT published a public consultation on its website on 4 August 2008 that was sent either electronically or in paper form to more than 400 stakeholders. The consultation ran for 12 weeks, and closed on 24 October 2008.

  * [Consultation and a summary of the consultation responses](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081230052355/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/consultvehicleemission/)

## New emission factors

TRL prepared mathematical formulae that relate the rate of emission of a pollutant and fuel consumption to average vehicle speed. The new emission factors incorporate the latest test data on vehicles meeting the new vehicle Euro emission standards, the formulae also address published future standards. In preparing the formulae, TRL addressed concerns raised in the public consultation.

The formulae will be used to model road transport's contribution to national and local air quality.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/rswp24-feasibility-phase-1,Motorcycle manoeuvres review: the feasibility and safety implications - phase 1,A study assessing the feasibility and safety of carrying out a revised set of manoeuvres for the motorcycle test.,"## Summary

In June 2010, the Road Safety Minister announced a review of the practical motorcycle test, with the aim of devising a single-event test that is carried out on the road as far as possible. This study assesses the feasibility and safety of carrying out a revised set of manoeuvres for the motorcycle test. In this first phase of the research, off-road locations were 'mocked-up' to resemble real roads in terms of marking the centre line and the edges of the carriageway. On this mock-road area, 'test ready' learner riders rode through the revised set of manoeuvres being proposed for potential on-road use, and through the existing module 1 manoeuvres on a separate layout. In this way it was possible to draw direct comparisons between the two sets of manoeuvres.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/rtfo-guidance,RTFO guidance,How biofuel suppliers should prepare their monthly reports,"## The guidance

The RTFO Guidance provides support for fuel suppliers, independent verifiers and others involved in the supply of biofuels for use in road transport in the UK.

The guidance is divided into three parts.

## Part 1: process guidance

This provides information on how fossil fuel and renewable transport fuel suppliers should comply with the RTFO Order and practical instruction on how they should submit the required information to the Administrator. It provides detailed instructions and information on:

  * The obligation that the RTFO Order puts on certain fuel suppliers
  * Applying for and maintaining an account with the RTFO Administrator
  * Applying for Renewable Transport Fuels Certificates (RTFCs)
  * Penalties for non-compliance. 

## Part 2: carbon & sustainability guidance

This aims to provide assistance on carbon and sustainability (C&S) reporting for fossil fuel and renewable transport fuel suppliers that wish to benefit from receiving Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). It clarifies sustainability criteria for biofuels supplied under the RTFO and how to demonstrate compliance. It provides detailed information on:

  * Reporting carbon and sustainability data
  * Demonstrating compliance with greenhouse gas and land use criteria
  * Mass balance rules
  * Wastes and residues

## Part 3: guidance for verifiers

All carbon and sustainability data associated with biofuels must be verified by an independent third party before Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates will be awarded for those fuels. The Guidance for Verifiers outlines the approach to this process.  
It includes detailed information on: 

  * The purpose and requirements of verification
  * Planning and risk assessment 
  * Developing an assurance strategy
  * Reporting and assurance statements 

## Key changes

The publication of this guidance follows the implementation of the transport elements of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) on December 15, 2011 and therefore includes a number of significant differences to those versions published prior to that date. These include guidance on:

  * The introduction of mandatory sustainability criteria for biofuels, including a minimum GHG saving
  * Double rewards to incentivise certain types of biofuels, such as those made from wastes
  * A requirement for suppliers to have carbon and sustainability data for their fuels independently verified before Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates are awarded

## Supplementary guidance for small suppliers of used cooking oil biodiesel

This supplementary guidance is primarily intended for use by smaller suppliers of Biofuels who have previously not had to verify the carbon sustainability (C&S) of the data associated with their biofuel. This verification process is now a requirement in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). It should be noted however, that this guidance is not intended to replace the full RTFO guidance (Parts 1-3) but to provide an overview of the requirements under the new scheme, particularly for those suppliers who are unfamiliar with the new requirements.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/rtfo-supplier-sustainability-reports,RTFO supplier sustainability reports,"Obligated fossil fuel suppliers and biofuel suppliers supplying more than 450,000 litres of fuel for use in road transport in the UK were required to submit reports on the sustainability of their biofuels for the period 2010/11.","## Summary

Any fuel supplier supplying more than 450,000 litres of biofuel for use in road transport in the UK were required to submit verified reports on the sustainability of their biofuels for the period 2010/11.

These reports include a summary of biofuels supplied and their performance against the voluntary sustainability standards which were in place during this period, as well as any further activity outside the immediate scope of these targets which suppliers may have undertaken to ensure the sustainability of their biofuels.

The suppliers were required to engage independent verifiers to provide limited assurance that the information supplied was accurate. The assurance statements accompany the reports, either embedded as part of the reports themselves, or as separate documents published alongside the supplier's report.

One obligated supplier, Valero, made a number of errors in its report, predominantly when calculating the weighted averages for the performance of its fuels. The company was given the opportunity to correct these errors but did not do so. Corrected figures produced by the RTFO Administrator have been published alongside the company's report as a spreadsheet.

Supplier reports from previous years are available on the archived website of the Renewable Fuels Agency.

  * [2008/09 Supplier reports](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.renewablefuelsagency.gov.uk/reportsandpublications/yearoneofthertfo/supplierannualreports2008-09)
  * [2009/10 Supplier reports](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.renewablefuelsagency.gov.uk/reportsandpublications/yeartwoofthertfo/supplierannualreports2009-10)

The amendment of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (RTFO) Order in December 2011 removed voluntary targets and added the mandatory sustainability criteria of the European Renewable Energy Directive (RED).

This will mean changes to the way fuel companies are expected to report to the RTFO Administrator in future years.

The independently verified data on supply of biofuels to the UK under the RTFO during the period covered by these reports is also available on the Department's website:

## Exemption Orders for Heavy Rail Vehicles

The introduction of new European legislation in 2008 means that heavy rail vehicles (trains used on Network Rail infrastructure) are no longer subject to the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (""RVAR"") 2010.

However, a number of heavy rail vehicles introduced under the RVAR regime between January 1999 and August 2006 were granted exemption orders and these are listed below alphabetically by the name of the vehicle operator at the time (which may have since changed). Please see ""[Rail Vehicles](/topics/access/rail/rail-vehicles)"" for more information about what is happening to these exemptions.

Where available, a link to the associated Explanatory Memoranda, which include details on the reasons why exemptions are necessary, consultation and other related information, has also been included.

This Circular provides advice to local planning authorities in England and Wales regarding the safeguarding of aerodromes, technical sites and military explosives storage areas.","## Introduction 

1. In connection with the transfer by the Civil Aviation Authority, as the regulator, of primary responsibility for the official safeguarding of civil aerodromes and technical sites from itself to the operators of the aerodromes and the technical sites, it has been decided to cancel the Town and Country Planning (Aerodromes and Technical Sites) Direction 1992, which was issued with Department of the Environment Circular 2/92 (Welsh Office Circular 5/92) and to issue in its place an updated Direction.

2. The Town and Country Planning (Safeguarded Aerodromes, Technical Sites and Military Explosives Storage Areas) Direction 2002, which is reproduced at Annex 1 of this Circular and which comes into effect on 10 February 2003, applies to military explosives storage areas in addition to aerodromes and technical sites.

3. Annex 2 of the Circular provides details of the system of safeguarding; Annex 3 lists the civil aerodromes which are officially safeguarded; and Annex 4 lists the local planning authority areas containing civil en-route technical sites for which separate official safeguarding maps have been issued. A list of these civil en-route technical sites can be obtained from the NATS Group Property Department. A list of the currently safeguarded military aerodromes, technical sites and explosives storage areas can be obtained from Defence Estates.

## Annex 2: Arrangements for Safeguarding Aerodromes, Technical Sites and Military Explosives Storage Areas International and National Aviation Background

1. Civil aerodromes are licensed in order to ensure that certain types of flights, essentially those for the transport of fare-paying passengers and those for flying training, use only those aerodromes which provide a range of facilities in accordance with internationally agreed safety criteria. These criteria are set out in Annex 14 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944 (The Chicago Convention). The Civil Aviation Authority has developed its own licensing guidance document, Civil Aviation Publication (CAP) 168, Licensing of Aerodromes, which amplifies Annex 14 to the Convention. 

2. In domestic legislation civil aerodromes are licensed under an Air Navigation Order made under section 60 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. The Civil Aviation Authority is responsible under the Air Navigation Order for being satisfied that a licensed aerodrome is safe for use by aircraft, having regard in particular to the physical characteristics of the aerodrome and its surroundings. This is a continuing responsibility, which it discharges by means of regular audits, by placing obligations on the licensee to inform it when material changes take place and by ensuring that proposed developments are assessed. In addition a requirement is placed on the licensee to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the aerodrome and its surrounding airspace are safe at all times for use by aircraft. 

Officially Safeguarded Civil or Military Aerodromes and Technical Sites

3. Certain civil aerodromes, selected on the basis of their importance to the national air transport system, are therefore officially safeguarded, in order to ensure that their operation and development are not inhibited by buildings, structures, erections or works which infringe protected surfaces, obscure runway approach lights or have the potential to impair the performance of aerodrome navigation aids, radio aids or telecommunication systems; by lighting which has the potential to distract pilots; or by developments which have the potential to increase the number of birds or the bird hazard risk. A similar official safeguarding system applies to certain military aerodromes, selected on the basis of their strategic importance. In order to determine the safety implications of a planning application for a development within the approach, take-off or circuit areas of an aerodrome, a safeguarding process is established with all the relevant local planning authorities. Because the safety of aircraft in United Kingdom airspace is often dependent on ground-based navigation and radio aids, certain civil technical sites currently owned by NATS Holdings Ltd or its subsidiaries and certain military technical sites owned by the Secretary of State for Defence are also officially safeguarded under a similar process. 

4. A list of the currently officially safeguarded civil aerodromes referred to in the previous paragraph is set out in Annex 3. A list of the local planning authority areas containing civil en-route technical sites for which separate official safeguarding maps have been issued is set out in Annex 4. A list of the currently safeguarded civil technical sites can be obtained from the NATS Group Property Department at One Kemble Street, London WC2B 4AP. A list of the currently safeguarded military aerodromes, technical sites and explosives storage areas can be obtained from Defence Estates at the address given in paragraph 35.

Safeguarding Maps: Buildings, Structures, Erections and Works

5. A site-specific safeguarding map is centred on the safeguarded aerodrome or technical site and shows colour-coded areas which in total equate to the extent of the safeguarded area. In the case of civil aerodromes the colour-coded areas are principally derived from a series of protected surfaces above and around the aerodrome which are defined in Annex 14 to the Chicago Convention and the Civil Aviation Authority's licensing guidance document CAP168. Their purpose is to indicate to a local planning authority those types of development upon which consultation is required. It is required if the height of any building, structure, erection or works would, as a result of the development, exceed the level indicated on the map for the relevant colour-coded area, in cases where the local planning authority are considering an application for full or outline planning permission, an application for the amendment of an outline planning permission, an application for the renewal of a planning permission or an application for the removal or modification of conditions imposed on a previous planning permission. The requirements for such consultation are described in the legend on the safeguarding map.

6. The importance of the consultation which the safeguarding process involves does not in practice relate solely to the height of buildings, structures, erections or works. Aerodrome operators employ a variety of navigational aids, radio aids and telecommunication systems in order to facilitate air traffic control and aircraft movements. In addition, at night or in low visibility conditions such as fog, pilots rely on approach and runway lighting to align themselves with the runway and to touch down at the correct point. A building or structure can, because of its size, shape, location or construction materials, act as a reflector or diffractor of the radio signals on which navigational aids, radio aids and telecommunication systems depend, while almost any development in the vicinity of these aids and systems has the potential to interfere with them. The colour coding on the safeguarding map is therefore designed to ensure that local planning authorities consult the relevant consultee on any proposed development in the vicinity of an aerodrome which has the potential to interfere with the operation of its navigational aids, radio aids and telecommunication systems. In addition the lighting elements of a development have the potential to distract or confuse pilots, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the aerodrome and of the aircraft approach paths. Any safeguarding assessment will therefore need to consider the impact of lighting proposals. Road lighting is referred to in more detail in paragraph 12.

Aerodrome Safeguarding Maps: ""Birdstrike"" Hazard

7. Birdstrikes are one of the major controllable hazards to aviation. Common birds have caused catastrophic accidents to all types of aircraft. Most birdstrikes occur on or near aerodromes but, because birds are very mobile, features far beyond an aerodrome boundary may increase the hazard. If a man-made development provides feeding, roosting or breeding opportunities, or shelter and security, it may, depending on the siting of the development and the species which it attracts, increase the number of birds visiting or overflying an aerodrome or the number of birds in the airspace used by aircraft. Gulls and starlings congregate in very large overnight roosts and travel long distances daily, while waterfowl are large and often fly in close formation. There is only limited scope for taking action on aerodromes to counter these hazards, and safeguarding may be the only effective means of reducing the risk to aircraft in flight.

8. The primary aim is to guard against new or increased hazards caused by development. The most important types of development in this respect are: facilities intended for the handling, compaction, treatment or disposal of household or commercial wastes, which attract a variety of species, including gulls, starlings, lapwings and corvids; the creation or modification of areas of water such as reservoirs, lakes, ponds, wetlands and marshes, which attract gulls and waterfowl; nature reserves and bird sanctuaries; and sewage disposal and treatment plant and outfalls, which can attract gulls and other species. Planting trees and bushes normally creates a bird hazard only when it takes place relatively near to an aerodrome, but a potential starling roost site further away from an aerodrome can create a hazard. Mineral extraction and quarrying can also create a bird hazard because, although these processes do not in themselves attract birds, the sites are commonly used for landfill or the creation of wetland.

9. In order to protect aerodromes against these hazards, safeguarding maps include, in addition to the requirements related to the height of buildings and structures, a dotted circle, with a 13 kilometre radius in the case of civil aerodromes and an eight mile (about 12.87 kilometre) radius in the case of military aerodromes, centred on the safeguarded aerodrome reference point to indicate the area within which developments likely to attract birds require similar consultation. Local planning authorities are required to consult the relevant consultee before granting planning permission for any development within the relevant radius of an officially safeguarded civil or military aerodrome which is likely to attract birds. Whether or not a development is likely to attract birds will depend on a number of factors. A local planning authority will need to consider not only the individual potential bird attractant features of a proposed development but also whether the development, when combined with existing land features, will make the safeguarded area, or parts of it, more attractive to birds or create a hazard such as bird flightlines across aircraft flightpaths.

Aerodrome Safeguarding Maps: Other Aviation Uses

10. In order to protect aerodromes against the hazards which would arise from other aviation uses, the 13 kilometre or eight mile radius dotted circle referred to in paragraph 9 is also relevant to these uses. Local planning authorities are required to consult the relevant consultee before granting any application connected with an aviation use within a 13 kilometre radius of an officially safeguarded civil aerodrome or within an eight mile radius of an officially safeguarded military aerodrome. Examples of applications connected with an aviation use include applications for development at an existing aerodrome and applications for the use of a site other than an aerodrome for the purposes of flight or as a drop zone for parachuting. Article 129 of the Air Navigation Order 2000 defines flight.

Roads and Railways Near Safeguarded Aerodromes

11. Road and rail vehicles are potential obstructions to aircraft. The internationally agreed safety criteria recognise this by considering a road to be a mobile obstruction of 4.8 metres and a railway to be a mobile obstruction of 5.4 metres. The Civil Aviation Authority has adopted these provisions as part of its safeguarding practice. If a road or a railway forms part of a planning application, the local planning authority should regard it as development of a height of 4.8 or 5.4 metres, as the case may be, and consult in accordance with the colour coding on the safeguarding map. Lighting columns and other street furniture, and signal gantries and power lines, should also be the subject of consultation appropriate to their height, in accordance with the colour coding on the safeguarding maps. In the case of safeguarded military aerodromes local planning authorities are asked to consult the Secretary of State for Defence about any proposal to build a new road, or to upgrade an existing road, which is planned to run within 300 metres of the perimeter of the aerodrome. The extension of this provision to a wider area in the case of military aerodromes takes into account the presence of explosives storage areas on certain military aerodromes.

12. Local planning authorities should pay particular attention to the intensity and alignment of road lighting, which is a matter of concern over much more than the areas close to the ends of a runway. The intensity of lighting can distract pilots by causing glare in the direction of an approaching aircraft while, when viewed from the air, a road lighting scheme which makes a pattern similar to an approach or runway lighting pattern can confuse pilots who use those lights when landing at night or in foggy conditions. British Standard 5489, Part 8, states that the area within which a road lighting scheme may affect the safe use of an aerodrome is 4.8 kilometres beyond the aerodrome boundary. Local planning authorities should take account of the possibility that road lighting can be a safeguarding issue within this area.

Other Civil Aerodromes

13. Operators of licensed aerodromes which are not officially safeguarded, and operators of unlicensed aerodromes and sites for other aviation activities (for example gliding or parachuting) should take steps to protect their locations from the effects of possible adverse development by establishing an agreed consultation procedure between themselves and the local planning authority or authorities. One method, recommended by the Civil Aviation Authority to aerodrome licensees, is to lodge a non-official safeguarding map with the local planning authority or authorities. Local planning authorities are asked to respond sympathetically to requests for non-official safeguarding. The general advice in this Annex is applicable to non-officially as well as to officially safeguarded aerodromes, but the requirements of the Direction at Annex 1 will not apply. The Civil Aviation Authority is prepared to offer advice on the preparation of a non-official safeguarding map at the request of any aerodrome operator or local planning authority.

Technical Sites

14. All airport-related technical sites are located within the areas of the respective aerodrome safeguarding maps. In the case of an officially safeguarded civil en-route technical site that lies within an area which is also covered by aerodrome safeguarding requirements, a local planning authority need to refer both to an aerodrome and to a technical site safeguarding map and to carry out separate consultations as required by those maps. Where a military technical site is located on a military aerodrome the safeguarding criteria are included on the aerodrome safeguarding map. A single site-specific map is issued for each of the other military technical sites, showing colour-coded areas which in total equate to the extent of the safeguarded area and indicating which types of planning application are to be the subject of consultation.

Wind Turbine Development

15. The safeguarding requirements for the civil aerodromes listed at Annex 3 and for officially safeguarded civil en-route technical sites are completed by separate maps showing circles with a 30 kilometre radius centred on the aerodrome reference point or technical site to indicate the area within which a proposed wind turbine development requires consultation. The issue of these maps recognises the fact that the introduction of wind powered generator turbines within the United Kingdom as part of an alternative energy policy can create certain problems for aviation. In addition to their potential for presenting a physical obstacle to air navigation, wind generator turbines can affect signals radiated from and received by aeronautical systems. The rotating blades create electromagnetic disturbance, which can degrade the performance of these systems and cause incorrect information to be received. The amount of interference depends on the number of wind turbines, on a wind turbine's size, construction materials and location and on the shape of its blades. Local planning authorities, consultees, developers and others may wish to refer to Wind Energy and Aviation Interests - Interim Guidelines, published by the Department of Trade and Industry in 2002.

Officially Safeguarded Military Explosives Storage Areas

16. The Secretary of State for Defence safeguards military explosives storage areas. The safeguarding criteria for many of these areas are included on military aerodrome safeguarding maps. Site-specific explosives safeguarding plans have been issued for other sites where military explosives are stored or handled. These plans show the areas adjacent to a Potential Explosion Site where restrictions are imposed: within a yellow arc people may not remain for long periods of time, while within a purple arc new buildings which might be of vulnerable construction may not be built. There has hitherto been no general Direction as for aerodromes and technical sites but the Direction at Annex 1 now incorporates a general Direction in respect of military explosives storage areas; explosives safeguarding plans are to be treated as safeguarding maps.

17. These arrangements should not be confused with the arrangements for consulting the Health and Safety Executive about proposals for development around licensed explosives factories and magazines. Local planning authorities were advised of these consultation arrangements in a letter of 12 October 2000 from the Explosives Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive.

Safeguarding Procedure

18. Safeguarding maps for civil aerodromes and technical sites are certified by the Civil Aviation Authority. Safeguarding maps for military aerodromes, technical sites and explosives storage areas are certified by the Secretary of State for Defence. A safeguarding map is issued to each local planning authority within the area indicated on the map. The requirements for consultation are described in the legend on the safeguarding map. In respect of any officially safeguarded civil aerodrome or civil en-route technical site, there will be two safeguarding maps. But as the maps relating to wind turbine development cover larger areas than the general aerodrome safeguarding maps and larger areas than some of the general technical site safeguarding maps, some local planning authorities will need to consult civil aerodrome or technical site operators only in connection with proposed wind turbine development.

19. It is recognised as good practice for applicants to initiate technical consultations before submitting planning applications, and it is open to them to send details of a proposed development direct to a statutory consultee. Local planning authorities which are themselves consulted before a planning application is submitted should encourage the applicant to consult the relevant consultee if this has not already been done. It is likely to be necessary for local planning authorities to ask an applicant for any of the types of development listed in paragraph 8 to show by means of a risk assessment that a proposed development would not be likely to increase the number of birds or the bird hazard risk to aircraft.

20. Consultees may face particular difficulty in providing advice in respect of outline planning applications, because they are likely to need to examine specific proposals on matters such as siting, design (including height) and external appearance before they can advise on whether the proposed development might compromise the safe operation of the aerodrome or interfere with the navigation aid. In considering outline planning applications local planning authorities should therefore take account of the importance to consultees of what could otherwise be reserved matters. Article 3(2) of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 provides that, where a local planning authority consider that an application for outline planning permission ought not to be considered separately from all or any reserved matters, they must notify the applicant within one month of receiving the application that they are unable to determine the application unless further specific details are submitted.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/scope-of-rail-interoperability,Scope of rail interoperability,The scope and applicability of the interoperability  regime in Great Britain.,"## Outline

This is an outline of the scope and applicability of the interoperability regime in the UK under the [Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011 (RIR 2011)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/3066/contents/made). A helpnote on this subject with more detailed information will be published shortly.

The regulations apply to work on new, upgraded or renewed structural subsystems (vehicles and infrastructure) on the parts of the rail system located in the United kingdom, except for certain categories of lines that are excluded from the scope of the regulations.

Their scope is not limited to the UK part of the Trans European Network (TEN), so those parts both on and off TEN are within scope, unless they fall under the exclusion categories (see below).

Projects within scope of the regulations will require an authorisation to place into service for new, upgraded or renewed structural subsystems. Projects will be assessed against relevant Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) and notified national technical rules. The current applicability of TSIs is limited to the TEN as contained in [Decision 661/2010/EU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:204:FULL:EN:PDF) (which recasts the original Decision 1692/96/EC). Article 10 describes the characteristics of the TEN rail network (high-speed and conventional rail networks).

The Department has published an [approved list of exclusions under RIR 2011](/publications/exclusions-interoperability/). The exclusions cover the following categories:

  * metros, trams and other light rail systems;
  * networks that are functionally separate from the rest of the rail system and intended only for the operation of local, urban or suburban passenger services, as well as railway undertakings operating solely on these networks;
  * infrastructure and vehicles reserved for a strictly local, historical or touristic use.

There are also the following ""blanket exemptions"" from the scope of the regulations:

  * privately owned railway infrastructure and vehicles exclusively used on such infrastructure that exist solely for use by the owner for its freight operations; or
  * railways the lines of which have a gauge of less than 350 millimetres and vehicles running on such lines.

Applicants may seek changes to the approved list of exclusions by contacting the Department at: [interoperability@dft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:interoperability@dft.gsi.gov.uk)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/secure-station-scheme-guidelines,Secure Stations Scheme guidelines,The Secure Stations Scheme represents a national standard for passenger safety and security on Britain's railway stations.,"## Introduction to the Secure Stations Scheme

The Secure Stations Scheme represents a national standard for passenger safety and security on Britain's railway stations. Launched in 1998, the Scheme was independently reviewed in 2003 and subsequently revised in order to simplify some procedures and encourage more operators to take part.

These resource materials have been prepared to assist operators in making improvements to stations for the security of staff and passengers. They contain information which may be useful in improving the physical environment and management of any station - from a busy, major, urban interchange to one in a small, quiet, rural community.

For stations that fall short of the Scheme's accreditation standard there is a new category of 'working towards accreditation'. This category recognises the efforts that are being made by some operators to get such stations to meet the standard, and provides them with the guidance and support to do so.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/security-related-conduct-and-behaviour-issues-in-terms-and-conditions-of-employment,Guidance for transport employers on including security-related conduct and behaviour issues in terms and conditions of employment,Ensuring that conduct and behaviour which could constitute a security concern is adequately accounted for in terms and conditions of employment.,"## Purpose of this guidance

This guidance is intended for use by employers to ensure that conduct and behaviour which could constitute a security concern is adequately accounted for in terms and conditions of employment. 

Security concerns form just one aspect of terms and conditions of employment and this document is intended to support existing general and statutory guidance, such as that produced by the government and by ACAS **1** , and not as a replacement for it.

In drawing up such terms and conditions of employment the company should take advice from those responsible for security to ensure that security issues relevant to the company, and to individual roles within it, are properly taken into account. Discussion of terms and conditions of employment should also involve employees and their representatives.

**Why is it important for employers to account for security concerns in their terms and conditions of employment?**

An important implied term in every employment contract is the duty of mutual trust and confidence, which means that employers and employees must not act in a way which unreasonably and seriously damages their relationship. For example, employees are trusted not to destroy company property, and employers are trusted to follow fair contractual procedures before taking any disciplinary action against an employee. Many security concerns relate to honesty and integrity and fall within this implied contractual obligation.

Employers should be aware that an employee may be able to:

  * divert their company or customer funds or other assets;
  * physically or electronically sabotage their operations;
  * allow others to access their facilities, vehicles and premises;
  * disclose their valuable information without authorisation or control; or
  * appropriate their intellectual property.

with the possible consequence of:

  * making terrorist attacks possible;
  * stealing their physical, intellectual or financial assets;
  * directly or indirectly benefitting their competitors;
  * lowering staff morale and commitment;
  * sending their customers elsewhere;
  * damaging their company reputation; and
  * leaving them open to claims of negligence.

For transparency, it is important that employers inform their employees about any rules relating to security concerns, and to any changes in those rules, so that employees understand:

  * what behaviour would be deemed unacceptable;
  * the processes for investigating evidence of such behaviour; and
  * the consequences if they are found to have breached these rules. 

This ensures that employers, employees and their representatives have a shared understanding of what is expected of employees, and the action that may be taken if those expectations are not met.

**What constitutes a security concern?**

Employers should consult those responsible for security within the organisation to help them determine what would constitute a security concern, and which may result in the employer taking disciplinary action. Relevant concerns may include, but are not limited to:

  * unauthorised disclosure of sensitive information or intellectual property;
  * fraud;
  * theft of physical, intellectual or financial assets;
  * financial misconduct;
  * violent behaviour;
  * membership of or support for groups which advocate violence;
  * damage to property;
  * facilitating any of the above; and
  * breaches of company security requirements.

Relevant concerns should be made clear to an employee, both through terms and conditions of employment and/or Staff Handbooks, with those messages reinforced in any induction programmes. If employees do take action which gives rise to security concerns, then the likely consequences of that action should be made clear in the employer's disciplinary procedures (see the ""disciplinary procedures"" section below).

**Disclosing convictions2**

Employers may wish to consider whether or not they should require employees and job applicants to disclose any criminal convictions, or convictions of a particular nature, received prior to or during the period of employment. If it is decided that there will be such a requirement, this should be made explicit to affected individuals, and a short explanation should be provided as to precisely what information is required and why (eg all unspent convictions or only unspent convictions for offences involving violence or dishonesty, etc.) Again, it should be made clear in employers' procedures what the likely effect particular types of offence would have on job applications, or continued employment respectively.

Where it is proportionate to the risks identified, and permitted by the law, employers may decide that particular roles should also require a criminal records check ('disclosure') as part of the selection process. Disclosure takes three forms: 'basic disclosure' will reveal all criminal convictions considered to be 'unspent' - job applicants can be asked to apply for basic disclosure in their own names from Disclosure Scotland or Access Northern Ireland, and submit the result to the employer. More extensive checks ('standard' or 'enhanced' disclosures) may be requested by certain employers for certain, sensitive jobs. You may wish to seek HR and/or legal advice before deciding whether a criminal record check is to be required for any particular role.

If an employer decides to consider criminal convictions as part of the recruitment process (or even determines that certain criminal convictions should serve to disqualify an applicant) they would need to be sure that any such policy was compliant with the Data Protection Act 1998, and was applied fairly in each individual case. The policy should be clearly set out in company procedures, and provided to job applicants.

**Disciplinary procedures**

Guidance to employers on investigating potential misconduct, and taking disciplinary action up to and including dismissal, is readily available. **3**

The Acas Code (which is a statutory Code) sets out the basic requirements of fairness in handling disciplinary cases. An unreasonable failure to comply with the Acas Code can lead to an uplift of compensation awards made against employers in claims for unfair dismissal by up to 25%. 

Employers may wish to consider making explicit - through terms and conditions of employment, and company disciplinary procedures, with messages reinforced during induction programmes and other training - which concerns, or what degree of severity in employee action, would lead to a particular course of disciplinary action on behalf of the company.

It is particularly important in the context of security-related conduct to make clear what action is likely to constitute gross misconduct, as that is conduct which is so serious that it overturns the contract of employment, justifying summary dismissal (ie dismissal without notice). **4** The Acas Guide sets out a non-exhaustive list of possible examples of gross misconduct. **5** Provided that these matters are brought to the attention of employees, and that fair procedures are followed in response to any potential breach, then employers are more likely to be able to defend successfully any subsequent claim for unfair dismissal. 

Refusal or withdrawal of government security clearance will not, in itself, be a reason for disciplinary action; however the underlying justification for that decision may be: for example support for terrorism or criminality that merits action because of its implications for employment.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/shared-services-futures-pin,Government shared services (Swansea) project,Notice to the market of an organisations intention to start advertising high spend items before officially starting a procurement process.,"## Project update

On 18 July 2011, the Department for Transport (DfT) commenced the procurement process for divestment of its Shared Service Centre by issuing a contract notice in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU). Those companies interested in buying the Shared Service Centre were asked to respond to the OJEU and complete a pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ) assessed their suitability to be invited to continue in the procurement process. 

The Department for Transport's Board believes that another organisation whose core business is in shared services will be much more likely to grow the business successfully, taking full advantage of the Shared Service Centre's spare capacity to help it grow far faster. For the Department this means cost savings as we become one customer of a larger operation.

It is intended that the successful tender would acquire the DfT Shared Service Centre in Swansea (including accommodation, staff obligations and its assets). Once divestment is complete, we have agreed with the Cabinet Office that the DfT's Shared Service Centre will become one of a small number of centres that will provide these services to government departments. Each of these centres will be serving substantial numbers of users to maximise efficiency for government providing further opportunities for the Centre and its staff once in the private sector.

On 17th August 2011, the Department for Transport received completed Pre-Qualification Questionnaires and following a full evaluation and moderation process, a long list of Potential Bidders were invited to continue in the competition. On the 29th September they were issued with an Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ItPD) and an Invitation to Submit an Outline Solution (ISOS).

The ItPD gives an overview of the DfT family's requirements and the procurement process. The ISOS is each Potential Bidder's plans to grow the existing business. These ""Outline Solutions"" will be used to select a minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 potential bidders to continue to take part in the procurement process and be short-listed.

All potential bidders had until Thursday 10th November 2011 to submit their Outline Solutions. Following this there was a period of several weeks during which the Outline Solutions were evaluated and moderated. On 19th January 2012, the Department is inviting 3 of the 11 potential bidders to continue in the competition. The successful organisations - in alphabetical order - at ISOS are: 

  * Arvato AG
  * Capita Business Services Limited
  * HP Enterprise Services UK Limited (HP ES UK Ltd) 

These shortlisted bidders have been issued with an 'Invitation to Continue in Dialogue' (ITCD). This starts the next stage of more detailed dialogue which is expected to formally start in February 2012 and last for a period of 3-4 months.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/signing-the-way,Signing the way: traffic signs policy review,"The policy framework for ensuring our traffic system meets the future needs of all road users, while building upon the existing and established traffic sign system.","## Introduction

This document sets out a policy framework for ensuring our traffic system meets the future needs of all road users, while building upon the existing and established traffic sign system. It sets out recommendations for improving the information that traffic signs communicate to road users by providing more freedom for decisions about signing at the local level.

## Summary of recommendations

The review process has been informed and managed by the large numbers of key stakeholders involved in this project, and many of these have directly contributed to the large amount of research that has been undertaken. This research shaped a series of wide-ranging recommendations set out below:

### Provide more flexibility for local traffic authorities 

  * While it is essential that there is national consistency in traffic sign design the current level of prescription that the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) requires can be a barrier to local authorities working effectively. The review sets out recommendations to reduce regulation and provide more flexibility for local authorities.

### Reduce traffic signing on the road network

  * Traffic signs can clutter the highway network if used to excess which makes our roads look unattractive and can be a distraction for road users. The review provides a range of recommendations to improve the way our roads look, for example, by removing the requirements for some signing; helping local authorities through new DfT guidance on auditing traffic signs and removing unnecessary traffic signs, and encouraging local authorities to place traffic signs only where they are needed.

### Deliver effective enforcement

  * Traffic signs are needed to ensure that road users know when restrictions and prohibitions apply to them. The review delivers recommendations and proposals that will enable local authorities to design parking signs that better meet local needs, while providing simpler, more concise design; simplify the Traffic Regulation Order process; and provide more flexibility for the design of 20 mph speed limit zones.

### Traffic signs for all road users

  * The review recognises that travel behaviour is changing as people make more sustainable transport choices. The review provides a range of proposals for improved signs and traffic signals that will help pedestrians as well as promoting safer cycling and allowing more innovative measures to be used on the roads.

### Provide road users with better information

  * Traffic signs provide essential information for those using the roads. The review will help ensure better information is provided including new traffic signs to inform road users that there is disruption on other travel networks; when travel conditions are affected by bad weather; that the road ahead is unsuitable for heavy goods vehicles; and the road user is entering a shared space traffic management scheme.

### Develop local solutions built on local knowledge

  * The government believes that interventions at the local level can provide significant improvements to the transport network. The review's recommendations will increase the involvement of the local community in the use and design of signing by encouraging better consultation with local residents for traffic and parking restrictions; ensuring that the publicity relating to TROs is more targeted; and encouraging local community audits of traffic signs.

## Implementation

The Department will implement these recommendations in stages. Amendments to TSRGD came into force on 30 January 2012 reducing the administrative burden on local authorities by prescribing many of the non-prescribed traffic signs that are frequently authorised by the Department.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/smarter-choices-changing-the-way-we-travel-main-document,Smarter Choices - Changing the way we travel: main document,"The impact of soft measures, using evidence from the UK and abroad, case study interviews and the experiences of stakeholders.","In recent years, there has been growing interest in a range of initiatives, which are now widely described as 'soft' transport policy measures. These seek to give better information and opportunities, aimed at helping people to choose to reduce their car use while enhancing the attractiveness of alternatives. They are fairly new as part of mainstream transport policy, mostly relatively uncontroversial, and often popular. They include:

  * Workplace and school travel plans;
  * Personalised travel planning, travel awareness campaigns, and public transport information and marketing;
  * Car clubs and car sharing schemes;
  * Teleworking, teleconferencing and home shopping.

This report draws on earlier studies of the impact of soft measures, new evidence from the UK and abroad, case study interviews relating to 24 specific initiatives, and the experience of commercial, public and voluntary stakeholders involved in organising such schemes. Each of the soft factors is analysed separately, followed by an assessment of their combined potential impact.

The assessment focuses on two different policy scenarios for the next ten years. The **'high intensity'** scenario identifies the potential provided by a significant expansion of activity to a much more widespread implementation of present good practice, albeit to a realistic level which still recognises the constraints of money and other resources, and variation in the suitability and effectiveness of soft factors according to local circumstances. The **'low intensity'** scenario is broadly defined as a projection of the present (2003-4) levels of local and national activity on soft measures.

The main features of the high intensity scenario would be

  * A reduction in peak period urban traffic of about 21% (off-peak 13%);
  * A reduction of peak period non-urban traffic of about 14% (off-peak 7%);
  * A nationwide reduction in all traffic of about 11%.

These projected changes in traffic levels are quite large (though consistent with other evidence on behavioural change at the individual level), and would produce substantial reductions in congestion. However, this would tend to attract more car use, by other people, which could offset the impact of those who reduce their car use unless there are measures in place to prevent this. Therefore, those experienced in the implementation of soft factors locally usually emphasise that success depends on some or all of such supportive policies as re-allocation of road capacity and other measures to improve public transport service levels, parking control, traffic calming, pedestrianisation, cycle networks, congestion charging or other traffic restraint, other use of transport prices and fares, speed regulation, or stronger legal enforcement levels. The report also records a number of suggestions about local and national policy measures that could facilitate the expansion of soft measures.

The effects of the low intensity scenario, in which soft factors are not given increased policy priority compared with present practice, are estimated to be considerably less than those of the high intensity scenario, including a reduction in peak period urban traffic of about 5%, and a nationwide reduction in all traffic of 2%-3%. These smaller figures also assume that sufficient other supporting policies are used to prevent induced traffic from eroding the effects, notably at peak periods and in congested conditions. Without these supportive measures, the effects could be lower, temporary, and perhaps invisible.

Previous advice given by the Department for Transport in relation to multi-modal studies was that soft factors might achieve a nationwide traffic reduction of about 5%. The policy assumptions underpinning this advice were similar to those used in our low intensity scenario: our estimate is slightly less, but the difference is probably within the range of error of such projections.

The public expenditure cost of achieving reduced car use by soft measures, on average, is estimated at about 1.5 pence per car kilometre, ie ?15 for removing each 1000 vehicle kilometres of traffic. Current official practice calculates the benefit of reduced traffic congestion, on average, to be about 15p per car kilometre removed, and more than three times this level in congested urban conditions. Thus every ?1 spent on well-designed soft measures could bring about ?10 of benefit in reduced congestion alone, more in the most congested conditions, and with further potential gains from environmental improvements and other effects, provided that the tendency of induced traffic to erode such benefits is controlled. There are also opportunities for private business expenditure on some soft measures, which can result in offsetting cost savings.

Much of the experience of implementing soft factors is recent, and the evidence is of variable quality. Therefore, there are inevitably uncertainties in the results. With this caveat, the main conclusion is that, provided they are implemented within a supportive policy context, soft measures can be sufficiently effective in facilitating choices to reduce car use, and offer sufficiently good value for money, that they merit serious consideration for an expanded role in local and national transport strategy.

Social research generates data and analysis using the methods of social science such as social surveys, focus groups, in-depth interviews, case studies and innovative methods such as deliberative research. In addition to these methods, policy evaluation also involves cost-benefit analyses, and measures the delivery of policies and initiatives against objectives. This enables DfT to better understand policy impacts and outcomes, and lessons learned can then be applied to improve DfT policies and services in the future.

[1] DELs are the amounts that Departments are limited to spending in each year, and are carefully monitored by the Treasury to ensure they don't go over those limits. DELs are set for a multi-year period at Spending Reviews. DEL is divided between two different types of spending - capital spending and resource spending:

  * **Capital** spending (referred to as **CDEL** in departmental budgets) is money spent on assets - that is, items that will last more than twelve months and be used repeatedly. It encompasses things like infrastructure spending, such as building a road or a hospital.
  * **Resource** spending (referred to as **RDEL** in departmental budgets) is money that is spent on the day to day running of a department, and the delivery of public services. Resource spending can be further divided between the programme budget (money spent on the provision of services, for example medicine) and the administration budget (back office costs, non-frontline staffing costs).

[2] In this table, Resource DEL excludes depreciation

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/sroh,Specification for the reinstatement of openings in highways,The standards to which streets must be reinstated after works are set out in the Specification of the Reinstatement of Openings in Highways (SROH).,"## Summary

Statutory undertakers (mostly utilities) must reinstate the street after they have finished their works in such a way that minimises any long-term damage to the street and takes into account aesthetic considerations. The standards to which they must reinstate the street are set out in the Specification of the Reinstatement of Openings in Highways (SROH). This statutory code is published by the Secretary of State under Section 71 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991. Changes in SROH provide a wider range of approved materials and working methods to undertakers carrying out works.

## SROH third edition

The new edition contains new or expanded provisions on: block paving, chalk materials, sustainable alternative reinstatement materials, specialist surfacing materials, permissible layer thicknesses, laying temperatures for asphalt materials, a performance specification for compacting materials and new British Standards for asphalt materials covering composition and binder contents.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/standards-overview,Transport Direct standards overview,Standards for the way in which data can be exchanged between interested parties.,"One of the key activities for the Transport Direct team is to engage with relevant parties to set standards for the way in which data can be exchanged between interested parties - particularly, but not exclusively, to meet the needs of the Transport Direct service itself.  This is work that is also of wider interest both within Europe and Internationally.

Transport Direct is seeking to ensure that work in the UK complies with or even leads the emerging relevant standards. There are close relationships between each of these initiatives that will improve significantly the quality and consistency of information available about bus and other public transport services - to the benefit of operators and the providers of information services such as traveline, as well as for Transport Direct itself.

A catalogue of standards and standards-like initiatives relevant to Transport Direct and an analysis of the areas in which standards are inadequate to support the successful development of Transport Direct was prepared by Curtis and Cartwright Consulting Limited (now Centaur Consulting), with the independent assistance of Peter Warman, in 2001. An updated Catalogue of standards for travel information and retailing was published in November 2007 by Centaur Consulting, with assistance from Kizoom. The Catalogue should be read along side the Review of standards for travel information and retailing and A Guide to standards for travel information and retailing.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/stopping-up-diversion-of-highways,Stopping up and diversion of highways,Application form and guidance for applying to close or divert highways.,"Orders under this section allow the closing or diverting of highways to allow development. The highways involved must include an all-purpose highway (or a part of one). If that is the case then the order may also include footpaths, bridleways or cycle tracks. If the order would only be for footpaths, bridleways or cycle tracks then an order should be made to the local authority that grant planning permission under section 257 of the act. 

The Secretary of State will normally need full planning permission to progress an application and must be satisfied that there is justification for the stopping ups. The applicant should provide: 

  * a copy of the approved site layout plan to its true plan scale 
  * a copy of the planning permission
  * an application form

This Strategic rail freight policy guidance sets out government policy for Strategic Rail Freight Interchange (SRFI) infrastructure. It has been produced in the interim pending the publication of the Department for Transport's consultation document on the National Networks National Policy Statement (NPS). It may be taken into account by the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) in its decision making on the development consent applications for SRFI infrastructure that fall within the definition of a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) as defined in the Planning Act 2008.1 It should give some comfort to developers about how their schemes will be received.

The National Networks NPS which will follow will set out an integrated road and rail policy, the need for new NSIPs relating to these and the associated impacts in greater detail.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/street-works-best-practice,Street works best practice,Principles and examples of best practice for the implementation of street works and highway works.,"## Best practice in street works and highway works: Introduction

Growth in the economy, the introduction of competition into undertakers' services and increasing customer demand for essential services has brought with it increasing numbers of excavations in the streets in order to supply these services.

The increase in the number of undertakers licensed to lay mains and cables, within our streets, brings with it the increased potential for conflict between the undertakers who have the statutory rights to use the streets for provision of essential services, the highway authorities and others who maintain them, and those who use the streets for transport purposes who are the recipients of those services.

In the interests of the community and the economy, it is important that the safe and efficient movement of traffic, pedestrians and cyclists is maintained on the streets and, also, in the vicinity of trams, light rail and level crossings. To facilitate this, the guidance, based on operational experience, provides principles and examples of best practice for the implementation of street works and highway works. Its aim is to help undertakers, highway authorities and other organisations carrying out works in the street to build on these principles in the future to avoid unnecessary disruption and inconvenience to highway users.

In particular, this guidance provides examples of best practice in street works, which build on the principles of the Highway Authorities and Utilities Committee (HAUC) Codes of Practice, and best practice in highway works under the Highways Act 1980. The highway authorities, undertakers and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) all agreed that such examples of best practice are desirable.

All involved in the planning, supervision, execution and monitoring of street works and highway works are encouraged to implement the works whilst carrying out their respective duties under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 (NRSWA) the Highways Act 1980 and health and safety legislation.

The document is intended to cover all works but specifically planned major works and planned maintenance and works on busy and strategic routes. It does not remove or affect the undertakers' or authorities' statutory rights to carry out emergency, urgent, provision and restoration of customer service or routine maintenance works. The guidance will periodically be updated to reflect current practice that will then encourage continuous improvement in line with Best Value legislation.

The third edition of this code came into force (replacing the 2nd Edition) on 1 April 2008. The Code provides practical guidance on a range of responsibilities for authorities and undertakers. The current revision, published in August 2009, replaces the version released in 2008 and includes a chapter on overrun charges.

## Non-compliance

Undertakers not complying with the noticing requirements can be served with a fixed penalty notice under The Street Works (Fixed Penalty) (England) Regulations 2007.

The role and responsibility of the highways authority is to maintain, reconstruct and improve the highway in the interests of, and protecting the rights of, the public. Where a highway authority considers improvement works (often major improvements) are needed it is possible that undertakers (utilities) apparatus running under a highway may need to be diverted - these become 'diversionary works'.

## Definitions of Common Terms 

### Street works

Works carried out by statutory undertakers, or licensees under section 50 of New Roads and Street Works Act 1980, or their contractors, to install, inspect, maintain, repair or replace apparatus are known as street works.

### Road works (or ""works for road purposes"")

These are works usually carried out by highway authorities to repair, maintain or replace highways, which under highways law includes the footway or pavement. This will include works to replace or maintain street lighting, even if carried out on behalf of the council by an electricity distribution company.

### Statutory undertakers

Most utility companies are statutory undertakers. Statutory undertakers have a statutory right or duty to install, inspect, maintain, repair, or replace apparatus in or under the street in primary legislation.

This legislation is:

  * Gas Act 1986 as amended by the Gas Act 1995 (schedule 3)
  * Electricity Act 1989 (schedule 4)
  * Water Resources Act 1991 (section 159)
  * Telecommunications Act 1984 as amended by schedule 3 of the Communications Act 2003

### Local highway authority

In areas with single tier (""unitary"") authorities this is the local council. In two-tier areas (i.e. where there are district councils and a county council), it is the county council that is the local highway authority. 

In London, for those roads that form the London Strategic Route Network (LSRN) the local highway authority is Transport for London, otherwise it is the London Borough Council. 

For motorways and trunk roads the highway authority is the Highways Agency. 

## General:

**Q1. How do I find out about road works or street works? **

Local authorities maintain a street and road works register that may be accessible through the internet. It is also possible to inspect it by visiting your local authority. The register includes information on planned works, some indication of the nature of the works, and how long they are expected to last.Links to local authority websites can be found at [www.direct.gov.uk](http://www.direct.gov.uk/).

The Highways Agency at [http://www.highways.gov.uk/traffic/traffic.aspx](http://www.highways.gov.uk/traffic/traffic.aspx) has traffic information that will include the impact of road or street works on the motorway and trunk road network.

There is no central database of road works, though many local authorities make information available through the [ELGIN website](http://www.elgin.gov.uk/)

**Q2: Who do I complain to if I'm unhappy about some street works in my area?**

In the first instance you should complain to the utility company, contractor or other organisation responsible for the works. All street works sites should have an information board explaining who is responsible for the works and providing their telephone number. If there is no information board, or you are not satisfied with the response, you may wish to speak to the local highway authority (see Definitions of Common Terms). They should know who is responsible for the works, and are responsible for the coordination and monitoring of works on their road network.

The Department for Transport cannot get involved in individual complaints or disputes between members of the public, street works undertakers and local highway authorities. 

**Q3.What is the current position on undertakers carrying out street works at night?**

Section 56 of NRSWA (New Road and Streetworks Act 1991) allows an authority to direct an undertaker to carry out works at certain times, but only if they believe that the work is likely to cause serious traffic disruption. Authorities need to exercise discretion in the use of this power and cannot direct work to be done at specific times if this conflicts with restrictions on noise or other nuisance. It may be that works cause least disruption to traffic if they are carried out at night or weekends.

If you are concerned about noise you should contact your local authority environmental health or street works manager.

**Q4: Am I entitled to compensation for loss of trade during street works?**

When a highway authority or undertaker carries out works in a road under its statutory powers or duties, there is no general liability in law for loss of trade resulting from a falling away in the number of passers-by and so no liability to pay compensation. It is a long established principle that traders have no right to any particular level of passing trade: business may fluctuate for a number of reasons.

**However**, there may be entitlement to compensation if something is done improperly, for instance if access to business premises is blocked and customers cannot gain access. 

**Gas and Water** - It may be possible for small businesses to claim compensation for losses resulting from works executed by gas companies. Water industry legislation also provides for compensation in certain circumstances. In such cases, it is for the individual trader to raise the matter with the company concerned. However, each claim will be treated on its merits, and it may be difficult to prove that a particular level of trading loss is attributable either wholly or mainly to works in the highway. 

For works by a **highway authority**, there are no plans to introduce a statutory duty to pay compensation for loss of trade. Such works benefit the whole community, including businesses and others, who, while they may be adversely affected in the short term, will benefit in the long term. The highway authority has a statutory obligation to maintain the highway to a reasonable standard. The provision of a compensation scheme would have to be met by either increased local taxation or by reductions in expenditure (perhaps by cutting back on the amount of maintenance undertaken).

**Q5: What is the current policy on trench sharing?**

It is possible for two or more utilities to time their works in such a way that where one company has opened the street in order (for instance) to renew cable or pipe work, others with equipment in the same stretch of road can effect their own repairs before the road surface is reinstated. NRSWA facilitates collaboration, since it requires undertakers to give advance notice to the highway authority and each other of their intention to carry out works in the street. It imposes on the highway authorities a duty to co-ordinate their own and utilities' works in the streets for which they are responsible, while utilities are required to co-operate with the highway authority and each other.

**Q6: When can multi ducting be used?**

It is possible to install purpose-built structures to accommodate multi-ducting when completely new infrastructure is being provided, for instance new housing developments, but in general where apparatus is already in place under existing roads and footways there is little or no scope for their use. Different types of utilities have different requirements as to the depth at which equipment should be laid, and there are hazards associated with laying some equipment (e.g. gas pipes) in enclosed structures. 

**Q7: Does New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 apply when installing apparatus over the highway?**

The definition of street works in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 (NRSWA) includes ""works…executed in the street…placing apparatus"", includes apparatus installed above the street. Not all requirements in NRSWA will apply, however, and some only apply where the street is being excavated or opened up. Provisions that are likely to be relevant to works installing utility apparatus over the street include:

  * that street works may be executed only by (or on behalf of) an organisation who either has a statutory right to carry out street works (eg by virtue of the Telecommunications Code) or who holds a licence issued by the relevant highway authority under NRSWA;
  * [requirements to give various notices](/publications/street-works-co-ordination/#cop) in respect of the works to the relevant highway authority (or in certain parts of the country to [obtain a permit](/publications/permits/#decision-making) from that authority;
  * the duty to place appropriate traffic signs, and in doing so to comply with the [Safety at street works and road works code of practice](/publications/street-works-safety), the duty to keep records of apparatus in the street.

The statutory duty for street works operatives / supervisors to hold certain qualifications under NRSWA applies only in respect of street works that involve breaking up or opening the street. However, general health and safety duties still apply.

## Safety at Street Works and Road Works:

**Q8: What duties do undertakers have to allow people to get past their works safely?**

Undertakers (mostly utilities) carrying out works in the highway are required by law to have regard to the needs of road users, particularly those with disabilities, when signing, lighting and guarding their works. The [Safety at street works and road works code of practice](/publications/street-works-safety) sets out their specific obligations in detail.

**Q9: When should an information board be displayed?**

An information board must be displayed at every site involving the use of a vehicle. This does not apply to mobile works, and minor works which do not include excavation. The boards should not obstruct footways or carriageways, but should be where they can be read by pedestrians, and possibly stationary drivers.

**Q10: What should the information boards include?**

A. The board must give the name of the organisation for which the works are being carried out, and a telephone number which can be contacted in emergencies. It may contain other information, for instance explaining why the works are being done, who is doing it, and how long it will take. Such additional information is encouraged where practical. A completion date should normally be included if the works are expected to continue for more than a month. 

**Q11: What are the rules governing signing at street works?**

A. [Safety at street works and road works code of practice](/publications/street-works-safety) sets out the minimum and maximum distances for signs leading to works in the road. 

There is no exemption for those engaged on emergency work from compliance with the safety requirements; and undertakers who are likely to be called upon to carry out emergency work should therefore obtain and take with them signs of the correct size for the situations they are likely to be called to attend.

Only the courts can determine liability in the event of an accident where it is claimed that the signing was inadequate and not in accordance with the Safety Code. In all cases, the priority must be to prevent accidents arising from poor signing in the first place.

**Q12: What are the penalties for failing to adhere to the Safety Code?**

Failure to adhere to the Safety Code may under section 65(4) of NRSWA (New Roads and Street Works Act 1991) result in a summary criminal offence which at a Magistrates Court has a maximum penalty of £5,000, but which is unlimited at Crown Court. 

Personal injury claims have to be settled at common law. Such claims are outside the scope of New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.

**Q13: What is the progress on the revision of the Safety Code?**

The revision of the Safety Code is still under consideration after the consultation and with respect to the Government's priorities on reducing regulation. If a decision is taken to publish a new edition of the Code, it is likely to be published in spring 2013 and to come into force in 6-12 months later. This would allow ample time for all concerned to familiarise themselves with the new requirements. We will make further announcements in due course.

## Permits:

**Q16: What is a permit scheme, and what does it achieve? **

A permit scheme requires those carrying out street works or road works to obtain a permit from the highway authority first. A permit system is pro-active as the undertaker has to actively seek permission to work and an authority needs to consider whether it is appropriate to grant the permit. It therefore gives authorities more scope to coordinate the timing of works in order to reduce disruption. Permits can also be granted with conditions attached, for example covering the times of day at which works may be carried out.

**Q17: When a utility applies for a permit to work, what documents need to accompany each application?**

This is a matter for each local authority to consider and it will be defined in their permit scheme.

**Q18: In a permit scheme will the local authorities' own works also have permit conditions?**

Yes, to ensure parity with the utility works, local authorities have to apply similar permit conditions to their own works as they would to a utility led work.

**Q19: Where two or more utilities are carrying out work at the same time as highway maintenance work what level of discount will there be for utility permits? Also, does the local authority have a role in being pro-active in trying to encourage working together?**

Regulations 31(4) of the permit regulations deals with situation where discounts must be applied, when one or more promoters are collaborating to reduce the impact of their works. Provided the objective of reducing impact is met, such circumstances could include:

  * Where an activity is to be carried out in more than one phase;
  * Where an activity is part of a project that involves working on more than one adjacent street. Project in this context means a set of works that is of the order as would take place in a single street but which happens to cover more than one street, e.g. if repairs on a pipe go round a corner from one street into another. It is not intended to cover whole area wide projects in a single permit scheme;
  * Where an activity involves more than one promoter collaborating in a single co-ordinated set of works. Permit Authorities should provide that where highway authority promoters are collaborating with undertakers, those undertakers will be eligible for the discount in regulation 31(5).

**Q20: Will it be clear in the Gazetteer that a permit is required?**

Yes. It will be clear from the Gazetteer if the authority operates a permit scheme and whether this is all streets or just certain streets and if so, which ones.

**Q21: If you have had no response about a permit within a minimum period what happens then?**

In these situations a works promoter can assume that permit is deemed to be granted (each permit will have a fee associated with it).

**Q22: How will utilities know which authorities will be running permit schemes? **

Regulations require a highway authority making an application to the Secretary of State to operate a permit scheme to have carried out a full consultation in relation to the scheme prior to their application, following government's code of practice for consultations. This should include all persons identified as having an interest in any of the streets covered by the permit scheme in the Associated Street Data for those streets.

**Q23: Who must a local authority consult about setting up a permit scheme? Why can they not decide this themselves?**

The permit regulations require a highway authority making an application to the Secretary of State to run a permit scheme to have carried out a full consultation in relation to the scheme. Those stakeholders that must be consulted are set out in regulation 3:

  * every person who carries out works in the proposed specified area from time to time, to the extent the Permit Authority is aware of them doing so; 
  * every local authority other than the Permit Authority in whose area is situated any street to which the proposed permit scheme relates; 
  * where any street to which the proposed permit scheme relates is in Greater London, Transport for London; 
  * where any street to which the proposed permit scheme relates is in the passenger transport area of a Passenger Transport Executive, the relevant Passenger Transport Executive; 
  * the emergency services which operate in the proposed specified area; 
  * the Secretary of State; and 
  * such other persons as the Permit Authority considers appropriate. 

**Q24: Is the notice period prescribed in the code of practice for notices different than for permits? **

No, although Permits and Notices are different regimes the minimum application periods for permits and notice periods for notices are the same. The fundamental difference between permits and noticing is that for permits there is a requirement to obtain permission to carry out activities on the street (effectively booking a time slot), where as noticing is informing the authority of the intention to work. Timescales for the application for permits is given in section 59 of the Permits statutory Guidance and chapter 11 of the Permits Code of Practice.

**Q25: What will be the fee for a permit, are they going to be different for different categories of roads? **

The power to charge a permit fee is detailed in regulations.  The maximum fees chargeable are set out in section 78 of the statutory guidance and Chapter 15 of the permits code of practice. Different categories of road may attract different fee levels.  A highway authority will have to justify the level of permit fees to the Secretary of State in their application to run a scheme.

**Q26: Who pays for administrative costs of highway permits? **

The local authority bears the costs of permits for its own works. In putting forward a permit scheme, the authority needs to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs incurred in operating a permit scheme.

## Overrun Charges:

**Q27: What powers do authorities have to penalise utilities when they take longer than they should?**

Authorities have the ability to levy charges where the utility takes longer completing works than they agreed with the authority.

**Q28: Why do I see lots of works where there is no one working - authority should financially penalise utilities when this happens? **

There are many legitimate reasons why works are sometimes left unoccupied. These include waiting for materials to cure and gas to vent before work can take place. 

However authorities should agree time frames for works that are challenging but realistic, allowing the works to take place safely but at the same time ensure that the carriageway is not occupied unnecessarily. 

**Q29: Some works still overrun - what is the Government doing about them?**

The Government is proposing to raise the changes that authorities can levy to further reduce the number of works which overrun. 

**Q30: When will the Government raise overrun charges as it states in the DFT business plan?**

The Department has committed in the departmental business plan for the project to be completed by October 2011. 

## Inspections:

**Q31: With a permit system will it be possible to charge for inspections?**

The cost of the inspections will not be included in the permit fees charged to utilities. However, it is expected that these will be provided for when the arrangements for street works inspections are next reformed.

## Street Works Co-ordination: 

**Q32: Street works have just started near me. Can utilities just dig up the road whenever they want to?**

Disruption of journeys can be very frustrating. Undertakers are legally obliged to give notice of up to three months to the local highway authority - how much depends on what kind of road is affected, and what kind of works are planned. The highway authority has a duty to co-ordinate works on their network - speak to them if you have concerns. It must be remembered, however, that utilities need access to their networks to provide us with essential services.

Local highway authorities can also apply for approval to run permit schemes, under which utilities require the highway authority's permission to carry out works - rather than merely having to notify them.

**Q33: How much notice should I give of my works?**

The [co-ordination code of practice](/publications/street-works-co-ordination/#cop) sets out in detail requirements for undertakers to give notice of their works.

**Q34: Why does the authority not make the utilities do the works at the same time? **

Authorities have a duty to co-ordinate works which includes encouraging joint working. However many works have to be undertaken immediately, such as emergency works or customer connections.

## Lane Rental:

**Q35: What is lane rental?**

Lane rental would involve utility companies (and others undertaking street works) being required to pay a daily charge for the duration of their works. The charge would be paid to the local council (the ""highway authority""). 

**Q36: How would it help?**

A daily charge should encourage utility companies and others to complete their works more quickly and therefore with less disruption to road users and local communities. This is because every day's reduction in the duration of their works would save them a day's charges. 

A well-designed charging system would also include exemptions or discounts from the daily charge when works are completed at less busy times. So by spending a bit more - say on overtime to get the job done at evenings or weekends - utilities and others carrying out works could avoid having to pay the charges.

**Q37: Why can't local authorities charge lane rental today?**

Local authorities need legal powers in order to impose charges on others. New Regulations are needed - and these will set out things like the maximum charge rate that a local authority can impose.

Once the Regulations are in place, any local authority wishing to impose lane rental charges will need the approval of the Secretary of State for Transport. He will need to be satisfied that any scheme proposals will deliver a reduction in congestion and disruption that is large enough to justify the extra costs that would be involved for utility companies and others. 

**Q38: Does this mean lane rental will be happening all over the country?**

Lane rental has not yet been proven to be a successful model in the UK. In the first instance, any lane rental schemes would need to be targeted just on the very busiest streets in a particular area - likely to include key junctions and other pinch-points, plus the busiest and most congested stretches of road. It is also envisaged that approval would be granted only for a very small number of trial schemes.

Evidence of the effects of any initial pilot schemes will inform future decisions on whether lane rental could usefully play a wider role.

**Q39: What will happen to the revenues paid by utility companies and others?**

The revenues would accrue to the local council responsible for the scheme - the ""highway authority"". The new Regulations will need to set out what the revenues can be used for.

**Q40: What will the new Regulations say? When will they be published?**

The Department for Transport's business plan sys we will consult on new Regulations for lane rental, and finalise them in December 2011. We expect to be consulting on the draft Regulations, and some supporting guidance, over the summer. 

**Q41: When will lane rental charging be up and running?**

It will be for local authorities to develop proposals for lane rental, and submit them to the Secretary of State for Transport. We will be publishing guidance to explain what conditions will need to be met in order for a proposed scheme to be approved. 

It will be possible to approve schemes once the new Regulations are in force - but this will depend on high-quality scheme proposals being submitted by interested local authorities.

**Q42: Will there be lane rental in my area?**

At present, the Department is only contemplating a very small number of local ""pilot"" schemes, targeted on the very busiest and most congested streets. We cannot yet say where those places will be - this will depend on what proposals are developed by local authorities, and which of these are ultimately approved by the Secretary of State.

## Specification for Reinstatement of Openings in Highways:

**Q43: What powers do authorities have if utility reinstatements are not good enough? Can authorities make utilities rectify the problem?**

Utility reinstatements have to meet the standard set out in the code of practice Specifications for the Reinstatement of Openings in the Highways. If it does not meet this standard, and it is within the guarantee period (two or three years for deep excavations) the highway authority can make the utility to put good the fault. 

## Queries Regarding Highways Act 1980:

**Q44: What are the rules covering obstruction of the highway by a shop's goods?**  
** **  
Obstruction of the highway is dealt with in sections 137, 143, 148, and 149 of the Highways Act 1980. It is an offence to deposit anything on the highway which ""interrupts"" a person using the highway. This includes the pavement (known as a ""footway""), which under highways law is a part of the highway. The highway authority can give notice requiring the removal of anything constituting a nuisance. The law applies as much to footways as to those parts of the highway which are designated for use by vehicles.

When looking at individual cases the first step should be to determine whether the land on which items are deposited forms part of the highway. Sometimes the land in front of a shop is not part of the highway, but is private property to which the public have access on the sufferance of the landowner. This may occur, for instance, where a shop owner has paved over land in his ownership immediately in front of his shop and removed any barrier separating it from the footway which forms part of the highway. Thus, an authority has no power to take action under the Highways Act if the owner chooses to advertise his services by means of a board placed on his own land. They do however have certain powers under section 166 of the Act to require forecourts of premises abutting a street to be fenced if they consider the display of goods to be a source of danger, obstruction, or inconvenience to the public. 

**Q45: What are the penalties for a shopkeeper obstructing the highway?**

Where it is clear that a shopkeeper has been depositing goods or advertising boards on a footway forming part of the highway, the provisions of the Highways Act 1980 apply and it is for the highway authority to decide what action to take. Where, for example, they consider that this constitutes a nuisance to users of the highway, they have powers under section 149 of the 1980 Act to serve a notice on the person responsible for depositing anything on the highway to remove it forthwith, or where they believe it constitutes a danger to the public, to recover it themselves immediately. A highway authority can apply to a magistrates court to recover their reasonable expenses and obtain a disposal order where they have taken action themselves to remove an obstruction on the highway.

Legal action by the highway authority is of course a final resort. In many cases of encroachment onto a footway by a retailer which constitutes a nuisance, discussion between the authority and the offender can be expected to bring about an acceptable compromise without the need for the authority to prosecute.

**Q46: What are the rules governing skips on the highway?**

Under section 139 of the Highways Act 1980 a builder's skip may lawfully stand on the highway, but only with the consent of the local highway authority, and subject to the conditions that the local authority sets, which must include requirements for lighting and guarding the skip and the manner in which it is to be coated with paint or other material to enhance visibility. Under section 139(4) of the 1980 Act it is an offence, punishable by a fine, to deposit a skip on the highway but not comply with any conditions the authority may have imposed, or with regulations imposing marking requirements.

**Q47: What are the rules on skip lighting?**

Skips are currently required by section 139(4) of the Highways Act 1980 to be ""properly lighted during the hours of darkness"".  It is for the highway authority, when granting permission for the skip to be placed on the highway, to specify ""the manner in which it is to be lighted or guarded. This matter is not regulated. Skips are also required to have reflective markings, prescribed by the Builders' Skips (Markings) Regulations 1984.

**Q48: Can I claim compensation for tripping over an uneven pavement?**

The Department cannot advise on this issue. If you feel you might have a case for compensation, you should seek professional legal advice.

**Q49: How do I go about finding out how to get the footpath lowered outside my address?**

Your local Council, acting as the highway authority, is responsible for maintaining the footpath. If you want the path lowered so that you can cross the footway to park a car, this would have to be approved by your local council. They would usually commission someone to do the work.",guidance,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,,department-for-transport,,,,21-Jul-2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inspections take place while works are in progress (to check that appropriate signage and barriers are in place to protect workers and road users) and once they have finished (to check that the site has been properly cleared and the road reinstated to a proper standard). Authorities have legal powers to recover a fee for various types of inspection, and these are set out in regulations and a Code of Practice.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/street-works-lane-rental,Street works lane-rental,The Department is currently developing legislative proposals to allow local highway authorities in England to impose daily charges on utility companies and other street works undertakers while their works are occupying the highway.,"## Summary

Following a consultation carried out in late 2011, the government has decided to allow lane rental schemes to be trialled by a small number of local authorities in England. Lane rental would involve the local authority applying a daily charge where street works obstruct traffic at the busiest times, providing a clear financial incentive for works to be carried out at less disruptive times.

The government is now inviting applications from authorities wishing to operate 'pioneer' schemes, and has published guidance to interested local authorities. This guidance makes clear that the government is prepared to approve up to three such schemes, in areas where the local authority has already sought to achieve the desired improvements through other means (including road works permit schemes). The government has received an application from Transport for London and this is currently being assessed and considered.

Lane rental charges would need to be targeted on those streets where works cause the greatest disruption, and would need to provide a genuine opportunity for works promoters to avoid charges by carrying out their works at less disruptive times. Evidence from the performance of the 'pioneer' schemes will inform future decisions on whether lane rental should play a wider role.

Any revenues raised from lane rental will have to be used for purposes that will help to reduce the disruption caused by works - for example research and development into disruption-saving techniques and technologies.

At present, the Department is only contemplating a very small number of local 'pilot' schemes, targeted on the very busiest and most congested streets. We cannot yet say where those places will be - this will depend on what proposals are developed by local authorities, and which of these are ultimately approved by the Secretary of State.",guidance,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,,department-for-transport,,,,26-Jan-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/street-works-overrun-charges,Street works overrun charges,When utilities are planning works they must agree with the highway authority how long it will reasonably take to complete them.,"## Summary

When utilities are planning works they must agree with the highway authority how long it will reasonably take to complete them. If they take longer than this, the highway authority may impose an 'overrun charge' - so utilities are incentivised to complete their works on time.

After consultation, the government has announced its decision to raise the amount of this charge, to a daily maximum of £5,000, with higher charges on the fourth and subsequent days. New regulations setting this out will come into force in October 2012. 

The current regulations are: [Street works regulations 2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/303/contents/made).

The charges should be levied as set out in chapter 10 of the [code of practice for the co-ordination of street works and works for road purposes and related matters](/publications/street-works-co-ordination/#cop).

New Street Works Qualifications Regulations come into force on 10th April 2010. These regulations introduce the requirement that supervisors and operatives must be reassessed every five years to confirm that they are still competent before they can re-register and continue to carry out street works. Hence the purpose of this guidance note is to help utility companies, their contractors, local authorities and training providers better understand how the new regulations will affect them. These regulations apply to England only. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are currently developing legislation that will have a similar effect.

The records must also show what kind of apparatus it is, and must be available for inspection at all reasonable hours, and free of charge, to anyone with a legitimate interest in seeing them.

Both Highways Authorities and other statutory undertakers require access to such records in order to safely maintain, reconstruct and improve both the highway and those services situated in the highway on which we all relie. 

## Regulations

Undertakers carrying out street works in England must carry out their works safely and having particular regard to the needs of people with disabilities, as set out in section 65 of the New Roads and Street Works Act.

  * [New Roads and Street Works Act 1991](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/22/contents)

## Code of practice

Undertakers must comply with the Safety at street works and road works code of practice (also known as the red book). The code can also be bought in book form - ISBN 011551958-0.

  * [Safety at street works and road works: a code of practice (PDF, 2300KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/street-works-safety/safety-street-works-code.pdf)

At present, the Code has statutory force only in relation to those carrying out works on behalf of undertakers, not highway authorities, however many authorities expect their staff/contractors to comply with it.

## Consultation

During 2010, the Department consulted on a revision of the safety at street works and road works code of practice, and is currently considering how to proceed in light of the consultation responses.

Where the execution of works involves breaking up or tunnelling under the street, a suitably qualified operative must be present as above and the works must be supervised by a person with a prescribed qualification as a supervisor for the task being carried out.

Following the [Red Tape Challenge initiative, which sought to identify overly bureaucratic and unnecessary regulation](/consultations/gov-20110520), the government is [consulting on scrapping the requirement for operatives and supervisors to hold specific qualifications](/consultations/dft-2012-05/).

Unless and until the regulations are repealed, the current requirements stand. More information about how to comply with them can be found below. 

## How to qualify, register and re-register

These qualifications must be registered on the Street Works Qualifications Register and the holder must be re-assessed every five years.

  * [Street works qualifications: how to qualify, register and re-register](/publications/street-works-qualifications/)

## Obtaining qualifications

The City and Guilds of London Institute, the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the CABWI awarding body are approved for issuing certificates of competence relating to street works. Each of these bodies can provide details of training providers in your area. Those carrying out works for highway authorities should ask the highway authority and make their own judgements about what training is appropriate.

The Traffic Signs (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations and General Directions 2011 came into force on 30 January 2012.

Since the introduction of TSRGD 2002, new signs have been developed in response to the changing needs of traffic authorities, and the requirements of other initiatives. It is mostly those signs that have been routinely authorised that have been prescribed by these Amendment Regulations. In addition, the permitted variants for some existing signs have been expanded to allow for greater flexibility in their use. For those new signs inserted into an existing sign series, their conditions of use apply equally to the new signs as to their existing equivalent - or those which they have replaced. SI 2011 No. 3041 also makes amendments to align TSRGD 2002 with the Traffic Management Act 2004 (""TMA"") - which gave powers to the Highways Agency Traffic Officer Service to provide incident management support to the emergency services on those parts of the motorway and all-purpose trunk road networks approved by the Secretary of State. The previous inconsistency between the two regimes restricted the Traffic Officers from carrying out in full their intended functions under the TMA.

A number of minor corrections have also been made, for example by updating references to British Standards.

The Thameslink Programme is a key element of the Department's strategy for rail and is a major initiative to provide additional capacity and remove passenger bottlenecks on the London commuter network. The programme will allow the operation of longer trains (up to 243m) on the Thameslink network at higher frequencies (up to 24 trains per hour) through the central London's 'core' section.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/the-street-works-ia,The street works (charges for occupation of the highway) (England) regulations 2012,Street works are a significant cause of delay and disruption.,"## Summary 

Street works (ie works by utility companies and others with apparatus in the street) are a significant cause of delay and disruption. On some estimates, congestion resulting from street works costs some £4.3 billion a year in delay costs. However, these costs are borne by society and not by those carrying out the works (ie they are ""externalities""). Works promoters are incentivised to focus on their own costs (to maximise profit), not these wider costs to society. Government intervention is needed to bring works promoters' incentives more into line with those of society at large, focusing on those parts of local road networks where works impose the greatest costs on society.

If you are not using THINK! as part of a communications message, we can advise on using our 'Supporting THINK!' logo.

Research shows that the THINK! brand is strongly linked with road safety in road users' minds. It has also been shown that the brand pricks the conscience of road users, encouraging them to think for themselves about the consequences of their actions on the road.

## Desk research

Review and analysis of existing data and research. This is used to improve our understanding of the behaviour and target audience.

Key findings and analysis are shared with the campaign team, including THINK! marketing, DfT policy colleagues and communication agencies.

Additional primary research by specialist academics is commissioned if necessary.

## Ways in day

The campaign team meets with industry experts and road safety professionals for a structured discussion called a 'ways in day to share insight into the topic and audience. By including a range of participants, we are able to discuss the issue from different viewpoints. The aim is to generate common themes and potential ways to encourage behaviour change for further research. The team looks for incentives and motivating factors as well as barriers to behaviour change that need to be overcome.

## Development of campaign message areas

Using insight generated from the desk research and ways in day, several campaign message areas are developed and explored. These are reviewed and those best supported by the research are taken forward to strategic development research.

## Strategic development research (qualitative research)

The message areas are discussed with focus groups. Groups include individuals who are in the target audience and when required their peers and influencers. Participants are asked questions relating to the specific road user behaviour. Responses are analysed to identify key triggers and motivators which will encourage desired behaviour change.

## Creative brief and creative development

A creative brief is developed and explored by the creative agency. At this stage the communications planning agency will also receive a brief to look at effective communications solutions for this issue and audience.

## Stakeholder update on research and creative brief

Internal and external stakeholders and key partners are updated with campaign progress.

## Creative development research (qualitative research)

The creative agency presents several potential concepts that answer the creative brief. These are presented by an independent research agency to focus groups for discussion. The aim of the discussion is to identify how persuasive and motivating the communications are and the extent to which they will change attitudes and ultimately behaviours. A summary of outputs is presented identifying the strongest creative route or routes.

## Creative production and final creative testing (qualitative)

The creative idea is developed across the range of communications channels which have been recommended by the communications planning agency eg TV, radio or digital. If necessary, further focus groups will be used to test creative work to confirm its effectiveness.

## Campaign launch

The final campaign and a rationale for development are presented to key stakeholders. The campaign goes live.

## Campaign evaluation

Research used to evaluate campaign success is explained in glossary of research terms. Most campaigns are evaluated by analysing changes in attitudes and claimed behaviours.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-drink-driving,THINK! drink driving,Information about THINK! drink driving campaign.,"## Strategy

The THINK! strategy for drink driving is to remind all drivers of the personal consequences of drink driving and that a drink driving conviction can ruin your life.

Our work with partners in the pub environment takes a different approach. It aims to improve the in-pub experience of designated drivers by providing them with promotional offers during their night out.

The THINK! 'Moment of Doubt' campaign for drink driving aims to:

  * increase awareness of the personal consequences of a drink driving conviction. The fine, ban and criminal record are all highlighted.
  * encourage the belief that 1 or 2 drinks before driving is too many and not worth the risk
  * reinforce and build the social stigma around drink driving
  * Offer in-pub solutions to help drivers avoid the temptation to drink alcohol if they know they are going to drive

The 'Moment of Doubt' campaign targets 1-3 pint drink drivers, not drunk drivers, with a particular focus on young men aged 17-29 years old. It doesn't focus on the increased risk of a crash, as our research [drink driving strategic development](/publications/think-research#drink) has found that young men believe:

  * that they are unlikely to crash after 1 or 2 drinks
  * drink drive adverts showing a crash are not relevant to them but to the irresponsible people who drive when drunk
  * that the personal consequences of a drink drive conviction are much more likely to happen to them

We found that the long-term implications of a drink driving conviction, such as imprisonment or a criminal record, a 12 month driving ban or an endorsement that stays on your license for 11 years were new news and more concerning to this audience than the risk of crashing and harming themselves or others.

### Key messages

  * THINK! Don't drink and drive
  * Get caught drink driving and you'll be processed like any other criminal. THINK!
  * Lose your licence for drink driving this Christmas and your car will be out of reach for at least 12 months. THINK!
  * 11 years is a long time to have a drink drive conviction on your licence. THINK!
  * How much will your next round cost you? THINK!
  * Don't let that pint ruin your Christmas. THINK!

### Recent campaign activity

Our most recent drink drive communications campaign in December 2010 remained focused on personal consequences and re-used existing adverts. The media strategy targeted drink drivers at the 'moment of doubt': the moment when they are deciding whether to order another drink. Posters were used within the pub environment. The campaign also included radio advertising, targeted to reach young men on their way out at night, and online search signposting the correct facts on the issue

### Working in partnership

Driver Friendly, which launched in December 2009, was the focus of our partnership activity for Christmas 2010. It aims to improve the in-pub experience of designated drivers by providing them with promotional offers during their night out. We partnered with Coca-Cola and various pub chains to encourage drivers to choose soft drinks on their night out by providing them with a buy one, get one free offer on Coca-Cola and Diet Coke.

We also provide posters for those pubs that want to get involved with the campaign but are unable to support a Driver Friendly promotion.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-drug-drive,THINK! drug driving,Information about THINK! drug driving campaign.,"## Strategy

There are widespread misconceptions about the effects of drugs on driving ability, drug driving laws and police testing methods. The campaign aims to make the facts clear with a longer term aim of making drug driving as socially unacceptable as drink driving amongst the target audience.

Our initial qualitative research in April 2009, looking at potential message territories, confirmed that users of illegal drugs are ambivalent about the potential effects on their driving. They deny that their driving is impaired; they discount the chances of getting caught; and therefore do not take into account the serious consequences either of a crash or a conviction. Most are unaware that drug driving is an offence in its own right and that the police are able to detect them. Drug driving is commonplace amongst friendship groups and can be on either spontaneous or planned occasions.

It was clear that we needed to raise awareness of drug driving as an issue and, with clear non-judgmental communications, provide the facts. The communications aimed to encourage the target audience to face the reality of drug driving, dispelling the myths and ignorance around both impairment and enforcement.

### Key messages

The advertising campaign aims to provoke a questioning of existing beliefs and dispel the myths around drug driving by giving the facts on impairment and enforcement.

  * To be unfit to drive through drugs is an offence in its own right (it is distinct from offences like possession of illegal drugs or dangerous driving).
  * Taking illegal drugs will affect your ability to drive 
  * The police can spot the signs if you're driving under the influence of drugs: 'your eyes will give you away'.
  * Drug drivers face serious penalties which are exactly the same as for drink driving: a minimum 12 month ban, a fine of up to £5,000 and a criminal record with the offence on your licence for 11 years.

### Recent campaign activity

THINK! has actively promoted the 'Don't Drug Drive' message since 2003. The latest campaign, 'Eyes', aired for the first time in August 2009.  
The target audience is all drivers who take drugs and drive with a focus on:

  * 18-35 friendship groups: communications to generate debate
  * All adults: communications to share the facts and raise the profile of drug driving as an issue

TV, online advertising and a website raised awareness and signposted the facts. Media sponsorship, in-game, PR and outdoor posters reinforced the message through trusted and relevant environments.

## Working in partnership

Awareness of impairment through prescription and over-the-counter medicines was also  tackled via national partnership marketing activity with Boots the Pharmacist.

Partnership marketing activity emphasised the importance of taking prescription drugs and medicines and over-the-counter preparations as directed whilst highlighting that some can have an adverse effect on the skills needed to drive safely.  The best way for patients to find out if they are safe to drive is to ask for advice from a doctor, healthcare professional or pharmacist.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-fatigue,THINK! fatigue,Information about the THINK! driving tiredness campaign.,"## Strategy

The March 2008 THINK! driver tiredness campaign was launched as part of our wider driving for work communications. Research has shown that people who drive for work behave in a risky way on the road, including driving while tired.

The fatigue campaign has been developed with the work driver as a key target audience.  
Our tiredness campaign aims to target people from the time they plan their journey to when they are on the road. A key element of the tiredness campaign is radio advertising, which enables us to target people while they are in their cars.

This was supported by advertising in motorway service areas, a partnership marketing campaign and online advertising.

The campaign aims to:

  * encourage drivers to take a 15 minute break every two hours of driving
  * increase awareness of the dangers of driving while tired
  * increase awareness of the signs of driver sleepiness

The target audience is made up of:

  * company car drivers aged under 30
  * company car drivers aged between 30 and 44,
  * HGV/LGV drivers
  * passengers
  * leisure drivers

### Key messages

  * Tiredness Kills. Take a 15 minute break every two hours.
  * Tiredness kills. Make time for a break.
  * Plan your journey to include a 15 minute break every two hours of driving.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-mobiles,THINK! mobile phones,Information about THINK! mobile phone campaign.,"## Strategy

The strategy for mobile phones is based on demonstrating how using a mobile whilst driving impairs your driving ability and puts you and others at risk. Wider responsibility for the issue has also been encouraged by asking callers to hang up if you know they are driving.

The latest national campaign ran in May 2009, with 'caller responsibility' as the lead message within the TV advertisement. In response to emerging trends in texting whilst driving amongst younger drivers, a texting radio advertisement was developed along with sponsorship messages aired during drive time.  
The 'driving challenge' game, launched in June 2008, demonstrates how using a mobile phone at the wheel causes unintentional blindness. The game promotes the message to 'Switch off before you drive off'.

### Key messages

  * Kill the conversation if you know they are driving
  * Switch off before you drive off
  * Doing two things at once whilst driving can cause fatal distraction
  * Don't text and drive

### Recent campaign activity

A multimedia campaign used TV, online, radio and press. The driving challenge game received over 320,000 hits during the 4 week campaign period.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-motorcycling,THINK! motorcycling,Information about THINK! motorcycling campaign.,"## Strategy

The THINK! motorcycling strategy is supported by national communications campaigns aimed at both drivers and motorcyclists. The long term aim is to create empathy between car drivers and motorcyclists, while at the same time raising awareness about the steps that can be taken by both parties to avoid crashes. Car drivers are encouraged to notice motorcyclists on the road by thinking more about the person riding the motorcycle.

Motorcyclists are encouraged to take steps to manage and reduce their own personal risk through wearing appropriate safety gear and taking up further training. The latest THINK! campaign 'Named Riders' ran for the first time in March 2010 and aims to raise awareness of motorcyclists by humanising them in the eyes of drivers.

Motorcyclists have the highest fatality rate per billion miles of any road user group. Despite accounting for less than 1% of total road traffic, motorcyclists account for 22% of all road user deaths [1].

In 2010 around three-quarters (74%) of motorcyclists killed and seriously injured (KSI) occurred in collisions involving another vehicle (usually a car). Two thirds (66%) of these casualties occurred at junctions, often with the other road user failing to look properly [2].

Previous THINK! motorcycle campaigns have provided clear instruction for drivers in certain situations. 'Mirror' in 2001 warned drivers to always look out for motorcyclists in their blind spots. 'How Close' in 2004 encouraged drivers to 'Look, look and look again' at T-Junctions.

The 'Named Riders' campaign aims to take this idea one step further, by exploring the notion that awareness of motorcyclists can be increased by making drivers think more about the person riding the motorcycle.

Research shows that empathy with motorcyclists is important. Drivers with relatives who ride motorcycles have been reported to have fewer collisions with motorcyclists and have better observation skills in regard to motorcycles.

Qualitative research conducted by the Department for Transport also revealed that motorcyclists can seem quite alien to drivers, as their identities are often hidden behind safety helmets. The campaign's message is that motorcyclists are a wide range of people, with names, personalities and families just like car drivers.

A segmentation study has helped define audience groups amongst motorcyclists, with our rider focused activity tailored to those groups most at risk.

  * THINK! BIKE THINK! BIKER
  * Next time you're out driving look out for me

## Recent campaign activity

The campaign ran for the first time in March 2010. TV and cinema were used to establish the campaign and create national awareness. Online was targeted at journey planning sites with a facebook page developed to bring together motorcyclists. The outdoor and radio reinforced the message of the TV and reminded drivers to look out for motorcyclists while on the road. 

A radio-led campaign ran in summer 2011. New radio adverts, upweighted at drive-time, communicated the 'Named Rider' message using new characters. Adverts on petrol station forecourt screens were used successfully for the first time and the TV advert was used for on-demand internet TV. Radio sponsorship and digital display and search advertising was also used. 

A TV-led 'Named Rider' campaign will run 2nd-31st March 2012. 30"" TV adverts will be supported by drive-time radio and petrol station adverts, to communicate key messages to drivers while on the road. 

Public information film 'Perfect Day' highlights the importance of expecting the unexpected. Aimed at a leisure motorcycling audience, it was produced in 2004 and has been one of THINK!'s most popular public information films. A motorcyclist out on a country ride is warned of impending hazards, as everyday road signs turn into words of warning.

## Working in partnership

A partnership marketing campaign communicates road safety messages to motorcyclists though partners, including insurance companies, training providers and retailers. Road safety messages are communicated in situations that are relevant to biking, such as when motorcyclists buy insurance policies and receive their Compulsory Basic Training test certificates. The campaign aims to reduce deaths and injuries amongst motorcyclists by educating them about the steps they can take to manage their own personal risk. Communication materials provided to partners offers advice about protective clothing and gear and includes information about improving skills with the Enhanced Rider Scheme. Since 2010 over 700,000 leaflets, postcards and have been distributed.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-seat-belts,THINK! seat belts,Information about THINK! seat belts campaign.,"## Strategy

The Department for Transport has been promoting the use of seat belts since 1973, long before it became compulsory by law to use one. THINK! is continuing to work on reinforcing the message 'always wear a seat belt' to new generations of drivers and passengers.

The latest campaign 'Three Strikes' re-frames the issue and demonstrates that even at low speeds and on familiar journeys you are vulnerable to a fatal crash. This is done by showing the dramatic consequences of not wearing a seat belt.

The latest campaign, 'Three Strikes' is aimed at all drivers and passengers, with a particular focus on young men and women aged between 17 and 34. This group has the lowest wearing rates combined with the highest accident rate.

Research (conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory for the Department) suggests that the key problem lies with irregular seat belt wearing by the minority of the population. These people make conscious or unconscious decisions whenever they get in the car as to whether or not to wear a set belt. On familiar journeys at low speeds, for example, they are unlikely to see the need to wear a belt.

Endorsed by research as new news to the target audience, the TV advertisement demonstrates the '3 crashes in 1€² and the fatal injuries suffered, even at low speeds:

  * Unbelted driver's vehicle hits another car;
  * His body hits the steering wheel and the windscreen;
  * His internal organs smash against his frame and rupture

### Key message

THINK! Always wear a seat belt.

### Recent campaign activity

'Three strikes' aired for the first time in November 2008 with the latest burst in  February 2010. This latest campaign used a mixture of TV, radio, cinema and outdoor advertising.

### Seat belt crash simulator

An interactive seat belt crash simulator has been developed to support the advertising campaign. This interactive tool shows the type of injury that can happen in a crash, highlighting the risks of not wearing a seat belt. It can be set to different speeds and show different occupants in the car, illustrating the difference between wearing and not wearing a seat belt.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-speed,THINK! Speed,Information about THINK! speed campaign.,"## Urban speed strategy

The THINK! strategy for urban speed  illustrates the dangers of excessive speed  and encourages people to drive at speeds appropriate to the conditions. Even relatively small increases in speed can have significant consequences: It's 30 for a reason.

The 'Live with it' campaign asks drivers to consider the long term impact on their own lives if they kill a child while speeding. The aim  is to make driving at inappropriate and excessive speeds socially unacceptable and illustrates why speed limits, particularly the 30mph limit exist.

A THINK! survey (2009 annual survey) showed that dropping litter was considered more unacceptable (82% of people) than driving at 40mph on a 30mph road (71%).

A combination of engineering and enforcement measures alongside the education campaigns have seen some improvements in speeding behaviours. For example, in 1999 67% of cars exceeded the speed limit on 30mph roads; by 2009 this had reduced to 48%.

### Key messages

  * Kill your speed, or live with it. THINK! - It's 30 for a reason
  * Keep to the speed limit and slow down.
  * If you kill a child while speeding you will have to live with the long-term emotional consequences. These emotional consequences could destroy your life.
  * Speed limits are there for a reason.

### Recent campaign activity

The 'Live with it' campaign first ran in February 2009 with the latest burst in January 2010. TV, cinema and radio were the key media channels used to generate mass awareness and challenge societal norms of the acceptability of speeding.

### Speed - Rural

### Strategy

Although the national speed limit applies on the majority of rural roads, most drivers do not exceed it on them.  The major problem is driving too fast for the conditions. The rural speed component of the THINK! speed campaign focused on the dangers of driving at inappropriate speeds on rural roads. It was particularly targeted at young, male drivers and habitual speeders.

The aim of the campaign was to make young drivers and habitual speeders aware of the risks of driving too fast for the conditions.

**Key messages**

  * Car drivers and passengers are four times more likely to die on a rural road than on an urban road.
  * Don't assume it's safe to break the speed limit on rural roads because there is less traffic.
  * With a clear road ahead you may be tempted to put your foot down. THINK! before you accelerate on rural roads.Junctions or bends can mean you don't see another vehicle until it's too late if you're driving too fast.
  * Drive at a speed suitable for the characteristics of the road and be aware that there may be unexpected hazards, such as blind bends, vehicles coming out of junctions and animals on the road.
  * The national speed limit is not a target speed.

### Recent campaign activity

The last burst of the rural speed part of the THINK! speed campaign ran from November 2006 until March 2008. It focused on the dangers of driving at inappropriate speeds on rural roads.  
It was particularly targeted at young men and habitual speeders who often drive for work.

The rural speed campaign used a mixture of national radio advertising, national ambient advertising (including petrol pumps),posters and national and regional PR.

### Results

In 2009, 81 per cent of people questioned agreed that it is dangerous to drive too fast for the conditions, compared to 60 per cent in 2005.  (THINK! annual survey)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-totr,THINK! tales of the road,Information about: Children: Pedestrians - Tales of the Road campaign.,"## Strategy

Information about THINK!'s child road safety campaign.

To drive understanding of the Green Cross Code and the reasons to follow road safety rules at all times: 'You can come to 'real' harm if you don't put your road safety skills into practice'.

Child road safety communication aims to instill good habits in young people when they start travelling on the road, helping to develop safe road habits and skills that will last for life. 

The Tales of the Road campaign was launched in November 2008 and follows a long tradition of hugely successful road safety campaigns, including the Green Cross Code Man and the Hedgehog family. The campaign is aimed at 6-11 year olds, however the road safety messages it presents are relevant to children of all ages.

A review in 2007/2008, to test the Hedgehog campaign's continuing relevance and impact with the child audience, found that it was too young for 6 to 11 year olds. Research also revealed that road safety is seen as 'un-cool' and something for younger children to 'grow out of'. 

Whilst children could recite the green cross code they were less able to understand why it was important. Following research, the Tales of the Road campaign was developed and aims to make this link by presenting the potential consequences of not translating the code into actions at the roadside.

### Key messages

  * Find a Safe Place to Cross
  * Stop, Look and Listen
  * Be Bright, Be Seen
  * Cycle Safely

Various media channels have been used to communicate with 6-11 year olds:

  * To raise mass awareness of road safety as an important issue amongst 6-11 year olds, their peers, parents and guardians, TV commercials have been shown on key children's TV channels and in cinemas that show PG rated films. At the end of the commercials a call-to-action encourages children to search online for the Tales of the Road website. 
  * The website contains further road safety information for children and parents, including engaging games and videos. The website aims to empower children by encouraging them to explore the consequences
  * Advertorials have been used in BBC magazines such as Doctor Who, Girl Talk and Top of the Pops. In addition Tales of the Road exercise books have been distributed in schools across the country to encourage parents and children to discuss the issue.

### Working in partnership

A range of national partners have delivered tactical support to help us reach and engage children and parents close to the point of danger, for example on the roads travelling to their local cinema.

In addition to the support of local road safety officers, we have partnered with Ready Brek, Bright Kidz, Apollo cinema, and Halfords.

In November 2010 THINK! launched an innovative new partnership campaign with four football clubs located in regions with higher than average casualty rates for children aged six to 11. The partnership programme aims to educate and engage with children in higher risk communities and is supported by local road safety officers and COI News & PR in the regions.

Blackburn Rovers, Sunderland, Leeds United and West Bromwich Albion have been using their after-school clubs, activities in schools and on match days to help six to 11 year olds learn about road safety, using THINK! materials from the 'safe place to cross' toolkit. The initiative focuses on helping children learn how to find safe places to cross the road.

### Results

Tracking research (May 2009) showed Tales of the Road making a considerable impact since launch:

  * 92% agreed the campaign 'made me think about being careful on the road' - v the previous campaign benchmark?
  * 92% agreed 'it is aimed at people my age' - the previous campaign benchmark?
  * 86% agreed 'it could happen to me' - v the previous campaign benchmark?
  * Any KPIS around consequences?

Overall parents also found the campaign appropriate, easy to understand and interesting and half of parents think it will make a big difference. For further details on this piece of research please visit the, [THINK! research](/publications/think-research#child).

The FY10/11 evaluation work is in progress and will be published here in April 2011.

As a condition of acceptance to the UK Tonnage Tax Scheme companies have to agree to provide training for seafarers. They will have to find or fund places for an agreed number of officer trainees according to the size of its fleet and the number of officers employed. This is called the Minimum Training Obligation (MTO).

The MTO falls into two parts, the Core Training Commitment (CTC) and the End of Period Adjustment (EPA).This pack explains how to fill out the forms for CTC and EPA in order to operate a tonnage tax training commitment.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/traffic-signs-manual,Traffic signs manual,Guidance for traffic authorities on the use of traffic signs and road markings.,"## Summary

The Traffic Signs Manual gives guidance on the use of traffic signs and road markings prescribed by the Traffic Signs Regulations and covers England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Revised editions of the manual will be published here as they are released.

The chapters may be purchased in hard copy from [The Stationery Office](http://www.tso.co.uk/bookshop).

## Chapter 1 introduction (ISBN 9780115505591)

Introduction and an outline of the historical, functional and design aspects of signs. The chapter includes sections dealing with the positioning and mounting of signs.

  * [Traffic signs manual chapter 1 introduction (1982) (PDF, 411 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/traffic-signs-manual/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-01.pdf), 18 February 1982, updated 21 October 2004

## Chapter 2 (in draft) informatory signs

Chapter 2 is currently a work in progress. It will contain advice on the design and use of directional signs, and also other informatory signs such as Home Zone signs. Due to the amount of work required to complete Chapter 2, it is intended that interim advice on individual topics will be made available as and when completed.

The current advice on the design and use of directional informatory signs is published in Local Transport Note (LTN) 1/94. Also available is the latest list of Primary Destinations in England, which supersedes the information in LTN 1/94, and guidance on the calculation of x-heights which is site-specific and more accurate than the table in LTN 1/94.

## Chapter 3 regulatory signs (ISBN 9780115529252)

Guidelines on the correct use of regulatory signs prescribed by the Traffic Signs Regulations. These include prohibited turns, waiting and loading restrictions, bus and cycle lanes etc. There is also a comprehensive section dealing with the signing of speed limits.

## Chapter 4 warning signs (ISBN 9780115524110)

Warning signs are used to alert drivers to potential danger ahead. They indicate a need for special caution by road users and may require a reduction in speed or some other manoeuvre. This reprinted edition includes four minor amendments and addition of Appendix A, note 7.

  * [Traffic signs manual chapter 4 warning signs (2004) (PDF, 1024 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/traffic-signs-manual/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-04.pdf), 19 October 2005 updated 12 November 2008

## Chapter 5 road markings (ISBN 9780115524790)

Road markings serve a very important function in conveying to road users information and requirements which might not be possible using upright signs. They have the advantage that they can often be seen when a verge-mounted sign is obscured, and, unlike such signs, they can provide a continuing message.

## AT - Approved tourist symbol drawings

Working drawings available as PDF files now include a group headed ""AT - Approved tourist symbol drawings"". The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002, in Schedule 16, items 24 and 33, make reference to ""approved symbols"". These are tourist attraction symbols which from time to time are introduced by the Department and can be used without special authorisation.

Where a non-prescribed symbol is authorised for a specific attraction it does not necessarily become an approved symbol. Those symbols that are approved will be shown on working drawings prefixed by ""AT"" and made available on this website.

The types appraisal tools listed here include:

## Guidance

This guidance will assist analysts involved in the appraisal transport policies and interventions. The guidance should be seen as a requirement for all projects and studies that require government approval. For projects that do not require government approval this should serve as a best practice guide.

## Software and models

A wide range of appraisal and modelling software packages have been developed to assist analysts.

## Evidence base

Decisions on transport policy must be made in the light of the best possible advice and evidence on their impacts. Investment in all modes of transport and their management must also meet the Department's policy objective to seek good value for money. Research has been conducted on a wide range of topics including transport modelling and appraisal methods.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/transport-business-case,Transport business case,How the Department for Transport assesses the business case for major investments.,"## Introduction

The Department is committed to being open and transparent. This document sets out how the Department assesses the business case for major investments and supports [ministers](http://www.dft.gov.uk/ministers/) as they make decisions on them. This will enable those outside of the Department to understand and engage with what we do. It will also provide scheme promoters and their specialists with comprehensive guidance to make it easier and simpler to understand and engage with our decision making process.

A summary is set out in [The Transport Business Case (PDF, 60 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/transport-business-case/transportbusinesscase.pdf).

## The business case

Ministers consider the evidence presented to them in a business case when making decisions on major investments. The business case is built up over time and contains all the relevant information regarding a proposed scheme investment set out in five cases, consistent with the Treasury Green Book, specifically to show whether a proposal:

  * is supported by a robust **case for change** that fits with wider public policy objectives - strategic case
  * demonstrates **value for money** - economic case
  * is **commercially viable** - commercial case
  * is **financially affordable** - financial case
  * is **achievable** - management case

### Strategic case

The strategic case determines whether or not a project or proposal is needed, either now or in the future. It should demonstrate a robust case for change, ie a clear rationale for making the investment; and strategic fit, how an investment will further the aims and objectives of the organisation. The strategic case is particularly important when decisions are made on a project at an early stage, and should provide a shortlist of options at the **strategic outline case** stage.

  * [The Hints and Tips Guide to Logic Mapping](/publications/logic-mapping-advice-guide/)

### Economic case

The economic case assesses options to identify all their impacts, and the resulting value for money, to fulfil the Treasury's requirements for appraisal and demonstrating value for money in the use of taxpayers' money.

  * [Value for Money guidance](/publications/value-for-money-assessments-guidance/)

### Financial case

The financial case provides evidence on the affordability of the proposal, its funding and technical accounting issues. It includes the financial profile of the different options and the impact of the proposed deal on the Department's budgets and accounts.

  * [The financial case (PDF, 91 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/transport-business-case/financial-case-guidance.pdf)

### Commercial case

The commercial viability of a project or proposal and the procurement strategy that will be used to engage the market is set out and appraised within the commercial case. This ensures that there is a clear understanding of the financial implications of any proposed deal, both in terms of the Department's contractual obligations and associated spend in support of the required services. It also looks for evidence on risk allocation and transfer, contract timescales and implementation timescale.

  * [The commercial case (PDF, 99 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/transport-business-case/commercial-case-guidance.pdf)

### Management case

The management case ensures that the project is deliverable. It tests the project planning, governance structure, risk management, communications and stakeholder management, benefits realisation and assurance. It ensures that there is clarity in the proposal and a clear and agreed understanding of what needs to be done, why, when and how, with measures in place to identify and manage any risks.

## Tools that support business cases

Tools are available to produce evidence that supports all five cases.

### Transport Analysis Guidance (WebTAG)

WebTAG is the Department's website for guidance on the conduct of transport studies. Evidence that supports all five cases is produced using WebTAG and other tools available on these web pages.

### Early Assessment and Sifting Tool (EAST)

EAST is a tool that has been developed to quickly summarise and present evidence on options in a clear and consistent format. It presents relevant, high level, information so that an early view can be taken on how options perform and compare. This tool is new and we welcome feedback on both the tool and the guidance.

## Equality Duty

The public sector Equality Duty came into force on 5th April 2011.

In complying with the Equality Duty, and with the aim of delivering better and more cost-effective policy outcomes, the Department must have due regard to equalities issues, consciously thinking about equality as a matter of course before making decisions, when developing policies and services, and in all departmental planning. This includes looking at evidence, engaging with staff, service users and others to understand the effect of our policies and practices on the whole community.

The development of RTI bus systems has been going on in some areas for many years, one of the biggest examples being London Buses' Countdown system, a new version of which will be rolled out over the next couple of years.

In 2002, the DfT, through the Transport Direct Programme, allocated £20 million to 19 Local Authorities to develop bus real-time information systems. This has acted as a catalyst to further implementations and extensions, as indicated in the annual survey of bus RTI systems, which shows growth in RTI provision each year.

For Transport Direct white labelling is about providing our services through a third party. Often this means our services are provided without our branding. Transport Direct is working with organisations to bring easily accessible and reliable transport information directly to people using the internet for a wide variety of reasons.

Transport Direct's ""White Label"" schemes allow external organisations to present Transport Direct's door-to door planner on their own website, in their own corporate branding. This results in a value-added and seamless 'customer journey' for external organisation whilst enabling Transport Direct to reach people who may not have been aware of the benefits of planning their travel with Transport Direct. The pilot white labelling sites include the BBC, Visit Britain and Directgov.

  * [Contact us](http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportdirect/about/contactus) for more information
  * [A short guide to Transport Direct's white labelling services (PDF, 460 KB)](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/transport-direct-tools/white-label-service.pdf)

## Web services

Transport Direct offers the back office services that are called and used by you. We expose some web services through APIs and send you back XML data for you to display on your own user interface.

The advantage of this is that the user interface and branding is entirely yours. You determine the look and feel of how the information is presented and you can fit in the travel information with the rest of your business processes ensuring the user remains on your site.

For such infrastructure you may need to create a new user interface for the presentation of this information and there maybe a requirement to pay on an ongoing basis per transaction depending on usage.

This solution may be particularly useful to non PC based channels such as the travel content for mobile devices or for interactive TV.

### Particular 'Powered by Transport Direct' web services already available:

  * Door to do journey planning by public transport
  * Scheduled departures and arrivals from stations or stops, with real time information available for all stations and some bus stops
  * Live travel information

### Examples of web services already exposed are illustrated below:

  * Arrival and departure boards from stations and stops boards on a mobile phone or PDA

  * National and regional live travel information for car and public transport on mobile, PDA, and DigiTV
  * Door to door journey itinerary by public transport to medical assessment centre

Transport Direct incurs variable costs in operating the infrastructure to provide the Transport Direct portal services and these will need to be discussed and agreed with the third party.

Please refer to our commissioning located here or contact the Business Service team to discuss this further.

We also have available a Code of Practice which gives details concerning data and agreement with our suppliers. Web services are only available to non-commercial organisations.  A copy is available from the Business Services Team.

## I-frames

IFrames can be used for placing content from another page or website onto a web page. You can position an IFrame on a page and treat it rather like an ordinary graphic. The IFrame (Transport Direct) works independently from the third party web page that displays it. Transport Direct hosts the IFrame, which is one of the differences compared to say page landing.

We have developed a mini Transport Direct journey planner, with results opening in a new tab or browser window.

**<iframe src= ""http://www.transportdirect.info/web2/iframes/iFrameJourneyPlanning.aspx?pid=pdf"" width=330 height=254 scrolling=no>**

NOTE: I-frames support more than simple HTML documents. Users can display everything from HTML, to text documents and even Adobe Acrobat files within the IFrame element.

## Joining up government services - Project Lauren

From August 2006 the Department for Work and Pensions has utilised the Transport Direct back-office processing to generate a tailored journey plan that accompanies the appointment letters for the medical assessments for Incapacity Benefit arranged each year. About 1 million of these letters together with a personalised journey plan are sent out annually. These show how the recipient can travel from their home to the assessment centre. It is expected that this will help to reduce the 20% 'no show' rate for these assessments.

## Transcript

**Presenter 1**

This short video is to let you know that a brand new Transport Statistics Great Britain, the Department for Transport's main statistical compendium, has been published on-line for all to see. And it's jam packed with fascinating facts, fearless figures and staggering statistical trends. So what would you like know about Britain's transport?

**Presenter 2**

Um, OK, I'd like to know which handled more passengers last year - was it Heathrow airport or Waterloo station?

**Presenter 1**

You could say that's a bit of a no brainer because we know that Heathrow is the fourth largest airport in the world in terms of terminal passengers and has more international passengers than any other airport worldwide.

**Presenter 2**

So it must be Heathrow right?

**Presenter 1**

Er:no, last year Waterloo station handled more passengers than Heathrow.

**Presenter 2**

Actually, I've heard that the number of flight arrivals and departures at UK airports has increased ten-fold since 1950, but the number of passengers has increased nearly a hundred-fold. How so?

**Presenter 1**

That's easy, aircraft got a lot bigger.

**Presenter 2**

OK, who gets the most passenger journeys in Britain - is it trains or is it buses? 

**Presenter 1**

Buses win hands down with more than three times the number of passenger journeys than national rail. That's equivalent to 10,000 people getting on a bus across Great Britain every single minute of the day.

**Presenter 2**

Makes you think.

**Presenter 1**

It certainly does. And did you know that local bus services travelled 1.6 billion miles last year.

**Presenter 2**

That's like saying local buses travel to the moon and back 9 times a day - or to the sun and back 8 times a year.

**Presenter 1**

That would be true if buses could drive in space, but they can't. However, I can tell you that bus trips here in Britain only account for 5% of the total distance travelled compared to 9% for rail.

**Presenter 1**

Bet you didn't know that 91 per cent of trains in Great Britain this year arrived at their destinations on time, up from just 79 per cent ten years ago.

**Presenter 1**

Yes I did know actually and now I've got a question for you: What's the same as the distance from London to the South Pole?

**Presenter 2**

Not a clue.

**Presenter 1**

Answer: The total length of the National Rail route in 2010/11 which is 15.8 thousand kilometres.

**Presenter 2**

That's all very well, but you haven't mentioned roads.

**Presenter 1**

Very remiss. OK, let's talk roads. If parked end to end, all the cars in Great Britain would measure nearly 75 thousand miles long.

**Presenter 2**

That's about three times around the equator.

Presenter 1

It certainly is, or another way of looking at that statistic is to assume every motorway had three lanes in both directions and every 'A' road had one lane in both directions, cars would occupy every bit of all motorways and A roads, including the hard shoulders.

**Presenter 2**

That means there'd be no room for lorries.

**Presenter 1**

Quite so:and that would be a problem because since the late-1980s, more than 60 per cent of goods have been moved by road whereas those moved by rail accounted for around 9 per cent of all goods moved.

**Presenter 2**

OK, what about ships then?

**Presenter 1**

What about ships?

**Presenter 2**

We're an island nation and ships are very important.

**Presenter 1**

Good point. UK sea ports handled just over half a billion tonnes of goods in 2010.

**Presenter 2**

Do you know that's more than eight tonnes for every person in the UK - equivalent to a small lorry load?

**Presenter 1**

Is it?

**Presenter 2**

Trust me. And the shipping industry might have made the British Isles heavier last year by over one hundred million tonnes.

**Presenter 1**

How do you figure that out?

**Presenter 2**

Well that's because 312 million tonnes of cargo were landed from ships, while only 199 million tonnes were loaded! I thought everybody knew that!

This is the report of the final evaluation of the joint DfE/DfT Travelling to School Initiative that was launched in 2003, with the aim of reducing car use for the journey to school and allowing more children to take regular exercise.

Since the evaluation work was completed, even more schools have now developed and implemented school travel plans (more than 91 per cent of schools in England had an approved plan by the end of March 2010) and the full School Census dataset for 2009/10 shows a reduction of 2.3 percentage points in the proportion of children travelling to school by car (excluding car share) between 2006/07 and 2009/10.

There was little correlation found between vehicle involvement density (number of vehicles involved in accidents with pedestrians divided by the number of registered vehicles) and the level of noise measured at Type Approval. Additionally there was no evidence of a pattern in vehicle involvement densities when only considering those accidents occurring on 30mph (or slower) roads or where the pedestrian was disabled.

Broadly categorised and anonymised offence data were sourced through Police National Computer (PNC) and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) records. 

This was linked to OTS data to create a unique dataset at each research centre (Transport Safety Research Centre (TSRC) and Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) which allows links between accident causation and offending to be explored (also taking account of road user characteristics). Police data coders were able to confirm the identity of 4,089 road users, and of these 1,910 had at least one offence identified (47%).

Analysis of UK STATS19 database showed accidents with pedestrians are no more likely with electric / hybrid electric vehicles than conventional ones pro-rata to the numbers registered. Visually-impaired people listening to recordings found identifying electric or hybrid electric vehicles more difficult than conventional ones at low speeds and pull away. One of the four conventional vehicles tested was, however, equally quiet. Further analysis of STATS19 was recommended.

## Driving Standards Agency (DSA) twitter policy

DSA's Twitter feed [@dsagovuk](http://www.twitter.com/dsagovuk) will be updated with the latest:

  * News stories
  * Press releases
  * Invitations to consult
  * New content uploaded to our web channels and YouTube

**Why use Twitter to follow DSA?**

There are lots of benefits of choosing to follow DSA on Twitter:

  * you'll be one of the first to find out about **latest DSA news**
  * you can **follow other government organisations**, including Directgov, Business Link and GOV.UK all in one place
  * you can **access Twitter on your mobile/ smart phone/ tablet**, so even if you're not at your computer you can stay up to date
  * you can subscribe to DSA's Twitter **RSS feed** - you can use this to have our latest messages appear in your web browser, email application or even onto your desktop if you have installed an RSS reader; you won't even need to remember to check for new messages!
  * if you have your own website you can include your own latest 'tweets' on your homepage
  * you can 'retweet' messages of the people you're following so your followers can read them too

**Retweeting by DSA**

Occasionally, DSA's twitter accounts receive requests from followers to retweet their messages. Being retweeted by DSA does not imply endorsement.

DSA will retweet if the request:

  * is to publicise an event or activity the follower is undertaking for charity purposes (such as Sport Relief, Children in Need or a local charity)
  * is to publicise a message of congratulation on a follower's pupil (or family member if the follower isn't an ADI) successfully passing their driving test

DSA may also retweet (without being requested) those tweets whose messages are considered relevant to DSA's mission of safe driving or riding for life.

DSA will **not **retweet if the request:

  * asks for endorsement of an activity for commercial gain (such as an event or meeting which charges an entry fee over £5.00)
  * is considered to cause potential embarrassment to DSA

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/uk-national-maritime-security-programme,Brief overview of the UK National Maritime Security Programme,Overview of the United Kingdom's National Maritime Security Programme,"This is an overview of the United Kingdom National Maritime Security Programme which the Department for Transport (DfT) is responsible for. This programme brings together the UK's maritime security regime and the various international and European initiatives to provide a comprehensive protective security regime for UK ships and ports.

## Aim of Maritime Security

The aim of maritime security is to detect and deter security threats and take preventative measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities and to protect from harm passengers, crews, ships and their cargoes, port facilities and the people who work and live in port areas.

## Maritime Operations where Security is Regulated by the DfT

Prior to the attacks on the USA on 11th September 2001, the UK's maritime security regime was provided by the [Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/31/contents).  It applied to passenger vessels and roll-on/roll off services and the ports that serve them. In December 2002 the [International Maritime Organisation](http://www.imo.org/Pages/home.aspx) (IMO) adopted a new international instrument called the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code which was incorporated by the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm) (EC) into Regulation ([EC Regulation 725/2004](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:129:0006:0091:EN:PDF)) (PDF) with implementation dates of: 

  * 1st July 2004 for passenger ships and other ships over 500 tonnes on international voyages and the port facilities that serve them:
  * 1st July 2005 for domestic passenger vessels that go more than 20 nautical miles from land; and
  * 1st July 2007 for certain domestic sea-going passenger vessels and cargo vessels over 500 gross tonnes on domestic voyages.

This Regulation was transposed into UK law using the following statutory instruments: 

  * [Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 1495, The Ship and Port Facility (Security) Regulations 2004](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/1495/pdfs/uksi_20041495_en.pdf); and 
  * [Statutory Instrument 2005 No. 1434, The Ship and Port Facility (Security) (Amendment) Regulations 2005.](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1434/contents/made)

The National Maritime Security Programme covers all commercial maritime operations and by regulation the DfT applies the programme to passenger ships carrying more than twelve passengers and to cargo vessels over 500 gross tonnes on international voyages (including Mobile Offshore Drilling Units) and the port facilities that serve them. With effect from 1st July 2007 we are regulating Class II(A) and Class III domestic passenger ships as well as Class VIII(A)(T) tankers used to transport oil and gas products domestically.

In March 2004, the [International Labour Organisation](http://www.ilo.org/) published a code of practice to enhance security throughout ports and this has been used as the basis for an EC Directive ([EC Directive 65/2005 on enhancing port security](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_310/l_31020051125en00280039.pdf)) which the UK is transposing by way of Regulation.

Port and ship security assessments have been conducted to establish threats and vulnerabilities to port facilities and ships. These assessments are used by operators of ships and port facilities to draw-up ship and port facility security plans in accordance with security instructions issued by the DfT. The plans are subject to approval by the DfT and subject to a programme of compliance inspection by DfT and EC inspectors.

## Security Training

The EC Regulation 275/2004 imposes mandatory training for Port Facility Security Officers, Company and Ship Security Officers. Training can only be delivered by trainers accredited by DfT according to an approved competency framework. An estimated 2000 Port Facility Security Officers, Company and Ship Security Officers have received training [from DfT accredited training providers](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/pfso-approved-training-providers). 

  * A list of accredited [Port Facility Security Officer training providers](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/port-facility-security-officer-training/approved-training-providers.pdf). 
  * To find out about approved Company Security Officer and Ship Security Officer training providers please contact the [Maritime and Coastguard Agency](/mca/), Seafarer Training and Certification Branch on Telephone: 023 80 329 231 (then select option 2). 
  * How to become an accredited [Port Facility Security Officer training provider](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/pfso-approved-training-providers). 

It is the responsibility of the Port Facility Security Officer to ensure that all security staff receive suitable security training so that they can carry out their duties competently. The DfT has developed a Maritime Security Training Manual on the training of security staff to assist Port Facility Security Officers in this duty. The use of the training manual is voluntary but DfT, reserves the right to consider the case for moving to a mandatory regime, at a later date, if it is felt that the overall level of training does not meet with the standards laid down.

## Compliance

DfT is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the requirements placed upon them in the ISPS Code, EC Regulation 275/2004 and the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990.

DfT employs a dedicated team of maritime security compliance inspectors to ensure that all UK ports receiving ISPS ships and all UK ISPS certificated passenger ships are compliant with the UK National Maritime Security Programme.

Inspectors work closely with operators to ensure that the measures set out in approved Port Facility/ Ship Security Plans are operating effectively. They ensure that 'Restricted Areas' within port facilities are clearly marked and that the signage meets the relevant criteria. See the examples in the relevant section which follows. They also carry out both announced and unannounced inspection visits to ships and port facilities, conduct detailed security audits of key operations, attend Port Security Committee meetings and participate in drills, exercises and training events. Compliance activity also includes a programme of covert testing which simulates security incidents and other unlawful acts to test the effectiveness of security measures. Compliance activity is not limited to the UK and targeted inspections of UK passenger ships are carried out at overseas locations. DfT inspectors also participate in a programme of security inspections conducted by the European Commission to ensure Community wide compliance with Regulation 725/2004.

The [Maritime and Coastguard Agency](http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca) (MCA), an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport, is responsible for a similar security compliance programme covering cargo and freight ships.

## Consultation with the Maritime Industry

The National Maritime Security Committee is the focal point for consultation on strategic maritime security matters. It is attended by senior representatives of the port and shipping industries and by other relevant Government Departments and meets twice a year. A Shipping Panel and a Ports Panel for consultation on specific and operational matters have also been established. Consultation with industry also occurs as part of the programme of compliance inspection and through participation in port security committees and regular liaison meetings.

## Contingency Plans and Response to Maritime Security Alerts and Incidents

DfT engages with other Government Departments to provide an assurance that an effective response to maritime threats can be implemented. Specifically, DfT is contributing to security planning for major events and participating in drills and exercises at national, regional and local levels. Maritime contingency plans are kept under review by industry to ensure that they are effective and can be activated at all times. DfT is reviewing its procedures for promptly and accurately promulgating security level changes and supporting information to industry, especially at heightened and critical levels of security. It is also facilitating the introduction of multi-agency threat and risk assessments within ports. One of the challenges facing the programme is to deliver practical security requirements that can be applied by ships and ports at times of a critical security level and sustained by them for the duration that state of alert.

DfT also has oversight of the arrangements for handling Ship Security Alerts (SSA) for UK and Red Ensign Group ships. Under the ISPS Code all ISPS ships have to be fitted with a SSA system which allows them to send an emergency message in the event of a security threat or incident. DfT has developed and implemented robust procedures for receiving SSAs and alerting UK response agencies.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency maintains a number of [Search and Rescue Centres](http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-theroleofhmcoasguard/mcga-hmcgsar-contacts.htm) around the UK.

## International

DfT officials take a leading role in meetings on maritime security at the IMO and work alongside experts from other G8 countries and with the EC. The overall objective is to increase the resilience of the maritime network by creating a more consistent security culture across the world.

The UK played a leading role in the adoption, in October 2005, of the Protocol to the 1988 [Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation](http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/SUA-Treaties.aspx). This Protocol requires parties to criminalise the use of a ship as part of a terrorist act, establishes and international legal basis to counter the  proliferation and trafficking of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and related materials on the high seas.  Once this Protocol enters into force, it will improve the effectiveness of international cooperation to combat terrorist acts at sea in compliance with international law.

An International Strategy for Maritime Security is being developed to increase the resilience of the maritime network by embedding a security culture at all levels in maritime operations. It will increase security awareness, develop skills and capabilities through practical training and, where appropriate, the provision of equipment. The Strategy will depend on working collaboratively with other countries by sharing and encouraging the implementation of best practice. It will also seek to deliver the UK's counter piracy initiatives.

The Strategy will build upon on-going consultations with other Government departments, identifying and prioritising the countries and regions of interest with particular reference to: 

  * Countries within which terrorist activity poses a direct threat or developing threat; 
  * Geographical locations that are of strategic importance to UK trade and shipping patterns; 
  * Countries which give cause for concern as evidenced by a poor record of compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code and; 
  * Countries where the conditions are conducive to receiving such assistance. 

The Strategy will also be informed by the existing network of internationally based personnel attached to the UK Missions, seafarer reports, overseas visits, inspections of UK registered vessels, IMO reports, intelligence and police reports. Bi-lateral discussions will ensure that the Strategy meets the UK requirement as well as serving the needs of a host state.

The Strategy will be kept consistent with the assistance frameworks of other donor countries through liaison with the IMO, with maritime security experts from other G8 countries and with the EC. This will ensure that mutual interests are recognised, maximising the impact of joint initiatives and reducing the risk of duplicating effort. The Strategy will include measures of effectiveness to aid evaluation.

## Security Levels

The ISPS Code provides for three security levels. Most sea areas and foreign ports are set at Level One (normal) but when and where the threat to UK ships is assessed to be higher the DfT will raise the security level for UK and Red Ensign Registered ships to Level Two (heightened). Level Three (exceptional) is reserved for times and locations where the risk of an attack on a UK ship is assessed to be critical. The same system applies to port facilities in the UK and in Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. The maritime threat level and security levels are not published. However, any change to a Security Level is communicated by the DfT to industry as a matter of urgency. These Levels are linked to ship and port facility security plans and dictate the measures that are to be taken along with any specific advice that the DfT may issue.

An assessment of the threat to British interests from international terrorism is provided by the [Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre](https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/joint-terrorism-analysis-centre.html) (JTAC). The Security Levels set by the DfT are determined in consultation with JTAC. The JTAC Threat Levels purely relate to the terrorist threat. In translating the Threat Level to a Security Level the DfT has to consider other factors which affect the risk of a serious attack at sea. This can include an evaluation and verification of the measures that are in place to mitigate the risk of an attack at a particular location. Information on the security situation provided by embassy based [Foreign and Commonwealth Office ](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en)officials can be taken into account in this evaluation.

Unsolicited requests for franchise extensions are made from time to time by train operators. There is a need to apply consistency and fairness in evaluating these requests. This document sets out the process the Department follows if it receives unsolicited franchise extension proposals. This process requires that the proposal first be considered on policy and legal grounds. If the proposal appears to meet the high-level policy and legal requirements, it will then be considered on deliverability, value for money and affordability grounds.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/waterloo-international-terminal,Waterloo International,A brief summary of background and update on plans for Waterloo International Terminal.,"The government is committed to bringing the former International platforms at Waterloo station into domestic use, subject to value for money and affordability constraints. This section sets out the background and explains the current position.

Waterloo International Terminal (WIT) was completed in 1994 and originally owned by Eurostar (UK) Limited, which operated international services out of the terminal between 1994 and 2007. The terminal was specifically designed to accommodate an international train service, where passenger flows to and from platforms were predominantly in one direction at any one time.

Following the transfer of Eurostar services to St. Pancras International in November 2007, the terminal has only been used for occasional charity and corporate events, including the staging of the 'Railway Children' theatrical performance.

Ownership of Waterloo International Terminal was transferred to BRB (Residuary) Limited (BRBR) in 2008. BRBR is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Department for Transport (DfT). Further information can be found on the [BRBR website](http://www.brbr.co.uk/waterloo)

On 23 December 2011 DfT announced that Platform 20 at the former Waterloo International will come back into use from 2014. In May 2012, BRBR appointed Walker Construction to carry out a programme of remedial works to the roof of Waterloo International. The glass panes will be cleaned and the blue steel structure will be cleaned and re-painted in advance of passenger services using the Terminal. 

Waterloo Station is served by trains operated by Stagecoach South West Trains (SSWT). Network Rail is continuing to progress plans to make further use of Waterloo and Waterloo International to cope with future demand.

DfT and BRBR have been in discussion with the developers of the adjacent office block, Elizabeth House, about their imaginative proposal for a wider scheme that integrates with parts of the existing Waterloo International Terminal. Work is underway to assess the practicability of the proposal from a railway operating and capacity point of view. Discussions continue with the developer pending the outcome of any planning application regarding Elizabeth House.",guidance,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,,department-for-transport,,,,27-Jun-2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Railways Act 2005 places a statutory duty on the government to set out every five years how much public expenditure it wishes to devote to rail and specify what it wants the railway to deliver, notably in relation to safety, reliability and capacity.  The formal statement, including the High Level Output Specification and Statement of funds available, is contained within the white paper.  It covers the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2014.

The white paper looks at the potential future challenges for the railway over a 30-year horizon.  It identifies three long-term agendas for government and the rail industry working in partnership: increasing the capacity of the railway, delivering a quality service for passengers, and fulfilling rail's environmental potential.

Hard copies of the white paper (priced £25) may be requested by telephoning TSO [0870 600 5522] or through the Parliamentary hotline _Lo-call_ [0845 7 023474]. A free summary booklet may be requested by telephoning [0870 1226 236].

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/winter-resilience-in-transport,Winter Resilience in transport: an assessment of the case for additional investment,"Culmination of the review by the Chief Economists and Scientists of DfT, DECC and DEFRA.","## Summary

The previous Secretary of State for Transport commissioned a review by the Chief Economists and Scientists of DfT, DECC and DEFRA in 2011 to establish if there was a case for greater investment in measures to improve winter resilience. This report is the culmination of that review. Whilst it suggests that the balance of investment is broadly correct, it identifies a number of areas where further work would be helpful. For example, there is a strong case for introducing third rail heating to reduce disruption on the rail network to the south of London. The report also suggests to further explore a number of promising measures to keep roads open and safe during severe winter weather, and to examine the case for increased investment in the Met Office's supercomputing capacity.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-area-office-review,DSA's review of area office functions,This paper recommends that DSA should close its Cardiff area office. The Cardiff office lease arrangement expires in September 2012.,"This paper recommends that DSA should close its Cardiff area office.

The demand for administrative support work in DSA is decreasing. This is due to several factors that include:

  * the growing take-up of online services through the introduction of new functionality and better ways of working, in line with the government's aim of making digital channels the default platform for accessing government services
  * initiatives such as a move to a total facilities management contract and business process reviews of activities, such as finance, that drive out efficiencies and generate spare capacity in staff resource

In the next two years accommodation occupancy across the three main administrative sites (Nottingham, Newcastle and Cardiff) will become progressively inefficient as the need for administration support diminishes. Six options have been evaluated after discussion with the TUS, and the recommendation to close the Cardiff office and absorb work at the other two sites provides the greatest operational financial savings over a ten year period.

The Cardiff office lease arrangement expires in September 2012. Closure provides the best opportunity to rationalise locations, secure efficiency gains and realise the expected benefits of planned initiatives.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-delegated-driving-examiner-research,Delegated driving examiner research,Read DSA’s research about drivers who pass the passenger carrying vehicle test under delegated examiner arrangements.,"The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999 allow MoD, Police and Fire and Rescue Services to appoint examiners to undertake driving licence acquisition tests for their staff. Such appointments must be approved by the Secretary of State for Transport to enable the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) on their behalf to ensure that all tests are conducted to a fair and uniform standard nationally. The Regulations also allow the Secretary of State for Transport to appoint Passenger Carrying Vehicle (PCV) driving examiners for bus and coach operators.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that drivers passing the PCV test under delegated arrangements have an equivalent safety record following commencement of professional driving as those passing the PCV practical tst with a DSA examiner.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-equality-diversity-statement,DSA equality and diversity statement,DSA's diversity strategy is aimed at positioning the agency as a market leader in the field of diversity and outlines the position that it is now in.,"The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) recognises valuing and embracing equality and diversity is key to its continued success and a well motivated workforce. 

All staff and customers will experience fair and equal treatment which will not be influenced by their: 

  * age 
  * disability 
  * gender reassignment 
  * pregnancy and maternity 
  * race (including ethnic or national origin, colour or nationality) 
  * religion or belief (including lack of belief)

DSA encourages a situation where staff and customers are treated with dignity and respect. DSA believes in continuously evaluating its policies and procedures to help ensure they do not directly or indirectly adversely impact on staff or customers.

Discrimination will not be tolerated.

## Equality duty

DSA will ensure it shows due regard to The Equality Act 2010 and the underpinning public sector equality duty to ensure we meet our equality duty. DSA understands how meeting this helps towards delivering equality of opportunity for all as well as meeting its key business objectives.

This includes having due regard to the need to: 

  * eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct prohibited by the Equality Act 2010 
  * advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it 
  * foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it

## Recruitment

One of the strongest indicators of an inclusive and fair system is the way DSA recruits. DSA will ensure its recruitment practices continue to meet the needs of its equality duty.

## Responding to the needs of customers

DSA will continue to recognise the benefits of its diverse customer base in assisting with the development of its policies and services. Understanding the diverse needs of its customers helps DSA to formulate policies and services to address these. 

## Creating an inclusive culture

Ensure equality and diversity continues to be mainstreamed into policy development, business procedures and service delivery. This helps an inclusive culture, particularly by the way staff interact with each other and customers. This leads to a higher level of satisfaction and commitment and greater success towards meeting DSA's objectives.",policy-papers,,,Transparency,driving-standards-agency,,,,9-Dec-2004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-filming-recording-driving-tests-policy,DSA's policy for filming or recording of driving tests,DSA has a policy generally of not allowing the recording or filming of driving tests. Find out what DSA does and does not allow.,"The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) has a policy generally of not allowing the recording or filming of driving tests.

For the purpose of this policy, 'recording' means the use of any type of audio or visual recording equipment and covers all theory and practical driving and riding tests. This includes recording inside the test vehicle or outside - for example, during a motorcycle test.

DSA allows:

  * filming by external parties - for example, TV production crews - with DSA's permission, with DSA having editorial control of the film, conducted for promotional or educational programmes; further conditions apply and all applications to film tests for media purposes should be made through DSA's press office
  * filming by DSA officials for promotional or educational purposes for internal or external customers and with the permission of all involved

DSA does not allow any other recording of driving tests.

If an examiner knows a test is to be recorded without DSA permission, the test will not proceed.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-history-driver-licensing,History of driver licensing,History of driver licensing,"Driver licences were first introduced in Britain by the Motor Car Act, 1903, purely as a means of identifying vehicles and their drivers.

All motor vehicles had to be registered, display registration marks and be licensed annually at a cost of 20 shillings (£1).

The fee for the first driving licence, which was obtained over the counter at Post Offices, was five shillings (25p).

Failure to sign your driving licence with your 'ordinary signature' could lead to a fine of up to £5.

In 1921 there were only 1 million drivers in Britain. By 1939 this figure had risen to 3 million. But it was only during the 1960s, when cars became more affordable, that motoring really took off.

In 1973 the number of drivers had risen to about 20 million and a centralised computer-based licensing system was brought in to cope with the huge increase in demand for both driver and vehicle licences.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-history-highway-code,History of the Highway Code,"Find out about the history of the Highway Code, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The Highway Code is essential reading for everyone.","The Highway Code celebrated its 80th birthday in 2011.

Hundreds of thousands are sold each year, ensuring that it never leaves the bestseller lists.

In fact it is one of the few books in print that can lay claim to saving thousands of lives.

When it was first launched in 1931 there were just 2.3 million motor vehicles in Great Britain, yet over 7,000 people were killed in road accidents each year.

Today there are more than 27 million vehicles on our roads but, thanks to greater public awareness, advances in technology and the introduction of British Summertime, only half the number of road deaths occur.

However, that still leaves plenty of room for improvement.

Some things have not changed over the years: the very first edition of The Highway Code urged all road users to be careful and considerate towards others, putting safety first.

However, other aspects of the code have changed considerably. For example, in 1931 mirrors were not even mentioned and drivers were advised to sound their horn when overtaking.

Nowadays, advice on how to cross the road fills a whole chapter, but in the early days it only merited a paragraph.

On the other hand, more than a third of the original 24-page booklet described the various hand signals the police and road users should use, compared to the single page given to the subject in the current edition.

## The first edition

The 1931 edition:

  * cost one old penny
  * was the only one to carry advertisements, for the AA, The Autocar magazine, The Motorcycle magazine, Castrol Motor Oil, BP, Motor Union Insurance and the RAC
  * contained 18 pages of advice, compared to 93 pages in the 1999 edition
  * included advice to drivers of horse drawn vehicles to 'rotate the whip above the head; then incline the whip to the right or left to show the direction in which the turn is to be made.'

Since those early days, regular revisions of the Code have reflected changes in technology and developments in traffic management and road safety.

## Road signs

Diagrams of road signs - just ten signs in all - were first seen in the second edition, as was a warning about the dangers of driving when affected by alcohol or fatigue.

## Stopping distances

Stopping distances made their first appearance in the third edition, along with new sections giving hints on driving and cycling.

## In colour

The 1954 Highway Code, complemented by brand new colour illustrations, gave over the back cover to first aid guidance, while the expanded traffic signs section contained the first triangular warning signs.

## Motorways

The arrival of motorways in the late 1950s led to the inclusion, in the fifth edition, of a new section on motorway driving. It explained such things as how to use exit slip roads and advising drivers to avoid drowsiness by stretching their legs at the parking or service areas.

## Photographs and 3D illustrations

By the sixth edition in 1968 photographs and 3D illustrations had been included to help make rules clear and the price had risen from 6 old pence to 1 shilling and 3 pence (1/3d). After decimalisation reprinted editions cost just 6 new pence.

## Green Cross Code

The 70-page 1978 edition introduced the Green Cross Code for pedestrians and the new orange badges for the disabled. Prompted by soaring car crime statistics, the amended version contained advice on vehicle security.

## Theory test

The 1990s saw a new format taller booklet and the inclusion of a section geared to the new driving theory test, which in the current edition has now become part of the Code itself.

## Getting social

In 2011 the Highway Code joined social networking websites Twitter and Facebook to share reminders of the rules of the road.

## The app

In May 2012 The Official Highway Code app for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad was launched, priced £3.99.",promotional-material,making-roads-safer,,,driving-standards-agency,driving-test-history,,,11-Mar-2005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-history-lorry-bus-driver-testing,History of lorry and bus driver testing,Find out about the history of lorry and bus driver testing in Great Britain.,"From 1935, when driving tests were first introduced, to the outbreak of World War Two in 1939, every driver of a goods vehicle over three tons unladen weight had to have a vocational licence.

To hold one of these, you had to pass a special driving test. Yet from the end of the war until the late 1960s, anyone over the age of 21 who held an ordinary driving licence was allowed to drive a heavy goods vehicle (HGV).

The 1960s saw an increase in road haulage and vehicle sizes, and an accompanying decrease in standards of safety and vehicle maintenance.

This prompted the reintroduction of HGV driver testing, with much more stringent standards than the original pre-war test.

In September 2008 Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) was introduced for bus and coach drivers.

Driver CPC for lorry drivers was introduced in September 2009.",promotional-material,making-roads-safer,,,driving-standards-agency,driving-test-history,,,11-Mar-2005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-history-motorcycle-testing,History of motorcycle testing,Find out about the history of motorcycle rider testing in Great Britain.,"In the early days of motoring, one licence covered both cars and motorcycles use.

## 1931

First edition of the Highway Code published including advice for motorcycle riders.

## 1 Jun 1935

Compulsory testing brought in for all drivers and riders who started driving on or after 1 April 1934:

  * around 246,000 candidates applied
  * the pass rate is 63%
  * 250 examiners taking at least nine, and up to sixteen, half-hour driving tests each day 

Those passing the motorcycling test did not need to take another test to drive a car. The test was conducted by the examiner positioning themselves at a point where they could observe the motorcyclist's riding such as beside a common or in a city square.

In the case of sidecar outfits or three-wheelers, the examiner might have accompanied the rider.

Examiners were responsible for handling the booking of driving tests. There were no driving test centres; examiners met candidates at pre-arranged locations such as car parks or railway stations.

## 1939

Testing of all vehicles was suspended during World War II. Examiners were re-deployed to traffic duties and supervision of fuel rationing.

## 1946

Testing resumed after the war.

## 1947

The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations placed motorcyclists in their own licence group, but testing remained virtually unchanged until the 1960s.

## 19 Oct 1956

The test fee doubled from 10 shillings to £1.

## 1956

Testing suspended during Suez crisis and resumed after a year. Learners allowed to drive or ride and examiners help administer petrol rations.

## 1961

Learner riders were restricted to machines of no more than 250cc capacity in order to deal with the high number of motorcycling fatalities.

## 1963

New grouping systems were introduced for driving tests and driving licences and a distinction was made between the test of competence and the test of fitness (the visual acuity test/number plate test).

Mopeds were placed in their own vehicle group for driving test purposes.

## 1965

The application form for a driving or motorcycle licence was revised. The medical standard for eye sight changed. The distance from which a driving or motorcycle test candidate must be able read a number plate changed to 67 feet for 3? inch high characters.

## 1972

The minimum age for riders of motorcycles was increased from 16 to 17 years. The minimum age for moped riders remained at 16 years.

## 1976

A new Driving Training Establishment opened in Cardington, Bedfordshire. Newly recruited examiners undergo four weeks of initial training.

## 1981

The government produced a three point package of changes:

  1. the maximum size of learner machines was reduced to 125cc
  2. provisional motorcycling licence entitlement was limited to two years
  3. A two-part test was introduced - the intention is to reduce accidents by steering learners to take training with approved organisations on suitable motorcycles. The first part of test included some basic off-road motorcycle control exercises - usually conducted at Large Goods Vehicle (LGV) centres. The second part included the usual on-road riding.

## 1989

A new accompanied motorcycle test was introduced. Prompted by concerns about accident figures, the old-style 'Part 2' motorcycle test, where the examiner stands by the roadside, was replaced by the new, more demanding 'accompanied' test'. The examiner followed the candidate on a motorcycle or in a car and maintained radio contact with the candidate during the test.

## 1990

The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) is created as an executive agency of the Department for Transport.

Provisional licence holders prevented from carrying pillion passengers.  
Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) was introduced for all new learner riders of motorcycles and mopeds. CBT comprises five elements including a minimum two-hour accompanied road ride. The course is designed to ensure new riders have a basic level of competence before they are allowed to ride on public roads displaying L plates and continue the learning process.

## 1996

Introduction of specific theory tests for car drivers and motorcyclists.

## 1997

Introduction of additional licence categories and tests for learners aged over 21 years riding larger motorcycles (Direct Access Scheme) and small motorcycles.

New riders under 21 years restricted to riding machines of 125cc whilst learning. Once they pass the test they are then restricted to riding machines of 25kw (33bhp) for two years. After this period they can ride any size of motorcycle.

A minimum wait between tests of the same category is introduced for unsuccessful motorcycle riders set at ten days to ensure they had sufficient time to retrain.

## 2001

Changes to regulations obliged people with full car licence to take mandatory training (CBT) before riding a moped.

## 14 Nov 2002

A hazard perception element was introduced into the motorcycle theory test; this uses video clips to test candidates' awareness of hazards on the road.

## April 2009

A new two part modular motorcycle test introduced enabling the UK to comply with the EU second Directive requiring new and more demanding manoeuvres to be tested.

### Module** 1**

Module 1 contains the specified manoeuvres element of the test which is conducted off-road. It includes exercises designed to assess the rider's ability to control their machine safely, including avoidance and emergency stop exercises.

### Module 2

Module 2 includes an eyesight test and 30 minutes of on-road riding, assessing the rider's ability to safely interact with other road users.

This report describes the background, methods and results of a pilot study of independent driving, situational judgement questions and changes to the turn in the road exercise.

The results showed an acceptance by candidates and instructors for the inclusion of independent driving but concerns were raised about the impact of the route design on the performance of candidates.

## On the road to independence

This report describes a larger scale trial of the independent driving exercises, designed to address the concerns arising in the pilot study.

The results showed that with careful route design, candidates were better able to complete the independent driving tasks without significant increases in the driving faults observed.

Additional qualitative research found wide spread support for inclusion of the exercises in the practical driving test. It is on the basis of these results that the changes to the practical driving test were introduced.

  * Mr Bean was the first person to pass the driving test in 1935: fact! But it's not that Mr Bean, it was Mr J Beene who paid a grand total of 37p (7d / 6p in old money) to take the test
  * there were no test centres in 1935 so you had to arrange to meet the examiner somewhere like a post office, train station or town hall
  * the test was suspended for the duration of World War Two and didn't resume until 1 November 1946

http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-welsh-language-scheme,DSA's Welsh language scheme,"This scheme describes how DSA will give effect, so far as is both appropriate in the circumstances and reasonably practicable, to the principle established by the Welsh Language Act that the Welsh and English languages should be treated on a basis of equality.","Under the Welsh Language Act 1993 every public body providing services to the public in Wales has to prepare a scheme setting out how it will provide those services in Welsh.

This is DSA's scheme.

It describes how DSA will give effect, so far as is both appropriate in the circumstances and reasonably practicable, to the principle established by the Welsh Language Act that, in the conduct of public business and the administration of justice in Wales, the Welsh and English languages should be treated on a basis of equality.

The scheme covers the services that DSA provides to the public in Wales.

Further information about the scope and purpose of Welsh language schemes can be found in the Welsh Language Board's guidelines at [www.welsh-language-board.org.uk](http://www.welsh-language-board.org.uk).
