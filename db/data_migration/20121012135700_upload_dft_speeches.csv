But we also recognise that there can be unavoidable consequences for those who live closest to any route put forward for such a network, particularly when they urgently need to sell their property.

It is for this reason that the Government is of the view that an Exceptional Hardship Scheme is absolutely necessary to help those who are most directly and immediately affected.

Details of such how such an Exceptional Hardship Scheme might operate were published for consultation on 11 March. In order to limit the delay for those in most urgent need of financial assistance, this consultation was due to run for ten weeks, ending on 20 May.

However, having received representations which argued that ten weeks is not sufficient to allow all those with an interest to have the fullest possible opportunity to comment on these proposals, I announced last week that the deadline for that consultation would be extended by four weeks to 17 June.

In taking this decision, I have been aware of its implications for those in the most urgent need. Therefore, without prejudice to the outcome of the consultation, I have asked my officials to put shadow arrangements in place so that, should a decision be taken to proceed with the Scheme, applications can begin to be considered immediately.

By bringing forward the timescale for applications in this way, I hope to minimise uncertainty for those affected and ensure that payments can be made as quickly as possible wherever appropriate.

Of course, anyone whose application is considered under such shadow arrangements will also have a right of appeal once the formal scheme is up and running.

Furthermore, once a route is chosen and safeguarded by the Government, eligible property owners will have access to statutory blight compensation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20100608,Review of the motorcycle test,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** I am announcing today a review of motorcycle tests in Great Britain. The new two-part motorcycle test that was introduced in April 2009 has clearly led to some concern amongst motorcycle groups, particularly about the safety of the off-road module 1 part of the test and about the difficulty of accessing the limited number of off-road test centres.  The new test was introduced in order to meet the requirements of the second EU Directive on driving licences. While most elements in the module 1 test are required by the Directive, there may be scope for us to make some changes to the way in which the test is carried out.

We will be working with the motorcycle community and road safety groups to look again at the current form of the motorcycle test.  This review will look at the manoeuvres carried out in both modules 1 (off-road) and 2 (on-road) and whether these manoeuvres could safely be conducted in the on-road test.

The review will also look at other related motorcycle testing and training issues, including the options for training and testing for progressive access under the third driving licence directive and how any changes relate to wider proposals to improve motorcycle training and testing.

We are inviting views from members of the public, motorcycle riders, trainers, road safety groups and others on what aspects of the motorcycle test they want us to look at, including how and where they think motorcycle testing might best and most safely be carried out.  Views should be submitted to the Department for Transport ([RUSD4consultation@dft.gsi.gov.uk)](mailto:RUSD4consultation@dft.gsi.gov.uk)) by 31 July.  We aim to conclude the review by the autumn.

The draft regulations were silent on the practice of differential pay for seafarers recruited abroad and therefore, if they had been approved by Parliament in their published form, the practice of differential pay for seafarers recruited abroad would have ended.

Those who are likely to be affected by the final regulations were invited to submit evidence-based financial estimates of the likely impact of either:

(a) outlawing the practice of differential pay altogether; or,

(b) continuing to allow the payment of differential rates of pay to seafarers but only where such differentiation would not operate to the disadvantage of nationals from an EU, EEA state (or any other state whose nationals are entitled to corresponding rights under EU law) nor that of seafarers recruited in Great Britain, and the difference in rates would correspond to a difference in the cost of living in the places where the seafarers respectively habitually reside.

The then Government subsequently announced a review of the evidence submitted would be commissioned.

Today I am publishing the findings of the review commissioned by the previous Government copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House and are available on the DfT website (www.dft.gov.uk).

The issues raised by those who submitted evidence are important and the Government wishes to provide interested parties the opportunity to comment on this review of evidence before reaching conclusions on how to proceed. I am therefore inviting comments on this review over the next two weeks. I am especially keen to hear from those parties who previously submitted evidence.

Once I have considered the matter further, I will report back to Parliament.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20100610,Transport: Local Authority Major Schemes,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** The Government has made clear its most urgent priority is to tackle the UK's record budget deficit, in order to restore confidence in the economy and support the recovery.  The Department for Transport will play a full part in the spending review which will be reporting in the autumn.  Only once the Government's spending review has been concluded will the Department for Transport be in a position to identify those major investments that can be supported.

The Government has also made a commitment - as set out in the Coalition Agreement - to reform the way decisions are made on which transport projects are prioritised.

Given the uncertainties which both of these factors create, and in view of the likely budgetary constraints, and the consequent likelihood that not all schemes will be able to proceed on their planned timetable, it would be inappropriate for the Department to continue to invest time and resources on development of schemes at the same rate as before.  Local Authorities will also wish to consider carefully whether investing further time and resources in developing such schemes ahead of the Spending Review is justified.  They should not assume that schemes prioritised under the previous Government's Regional Funding Allocations (RFA) process will be funded to the previous published levels.

I am therefore today taking steps to help avoid unnecessary expenditure, whilst the Government considers its transport priorities:

  * The previous Major Schemes Guidance for Local Authorities and associated approval processes are being suspended until further notice.
  * All schemes that were granted Conditional Approval or Programme Entry by the previous Government will be reviewed as part of the spending review. Until then, the Government can give no assurances on funding support for any of these schemes.
  * Ministers will postpone decisions on scheme orders for schemes requiring DfT funding, but consideration will be given if there are alternative funding sources. Similarly, public inquiries on schemes requiring DfT funding will generally be postponed and no further inquiries will be scheduled, but inquiries will be allowed to proceed if there are alternative funding sources.

The previous Major Schemes Guidance for Local Authorities is today being replaced with new interim guidance to Local Authorities, which has been placed in the Libraries of the House and will be available on the Department for Transport website (www.dft.gov.uk) today. Officials will also be writing to affected local authorities.

The Government will aim to provide a firm indication on the way forward later this year once the spending review is complete.

The report has over fifty recommendations which would require action by the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland or by the general lighthouse authorities (GLAs) of both countries. Some of them are self evidently sensible and straightforward to implement.  The GLAs are already doing so in a number of cases.  Others would be more challenging and take longer.

I intend to give everyone with an interest a further opportunity to make their views known and I will take account of any opinions that are expressed before reaching conclusions on how the recommendations should be implemented.

Key recommendations in the report include:

  * Creating a GLA joint strategic board to drive efficiencies;
  * Using an annual target reduction calculator (RPI - x%) for GLA running costs;
  * Developing a ""roadmap"" with the Irish Government on the financing of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, setting out an incentivised financial model which retains the all-Ireland body while allowing its costs within the Republic of Ireland to be covered wholly from Irish sources; and
  * Changing the structure and scope of light dues.

I should like to invite comments on these and any other findings of the report by 15 July 2010 before coming to any conclusions.  I then intend to publish decisions on what action needs to be taken and, if necessary, to consult further on specific proposals.

The report has been posted on the Department's website (www.dft.gov.uk) and copies are available in the Libraries of the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20100614,Rail value for money study,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** I welcome the publication of the scoping study report from Sir Roy McNulty's review of Value for Money on the railway. While I recognise that this report represents a very early stage in the work of Sir Roy and his team, I believe that the report represents an important step in identifying the factors that drive up the cost of the UK railway.

Given the scale of the fiscal deficit the UK is facing, it is vital that public spending be subject to scrutiny to ensure that it represents value for money. We must adjust to a world in which our aspirations for a successful railway have to be met from within a much tighter public spending envelope. As the scoping study highlights, there is evidence that the cost of the UK railway is relatively high, both in historic terms, and by comparison with other European railways.

The next stage will be to look at options for ensuring public investment in the railways is delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible. I have therefore asked Sir Roy to accelerate key elements of his work so that his preliminary findings can inform the decisions on public spending that will have to be taken in the autumn.

I would call upon all stakeholders in the rail industry to offer Sir Roy and his team their fullest co-operation. By driving efficiencies on the railway, we can ensure that passengers and freight users get the railway they need at a price which Government and taxpayers can afford.

Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House and are available on the Departments website (www.dft.gov.uk).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20100615,South East Airports Task Force,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** The Government believes that aviation makes a vital contribution to the economy of this country and to the lives of our citizens. The aviation sector contributes some £11bn to GDP and directly employs some 200,000 people. Its true economic value is much greater than this when we consider the importance of air travel to the global economy and to UK competitiveness. But we cannot simply allow growth to continue at the levels it has in the past. Doing so risks unacceptable consequences in terms of noise and local air quality, quite apart from the global impacts in terms of CO2 emissions.

We need to start a new chapter in aviation policy - one that promotes a competitive aviation industry, supporting UK economic growth, whilst recognising the need for restraint.  We have already begun that by making clear our opposition to adding yet more runways at Heathrow, Stansted or Gatwick. Instead, we must explore different ways in which to improve the efficiency of these key components of our national transport infrastructure.

Improving the passenger experience is at the heart of this Government's vision for UK aviation. We announced in the Queen's Speech our intention to reform the economic regulation of airports to deliver better outcomes for passengers. But I believe that there are also other things that Government and the industry can do together, and so today I am announcing the establishment of a South East Airports Task Force with key players from across the industry to explore the scope for other measures to help make the most of existing airport infrastructure and improve conditions for all users. The group will be chaired by the Minister of State, the Rt Hon Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers) and its initial focus will be on action at our three biggest airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.

I am confident that, by working closely with the aviation sector, alongside our regulatory reforms, this will help deliver improvements for all.

This consultation will provide industry partners with the opportunity to comment on the Government's approach to rail franchising and whether bidders for longer franchises would be able to offer investment in improvements to trains and services. It will also allow the industry to set out its proposals for improving the efficiency and value for money of rail franchises, for both taxpayers and fare payers. I will set out further details to the House in due course.

To enable the next Greater Anglia and Essex Thameside franchises - which are currently in the process of being re-let - to fully reflect the changes resulting from this review of policy the competitions for these franchises, which were started in January 2010, are to be cancelled.

It is currently expected that a new competition for the Greater Anglia franchise will be advertised by the end of the year, after the consultation responses have been considered, with the Essex Thameside franchise following in Autumn 2011.

It is also expected that there will be some consequent changes to the procurement timescales previously published for the InterCity East Coast franchise. Rail services will continue to run as normal on all affected franchises. A Prior Information Notice (PIN) setting out the Department's proposed future rail franchising programme will be issued in due course.

A wide-ranging **EU-US Air Transport Agreement** came into effect in April 2008. Its provisions included removal of all commercial restrictions on flights between the EU and the US); and improved cooperation in safety, security, competition, consumer protection and the environment. Negotiations for ""Stage 2"" of the Agreement began in May 2008. The negotiations have led to a solid outcome, which includes recognition of the importance of greater access for airlines to global capital markets and a widening of the reach of the agreement in environmental matters. I propose to agree to the signature of the Stage 2 Agreement at the Council. A signing ceremony is planned for later in the day.

The Commission will present to the Council its report on the EU response to the consequences of the recent **volcanic ash cloud** on air transport. The Commission's report was produced at the request of an extraordinary session of the Transport Council on 4 May.  The Commission is expected to provide an overview of the technical work that has been taking place at national, European and global level to increase the understanding of safe flying in areas affected by ash and to examine how the rules and guidance might be improved. My intention would be to encourage further cooperation in this area in order to ensure that airlines and passengers are subjected to the minimum of disruption internationally should there be another eruption. The issue of financial assistance for companies affected by the ash disruption may arise. While recognising the significant financial impact of lost revenue and/or passenger assistance, I do not intend to raise any expectations and would propose to emphasise that budgetary constraints make any support from UK taxpayers unlikely.

The Council will be asked to adopt Conclusions following the Commission Communication on **Urban Mobility**, which set out an Action Plan. We support the principles of the Action Plan, and the opportunity to spread best practice across the Community. The Conclusions take a common sense approach by making use wherever possible, of existing institutions, programmes and instruments. I welcome the recognition that intelligent transport systems offer strategic options for improving urban mobility as this is an area that the UK has focussed on. I also welcome the focus in the Conclusions on research of all kinds on clean and energy-efficient vehicles. It is important that that the Action Plan does not lead to further legislation, and that cities and city regions retain the freedom to pursue and implement locally relevant solutions.

There will be a policy debate on the role of transport in the ""**Europe 2020 strategy** for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth"".  No conclusions are expected and no decisions will be taken.  I will take the opportunity to highlight how EU transport policy can and should promote jobs and growth.

Notable among the AOB items is a report from the Commission on **security scanners**. This report concludes that security scanners at airports could help to reinforce passenger security and where deployed should be covered by common EU wide standards covering performance, fundamental rights and health provisions. Scanners are currently deployed at several UK airports.

The Council adopted a Decision to sign a protocol amending the **2007 Air Transport Agreement with the United States**. I noted the UK's support for the decision and that we would look forward to further cooperation and reform in the future under the mechanisms set down in the agreement, particularly with regard to the liberalisation of investment opportunities in airline operators. The Protocol itself was signed by the Presidency on behalf of the EU, by Ministers on behalf of the Member States, and by the US Ambassador to Luxembourg and the US Assistant Transportation Secretary for Aviation on behalf of the US.

The Commission updated Ministers on the work requested by the extraordinary Transport Council on 4 May on the topic of the **volcanic ash cloud**. The Commission reported that there was ongoing technical work in refining the limit values that would provide a definition of a safe environment for flying and on adopting new mechanisms and approaches for coordinating action at the EU level. Guidance had been produced on how passenger rights legislation should be applied and work was ongoing with respect to a European mobility plan.  In respect of state aid, the Commission noted that the Treaty opens the possibility for Member States to compensate airlines, but to date no Member State had in fact made a formal request for state aid clearance, nor had any draft proposals been presented to the Commission. I noted that more technical work was needed to refine limit values and that there was a need to maintain pressure in order to establish safe tolerance levels. I further noted that there was an opportunity to pool efforts for conducting research flights. Although we acknowledged the losses suffered by business as a result of this event, I indicated that in current circumstances, with constrained budgets, the UK would not wish to raise expectations that financial assistance would be forthcoming. Whilst passenger protection during the closure of airspace was vital, I asked the Commission to review Regulation 261/2004, on passenger rights, in light of the European Court of Justice decision of November 2009 which has resulted in some perverse and disproportionate consequences with respect to the financial impact on airlines of having to compensate passengers for delayed flights.

Council Conclusions were adopted unanimously on the Commission's **Urban Mobility Action Plan**, which sets out a framework of initiatives to promote integrated policies and optimise urban mobility. The Conclusions support the development of sustainable urban mobility policies, while maintaining the principle of subsidiarity.

The Presidency noted that the European Council had recently agreed its **Europe 2020 strategy for growth**, and invited views on how transport could contribute to the strategy. The Commission stated that, although it did not feature prominently in the Europe 2020 package, transport was important for growth, and the strategy provided a suitable basis for the Commission to take forward its work on transport.  A White Paper would be forthcoming before the end of the year which would include views on intelligent transport systems, multi-modality, and alternative sources of funding. I noted that the UK's overarching national objectives for transport were to support economic growth and contribute to the 2020 carbon reduction targets. Additionally, I stressed the importance of having competitive transport services, and the need to avoid excessive regulatory burdens on business.

Following the Detroit terrorist incident at the end of 2009, the Commission presented its Communication on the use of **security scanners** at EU airports. I stated that EU restrictions which currently prevented the effective and efficient use of security scanners needed to be removed and urged the Commission to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals to facilitate this, in order to allow scanners to be used as a primary method of screening at UK airports.

The Commission informed the Council of the adoption of the **Galileo** Action Plan in June and that the focus would now be on coordination of efforts, with regulatory proposals only being bought forward if necessary.

During a further discussion on the Galileo programme, I informed Ministers that, following the success of a joint bid with France to host the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre, the UK would be withdrawing its bid to host the Galileo Supervisory Authority and would instead support the bid of the Czech Republic to host this entity in Prague. I also informed Ministers that the UK would not support any additional funding requests for the Galileo programme, within the current financial perspective.

The Commission announced that it intended to withdraw the proposal to exclude self-employed drivers from the scope of the 2002 **Road Transport Working Time** **Directive** following the recent rejection of the proposals by the European Parliament. With support form the other delegations, I urged the Commission to continue with efforts to seek a compromise solution with the Parliament.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20100706,Rolling Stock,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** I am today announcing that a decision on the future of the Intercity Express Programme (IEP) will be made at the same time as the spending review announcement in October.  IEP would provide new trains for the East Coast and Great Western Main Lines, and is separate from the High Speed 2 proposal.  IEP is a complex programme which has interdependencies with several other major rail projects, and as expenditure on rail projects will be re-assessed in the context of the spending review, it would be irresponsible to make a decision on IEP in isolation at this time.

Agility Trains was appointed preferred bidder to build and maintain the new IEP fleet in February 2009.  In February of this year, the previous Government invited Sir Andrew Foster, former head of the Audit Commission, to provide an independent assessment of the value for money of the Intercity Express Programme and the credibility and the value for money of any alternatives which meet the Programme's objectives.  Sir Andrew presented his report to me at the end of June, and I am publishing it today.

Sir Andrew suggests that the Intercity Express proposition is ""positive and attractive"" in a number of ways. He suggests that the PFI-style funding arrangement is novel and well-aligned in terms of financial incentives, faster acceleration and longer carriages would have a positive impact on network and passenger capacity, and the specification has also taken network sustainability and environmental imperatives seriously.

Sir Andrew does express some doubts over the technical feasibility of the new bi-mode trains, but I see this as a lesser issue.  Whilst this is a clearly challenging project, I have been impressed by Agility's willingness to take on the commercial risk for the reliability and performance of the trains.  In addition, Hitachi - Agility's major shareholder - has already demonstrated its commitment to delivering high quality products to the UK rail market through its development and deployment of the new Javelin trains for High Speed 1.

Whilst Sir Andrew's report acknowledges that the Programme has exceeded the Department's value for money thresholds, the value for money has declined over time, and Sir Andrew suggests that he is not convinced that all of the viable alternatives to the programme have been assessed alongside it on an equal footing.  Therefore the Government will use the period up until the spending review is completed to give further consideration to the alternatives to IEP.

Sir Andrew also expressed some concern over the widespread scepticism of the Programme within the rail industry.  He suggests that the need for commercial confidentiality in the much-delayed procurement process - that was run by the previous administration - has resulted in insufficient communication between the Department and the key stakeholders.  Despite involving the rail industry in the procurement process, a sense of disengagement developed, which could have been avoided.

This Government fully recognises these concerns and we are already acting on them.  In future, we will involve the rail industry more fully in decision making.  We have already invited the industry to contribute to Sir Roy McNulty's review of costs in the rail sector.  In addition, we have announced that we will consult widely on franchising policy, allowing the industry to suggest ways to improve the efficiency and value for money of rail franchises, for both taxpayers and farepayers.  We will also work with the rail industry to consider how best, in future, to procure and implement major investments in rolling stock, as well as how best to implement the changes that follow from the spending review.

Finally, it remains for me to thank Sir Andrew Foster, Agility Trains and those from the across the rail industry who contributed to the Review.

Sir Andrew Foster's report is available from the House of Commons library and from the Department for Transport's website.

These regulations were laid before the House on 9 April 2010.

There is no doubt that ship-to-ship transfers require some form of regulation because of their potential for damage to the UK's seas and coasts. The Regulations endeavour to address this in two separate and distinct ways:

  * they prohibit ship-to-ship transfers and bunkering operations outside harbour authority waters; and
  * they put in place a legislative regime for assessing and licensing harbour authorities which propose to allow ship-to-ship transfers in their waters.

I am aware that there have been concerns expressed by industry and by some honourable Members about some aspects of these Regulations. I am also conscious that there are those who support the Regulations in their current form.

The key objective has to be to ensure that the Regulations are fit for purpose and do not apply additional, unnecessary burdens to industry.

I am also committed to ensuring that the policy and legislative processes associated with the passage of the Regulations are entirely proper and fully consistent with the principles of better regulation.

Accordingly, I am today announcing a review of the Regulations. I would like to invite all interested parties - including honourable Members, local authorities, industry and environmental non-governmental organisations - to set out their views on the Regulations by 30th September. I also intend to meet some of the interested parties.

To allow the necessary time for this review to be carried out, I am today laying before the House a Statutory Instrument, the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (SI 2010 No.1769), which defers the entry into force of the Regulations from 1 October to 1 April 2011.

In line with this commitment, I am therefore publishing this statement within 12 months of the previous statement, which was published on July 16th 2009, and set out below the information required to fulfil the commitment to Parliament:

Total funding amounts provided to Crossrail Limited by the Department for Transport and TfL in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period (22nd July 2008 to 29th May 2010)
£773,769,000

Expenditure incurred (including committed spend not yet paid out) by Crossrail Limited in relation to the construction of Crossrail in the period (31st May 2009 to 29th May 2010) (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases)
£963,976,000

Total expenditure incurred (including committed spend not yet paid out) by Crossrail Limited in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period (22nd July 2008 to 29th May 2010) (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases)
£1,160,779,000

The Amounts realised by the disposal of any land or property for the purposes of the construction of Crossrail by the Secretary of State, TfL or Crossrail Limited in the period covered by the statement
Nil

The numbers above are drawn from Crossrail Limited's accounts.  The expenditure incurred amount includes both committed spend that has not yet been paid out and monies already paid out in the relevant periods.

Crossrail will support economic growth for London and the UK, and, as the Coalition Agreement made clear, is supported by Government.   Recent work to update the business case indicates that the project will generate high value for money.

At this relatively early stage in the project, with several of the main construction contracts currently out to tender, Crossrail Limited continues to forecast a range of possible outturn costs which indicate that the project can be delivered within the available funding.  To ensure that these costs remain affordable and that every pound spent on Crossrail offers value for money, Crossrail Limited are engaged in an ongoing programme of value engineering, risk avoidance and mitigation and indirect cost reduction.  I expect this work to report later in the year.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20100721,Economic Regulation of Airports,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** In the Queen's Speech the Government announced its intention to reform the framework for the economic regulation of airports. Today I am announcing the direction of our proposals.

The Government has previously announced that it does not support the construction of a third runway at Heathrow airport nor additional runways at either Stansted or Gatwick airports. Instead, it is the Government's intention to make these airports better and not bigger, delivering better outcomes for passengers without additional runways.

To deliver operational improvements at these airports I have recently announced the creation of the South East Airports Taskforce and that group has already begun its work.

I plan to introduce a new set of duties for the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) economic regulation of airports which will put the interests of passengers unambiguously at the heart of the regime. Under these proposals the CAA's primary duty will be to promote the interests of existing and future passengers.

Where regulation is necessary it must be proportionate. Airports vary in size and market power and therefore should not be subject to identical regulation. To allow economic regulation to be used in a targeted way I plan to introduce a new licensing regime to be applied only to airports with substantial market power and where such regulation adds real value. We presently expect this regime will apply initially to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports.

Airports subject to economic regulation by the CAA need to operate efficiently and effectively and I am clear that significant investment will be required if passengers' expectations are to be met. The proposals I am outlining today are to reform the framework for airport economic regulation to drive passenger-focussed investment in better facilities such as baggage handling equipment or terminal improvements. These proposals will allow economic regulation to be used in a more targeted way to deliver passengers' priorities and will remove unnecessary bureaucracy and political involvement from the regulatory process.

In order to ensure the financial resilience of UK airports, I will also introduce a supplementary financing duty and minimum credit worthiness requirements as well as ring fencing conditions where there is a net benefit in introducing such measures, and require the preparation of plans for continuity of service should an airport operator get into financial difficulties.

All too often, regulation can crowd out commercial incentives to make improvements, so I intend to provide the CAA with the option, where appropriate, to respond to anti-competitive behaviour using competition law powers rather than by applying its regulatory tools. I propose to bring airport economic regulation into line with other regulated sectors of the economy by granting the CAA concurrent powers with the Office of Fair Trading. This will enable the CAA to investigate and remedy anti-competitive behaviour in the provision of airport services at airports, and where appropriate to make referrals to the Competition Commission for investigation. Supporting competition in this way may, in time, allow the regulator to gradually loosen its regulatory grip.

Effective enforcement is critical to the efficiency of any regulatory system. To bring airport economic regulation into line with other regulated sectors of the economy I plan to introduce civil sanctions, including financial penalties, for the CAA to enforce licence conditions, creating a more efficient and responsive enforcement regime.

An efficient and credible appeals mechanism is necessary to ensure a regulator is accountable. Under the current regime, persons with sufficient interest may apply for judicial review of the CAA's decisions. The industry is unanimous in its view that judicial review alone is an unsuitable process for providing accountability. The option to apply for judicial review must remain, but I propose to introduce a system for merit-based appeals, to a body with relevant expertise, against certain decisions taken by the regulator. This new system will apply to appeals against decisions on which airports should be regulated and to appeals arising out of contested licence modifications, including new price controls.

After careful consideration, I have decided not to give a new remit to Passenger Focus to represent air passengers as had previously been proposed. Whilst it is important to have strong passenger representation, this is not the time to be make additional structural changes which would add to the regulatory burden on industry. I will therefore be exploring options for strengthening existing passenger representation arrangements.

I am also publishing today analysis of responses to further consultations on certain detailed provisions relating to financial resilience of operators and to concurrency powers. Copies have been placed in the library of the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20100721,Port of Dover,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** In January 2010, Dover Harbour Board published its proposals for a transfer scheme to enable it to privatise the Port of Dover so that, among other things, it could access private investment to build capacity at the port.  There was a statutory period of eight weeks for those with an interest to make representations about the transfer scheme, which ended on 25 March.

Since publishing its proposals in January, Dover Harbour Board has continued to discuss the proposed transfer scheme and the associated proposals for a Port of Dover Community Trust and Employee Share Ownership Trust with local organisations, including the local councils, as well as port users.  In recognition of this and the importance of the issue to the people of Dover, I have therefore decided to ask Dover Harbour Board to publish more information about the nature and likely impact of the scheme than was available at the time of the statutory consultation, including details of the Port of Dover Community Trust and Employee Share Ownership Trust.  This will give those organisations and individuals with an interest in the Port of Dover a further and better-informed opportunity to comment on Dover Harbour Board's proposals.

Notices inviting written representations will be published in local newspapers, and those who have already written to the Department, including the local councils, local organisations and port users, are welcome to write again and provide any further comments they may have.

The period for further comments will run until Friday 27 August 2010.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20100721b,The re-designed Vehicle Registration Certificate and 'Buyer Beware' Consumer Protection Initiative,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** I am today announcing the immediate introduction of a re-designed and more secure Registration Certificate (V5C) for vehicles in the United Kingdom. The new documents will be issued from 15 August 2010 for all newly registered vehicles and when there are changes to an existing registration, such as a change of keeper or address.

I am introducing the new certificate as a matter of urgency to help protect motorists from vehicle crime following the theft of a number of blank certificates in 2006. Vehicles have been stolen, cloned and sold to consumers using some of the stolen V5Cs. Buyers often mistakenly believe the V5C to be proof of ownership of a vehicle. This is not the case. The new V5C, which is a different colour, will make it clear the document is not proof of ownership and will help draw to an end the threat posed by the stolen documents.  This will help buyers to protect themselves.

From July 2011, the new-style V5C will be issued to all remaining vehicles when they are next re-licensed or declared to be off the road. Their existing blue V5C will remain valid until it is replaced and at that time we will not be asking for the old V5C to be returned.

DVLA and the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland are also promoting a ""Buyer Beware"" message aimed at helping motorists understand the risks around stolen or cloned vehicles. In particular, buyers need to ask for proof of ownership, for example a bill of sale.  The DirectGov website now has a list of checks that should be carried out by prospective buyers when looking to buy a second-hand vehicle. The list is printable, to make it easy to use when going to inspect a vehicle.

DVLA and DVA are working in partnership with industry leaders and consumer champions to make the DirectGov and NI Direct websites a central point for expert knowledge on how to avoid being sold a stolen vehicle. While no one can guarantee that motorists won't ever become the victims of vehicle crime, DVLA and DVA believe they can help individuals to make the right decisions by helping them understand the risks involved.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20100726,High Speed 2: Exceptional Hardship Scheme,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** The Government is committed to the establishment of a high speed rail network as part of its programme of measures to create a low carbon economy.  However, in developing plans for a new high speed line, both I and my predecessor as Secretary of State for Transport have been mindful of their potential impact on those who live on or close to the proposed line of route.

It was for this reason that the previous Government launched a consultation on a potential Exceptional Hardship Scheme to provide assistance for those who have been most severely and immediately affected by the preferred route option for a new line between London and the West Midlands set out in the recent report by HS2 Ltd.  This consultation closed on 17 June.  Around 4,500 responses were received.  This Statement sets out my response.

It is clear from the responses to the consultation that there is overwhelming support for a scheme to be introduced to provide assistance for those most severely affected by HS2 Ltd's proposed line. I can therefore confirm that an Exceptional Hardship Scheme will be introduced, and that it will be open to applications from Friday 20 August.

The introduction of the scheme recognises the unique nature of the proposed line, which is only the second high speed rail project to be considered in the UK and which differs significantly from its predecessor in terms of its design, operation and potential market. It should therefore not be taken as setting any precedent for future infrastructure schemes.

Respondents to the consultation also made many suggestions as to how the terms of the scheme might be altered. I have considered these and have made the following changes from the scheme put forward for consultation. Firstly, the scheme will be widened to include owner-occupiers of agricultural units and commercial properties with an annual rateable value not exceeding £34,800; this brings it in line with the blight provisions under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Secondly, the scheme will also be able to cover properties recently inherited following a bereavement and repossessed properties that the original owner urgently requires the bank or other lender to sell to realise some value.

A number of respondents asked for the scheme to be extended to properties over tunnelled sections of the proposed line of route. It is my view, however, that any blighting effects over tunnels are likely to be limited, and this is reinforced by the additional information note on the effects of tunnelling which HS2 Ltd has published on its website today. However, I accept that there is a need to make special provision in relation to properties close to the proposed entrances and exits of tunnels. I have therefore decided to extend the scheme to cover these properties.

Finally, I have decided that the panel which makes recommendations to me on applications to the scheme should have a majority of independent members, although this will not be the case for the shadow panel announced in my Written Ministerial Statement of 27 May.

In other respects, the scheme will operate as set out in the consultation document.  In particular, the scheme will apply only to properties on or in the vicinity of HS2 Ltd's route option 3. HS2 Ltd's report makes a clear recommendation and it is therefore my view that assistance of this kind should be focused on this route, where the blight impacts will be most severe. It is also my conclusion that, to minimise the risk of blight spreading as a result of a scheme of this kind, it should be limited to those who have a pressing need to sell and who would otherwise experience exceptional hardship.

A large proportion of consultation responses also raised issues in relation to longer-term provision to address blight. If a decision is taken following public consultation to proceed with a new high speed line and to safeguard the route that it would follow, statutory blight arrangements would come into force covering those properties which would have to be acquired in order to build or operate the new line. However, many respondents suggested that additional provision would be needed to cover those properties which would not have to be acquired but which might still be seriously affected by the construction or operation of the line. Respondents also made a number of proposals for how such provision might be structured. I am aware that provision of this kind has been made in respect of a number of previous schemes in both the public and private sectors.

I am mindful of the importance of appropriate longer-term arrangements to assist those who would be most seriously affected by a new line. I agree that some additional provision over and above the statutory blight regime will be needed to achieve this, and it is therefore my intention that this should be put in place, if and when a decision is taken to safeguard a route.

The specific issues raised in response to the consultation, particularly in respect of the different models for operating such arrangements, are complex and require detailed consideration. I have therefore asked my officials to provide me with further advice on options for the terms and conditions of such additional provision and how it should operate. I will report to Parliament on my proposed way forward in the light of the Spending Review outcome and before public consultation on the Government's strategy for high speed rail and the route of any new high speed line.

I have placed copies of the analysis of responses to the consultation and a list of frequently asked questions about the scheme in the Libraries of the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20100726a,Government response to the interim report on salt supply and use,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** For two winters in a row, severe weather has caused significant disruption for transport in this country.  The cost to the economy and the disruption to the public has been significant, and there has been a level of dissatisfaction and confusion about the response by government at both local and national level.  This is unacceptable and must be resolved before the next winter season. An independent review of the transport sector's response to last winter was commissioned by my predecessor as Secretary of State and I have asked David Quarmby CBE, who leads it, to continue that work.

The review panel's interim report is being published today; and I am grateful to David Quarmby, Brian Smith, Chris Green, and those who have supported them, for their thoughtful and forthright analysis and recommendations. Copies of the interim report have been placed in the library of the House.

The interim report concentrates on actions that can be taken by local and national highways authorities, salt suppliers, government and others to improve resilience of the highways network for the coming winter as well as some longer term actions.  There is much in this report on which all of these groups will want to act urgently to ensure that disruptions to highway networks are minimised in the event of another severe winter.

For my part, I have tasked my officials to take forward, as a matter of priority, the recommendations relating to the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency.  I welcome the recommendation that the Highways Agency should build up a strategic salt supply of last resort for 2010/11, given the particular re-stocking challenges for local highway authorities for this coming winter.  I have instructed the Highways Agency immediately to consider how arrangements could be implemented to source a volume of imported salt to establish and manage national strategic stockpiles of up to 250,000 tonnes.

In taking action to create strategic salt reserves for the 2010/11 winter season, the Highways Agency will clearly need to take account of the constraints imposed by the availability of salt from overseas and immediate storage facilities.

It is important, as the Review makes clear, that local highway authorities do not treat the possibility of such a supply as absolving them from the need to make appropriate provision for their highway networks. I urge local highway authorities to take forward the recommendations that relate to them.

The experience of last winter has shown that adopting standards and methods which reduce the utilisation of salt without compromising effectiveness will both reduce vulnerability to salt supply problems and reduce the cost to the local highway authority.  It is therefore vital that authorities share best practice across the sector and  my Department will discuss with the UK Roads Liaison Group how best we can support this aim for this winter and in the longer term.

Although highway authorities have a duty, as far as practicable, to keep their highways clear of snow and ice, it was clear from last winter that many members of the public were keen to show community spirit in clearing the footways outside their property.  It was equally clear, however, that many were uncertain of their rights and liabilities if they were to act in this way.

The interim report recommends (as does a recent report by the Local Government Association) that the Department for Transport should produce a brief guide to help the public understand this area of the law.  I have tasked my officials to produce this by the end of October, not in the spirit of laying down what people should or should not do, but in the spirit of empowering those who wish to act in a neighbourly way.

The Review Panel's work is not at an end. As well as undertaking further analysis to support longer term actions to improve resilience in salt supply, they are also turning their attention to other transport modes.  I look forward to receiving their final report, which they intend to publish in the autumn, in due course.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20100726,Marine aids to navigation,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** Following my request for comments on the report by Atkins consultants entitled ""Assessment of the provision of marine aids to navigation around the United Kingdom and Ireland"" in June 2010 (Official Report 10 June 2010: Column 35WS), I have received replies from 18 organisations and individuals.  I wish now to inform the House of the steps the Government intends to take to ensure the continuing delivery of a high quality aids to navigation service to ensure the safety of all of those using our seas, which also minimises the burdens on those paying light dues.

The Atkins report makes some 52 recommendations covering technical matters, corporate governance, efficiencies & synergies, light dues charges, the general lighthouse fund and Anglo-Irish issues.  Key recommendations include:

- Creating a general lighthouse authority joint strategic board to drive efficiencies;

- Using an annual target reduction calculator (RPI - x%) for GLA running costs;

- Developing a timetable with the Irish Government on the financing of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, setting out an incentivised financial model which retains the all-Ireland body while allowing its costs within the Republic of Ireland to be covered wholly from Irish sources; and

- Changing the structure and scope of light dues.

In the light of the responses received, the Government has decided to endorse the formation of the joint strategic board with the clear objective of co-ordinating and directing work between the three general lighthouse authorities to achieve maximum efficiencies and improvements in the delivery of aids to navigation.  To take the work of the joint strategic board forward as quickly as possible I have asked Chris Bourne, a non-executive director of Trinity House, to act as Chair of the Board.  In his role as Chair of the joint strategic board Mr Bourne will take an independent and impartial view of the issues, and will report to me on the Board's achievements.  His extensive shipping background and knowledge of the work of the general lighthouse authorities make him an excellent choice for this role.  In the longer term, the Government will look at the appointment of a Chair for the joint strategic board from outside the three general lighthouse authorities.

The Government has also decided that it is right, particularly in current economic circumstances, to ask the general lighthouse authorities to deliver reductions in their running costs below the level on inflation and welcomes the commitment by the general lighthouse authorities to delivering this challenge.  The precise target will be agreed with the general lighthouse authorities alongside the development of their corporate plans and budgets for 2011-14 that are submitted to me for consideration in the autumn.

In this difficult economic period the Government also wishes to provide long term stability and reassurance, both for light dues payers in the level of charges they face and for the general lighthouse authorities so they can plan effectively with budgetary stability.  The responses received to my request for comments on the Atkins recommendations suggest that there is little appetite to make major changes to the structure and scope of light dues payable by ships visiting our shores.  I do not therefore intend to change the basis on which light dues are currently charged, although I will continue to work with all interested parties to seek an equitable means of ensuing that all those who benefit from the provision and supervision of marine aids to navigation by the general lighthouse authorities pay towards their provision where it is viable, practicable and economic to do so.

The Government also believes a solution needs to be found as soon as possible to the imbalance of funding for aids to navigation in the Republic of Ireland.  I have written to the Irish Minister of Transport; it is my intention to conclude a negotiated agreement with the Irish government and to implement that agreement as quickly as is reasonably possible thereafter.

In addition to supporting the construction of a third runway, a number of additional decisions were taken relating to operations at the airport.

This Government has already made its position clear in rejecting the case for a third runway, and opposing new runways at London's other main airports - Gatwick and Stansted.  I now wish to outline the Government's position in relation to those additional operational decisions.

I can confirm that we remain firmly committed to retaining runway alternation and will not approve the introduction of mixed mode operations at Heathrow.  This Government believes that any potential benefits mixed mode might bring to the airport are outweighed by the negative impact such operations would have on local communities.

Operating procedures known as westerly preference, early morning runway alternation and night-time rotation of easterly/westerly preference have also all brought noise mitigation benefits to local communities.  This Government does not intend to revisit previous decisions taken in relation to these procedures and they will continue to operate as they do now.

The previous Government's decisions in 2009 also included a commitment to end the Cranford agreement.  This decision was based on the desire to distribute noise more fairly around the airport and extend the benefits of runway alternation to communities under the flight paths during periods of easterly winds.  We support that objective and do not intend to re-open the decision.  A number of infrastructure and operational changes by BAA and NATS are needed to implement this decision. The airport operator, BAA, is currently developing proposals for ending the Cranford agreement with a view to confirming the necessary works by the end of this year.  I will look to BAA to ensure that proper consideration is given to appropriate mitigation and compensation measures for those likely to be affected by the proposals.

The Equality Act 2010 contains new provisions which will, when commenced, tighten the law by placing duties on taxi and PHV drivers to provide assistance to people in wheelchairs. Before these duties come into force, we are making provision for those drivers who themselves suffer from a condition which makes it difficult to provide assistance, to apply for an exemption from these duties. Drivers will be able to apply for these exemptions from October. I have today published guidance to local authorities and drivers to this effect so that they can prepare accordingly.

Also from October, the sections of the Equality Act 2010 which oblige taxi and PHV drivers and PHV operators to carry guide dogs will be commenced. This obligation is already prescribed in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, so in practice there will be no change for drivers. However, the guidance I have published today will reassure drivers and licensing authorities that any existing Exemption Notices which refer to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will still be valid once the Equality Act sections are commenced.

The guidance notes have been published on the Department's website and will be brought to the attention of all the taxi/licensing authorities and the principal taxi/PHV organisations.

The Strategic National Corridors were established in 2009 to define the network over which the largest proportion of strategic traffic - that is traffic travelling between the ten largest urban areas, ten busiest ports and seven busiest airports in England moves around the country. The original definition also provided for connectivity between the four nations of the United Kingdom, but there was no specific provision for connecting capital cities.

The Government believes that the routes linking Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to the nearest urban strategic destination should be recognised for the strategic connectivity that they provide.  For this reason I am today launching a consultation on proposals to change the definition, to explicitly include links with our capital cities.

As a result of this change we believe that two routes would be identified as having national significance: namely the A1 between its junction with the A19 north of Newcastle, and the Scottish Border, providing a defined link to Edinburgh; and a route between Bootle and the Twelve Quays Ferry Terminal in Birkenhead, providing connectivity with Belfast.  We have also set out information about alternatives to these routes which I invite consultees to consider.  Routes linking the network with Cardiff were identified in 2009.

The consultation does not include any specific proposals to increase the capacity of these routes. However, the Department is considering the nature of the problems on the A1 north of Newcastle so that, as part of the spending review, Ministers will be in a position to consider these alongside other priorities in identifying those schemes and programmes that it will be proceeding with, consistent with resources available and the Government's objectives.

I am pleased to announce that the consultation will run for a period of twelve weeks, and invite everybody with an interest in the roads potentially affected to take part.  A consultation document and instructions for responding can be found on the Department's website and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.

Consistent with the Government's de-regulation agenda I have decided not to make eco-driving training a mandatory part of the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence at this time.

I will instead respond to industry assurances that they have the will to increase uptake of eco-driving training without direct Government intervention, and will encourage and support industry-led initiatives to improve fuel efficiency and tackle carbon emissions, of which a number have emerged as a result of this consultation.

In 2012 the Department will review the level of uptake of eco-driving training and fuel savings resulting both from these industry-led initiatives and from voluntary uptake as part of the Driver CPC and will re-consider the case for Government intervention.

I have placed copies of the consultation response document and associated impact assessment in the Libraries of House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101014,EU Transport Council,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** The first Transport Council of the Belgian Presidency will take place in Luxembourg on 15 October.

The Council will be asked to reach a Political Agreement on the Directive amending Directive 1999/62 on charging of heavy goods vehicles (the **Eurovignette Directive**). The Directive governs the taxation of lorries, including rules for the charging of access to road infrastructure where Member States choose to do this.  The proposed amendments include the removal of references to mandatory hypothecation of revenues and proposals to allow charges to be set flexibly within the overall cap to reflect externalities in areas and at times when there is congestion.  We strongly support the former and believe the latter represents an acceptable approach to dealing with congestion.  The amendments will also include proposals to allow Member States discretion not to include goods vehicles weighing less than 12 tonnes in charging schemes - reflecting the fact that few such vehicles are involved in international traffic - and some limitation of the Commission's powers to propose amendments to minimum and maximum rates using delegated acts.  In particular the Commission's power to increase the minimum rates of lorry circulation taxes, such as goods vehicle VED, has been removed. We support both of these proposals

We remain concerned that this Directive, which impacts on national charging regimes and hence on tax, rests on a transport legal base and will continue to press our position that these issues should be agreed by unanimity.  We will also continue to press the case for increasing maximum daily rates for time-based charging.

There will be an exchange of views on **Strategy and the Future of Transport 2010-2020**. This will give Ministers an opportunity to set out their position on issues expected to be covered in the European Commission's forthcoming White Paper on transport policy, prior to the more detailed analysis which will follow publication. I will reiterate the UK's commitment to climate change mitigation measures in transport and to better regulation across the board.

The Council will be asked to adopt a mandate authorising the Commission to open **negotiations with Brazil** on a comprehensive air transport agreement. The Government supports the opening of negotiations on such an agreement.

Under AOB the Commission will present their recent **legislative proposal to recast the first rail package**.  There will be no substantive discussion.

Among items for adoption without debate (""A points"") the Council is expected to adopt Conclusions on applications of the European **Global Navigation Satellite Systems**.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101022,Response to the review of the resilience of England's transport systems in winter,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):**  On 26 July 2010 I responded to the interim findings of the independent review panel examining the resilience of England's transport systems in winter. The panel are publishing their final report today. I would like to thank David Quarmby CBE (chair) and his fellow panel members Brian Smith and Chris Green, for their further thoughtful analysis and recommendations.  Copies of the review have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

As today's report notes, much action has already been taken by local and national highway authorities, salt suppliers, government and others to help keep our road network moving in the event of snow and ice this winter.  But as the previous two winters have shown, we cannot be complacent.

Following July's interim report, I immediately instructed the Highways Agency to build up a national strategic salt supply of last resort. I am pleased to report that the Highways Agency has made arrangements for the import of 250,000 tonnes of salt which is expected to start arriving this month.  I am in full agreement with the panel's view that this should be considered as a short term reaction to current exceptional circumstances following two successive severe winters.

I therefore welcome the recommendations to improve resilience in salt supply in the longer term through: greater efficiencies in salt utilisation; increased throughput flexibility by suppliers; a new recommended standard of 12 days (48 runs) pre-season stockholding by local highway authorities; and regular monitoring of the national stock position.  I urge all parties to take forward the recommendations that relate to them.

The Department for Transport has already been monitoring the national salt stock position in the run up to winter, in order to help highway authorities and suppliers to make better informed decisions.  Working with the UK Roads Liaison Group the Department has also commissioned the production of technical guidance for local highway authorities on standards and methods to reduce the utilisation of salt without compromising effectiveness.   This guidance, which will be available from the end of this month, will help to ensure that salt is spread at appropriate and effective levels, but not overspread, thereby helping to conserve stock as well as reducing costs to local highway authorities.  Today's independent report also highlights the economic and social costs of winter disruption, which highway authorities and others will wish to consider when making their future local investment decisions.

I note the review panel's conclusion that the rail industry had learnt valuable lessons from the winter of 2008/9 and overall coped well with the severe weather in 2009/10.  I agree that the industry can improve performance further still by considering the additional measures around emergency timetables, technical improvements, and ensuring that the industry works closely with local highway authorities regarding responsibilities for de-icing key areas.

The report notes that the aviation industry generally anticipates and manages the effects of severe weather to a very high standard of resilience and is already pursuing measures, including additional resilience around the supply of de-icing materials.  I welcome the recommendation that the Civil Aviation Authority should consider improving the availability of performance information for passengers and the market.

Across all modes of travel, the report acknowledges the importance of communications in extreme weather for the travelling public.  I agree with the panel that those delivering transport services should continue to look to the opportunities that advances in technology may provide to improve communications with their customers.

Finally, in response to public concerns about the fear of litigation and following a recommendation in the Panel's interim report, the Government is today publishing brief guidance for households and traders who wish to clear snow and ice from paths in front of their property, pavements and other public spaces.  I hope that this will empower those who wish to act in a neighbourly way.

The United Kingdom was represented by the Deputy Permanent Representative.

The Council reached a Political Agreement on the Directive amending Directive 1999/62 on charging of heavy goods vehicles (the **Eurovignette Directive**). The Political Agreement was acceptable to the UK.

Neither the existing Directive nor the proposed amendment require the use of tolls or user charges but where Member States choose to apply them they must respect the rules. The Presidency had tabled a compromise proposal, the main elements of which were: to remove all requirements for mandatory hypothecation of revenues to transport projects, to remove the possibility of adding a supplement for congestion, while allowing significant variation of charges within the overall revenue limit; and to allow Member States the choice not to apply tolls and charges to lorries below 12 tonnes.

Further modifications made by the Presidency at the Council, included provision that the cleanest vehicles would be exempt from any external cost charges for four years after dates of application; and that EURO V and EURO VI standard vehicles would have a zero charge for air pollution until the end of 2013 and 2017 respectively; On the key issues for the UK (mandatory hypothecation and inclusion of vehicles under 12 tonnes) the text was acceptable.

The UK and Sweden entered a Minutes Statement, stating that in our view the Directive should have been taken on a fiscal legal base.

The Council adopted a mandate authorising the Commission to open **negotiations with Brazil** on a comprehensive air transport agreement, with the aim of opening up traffic rights between the EU and Brazil. The UK supports the opening of negotiations.

There was an exchange of views on **Strategy and the Future of Transport 2010-2020**, in advance of publication of the European Commission's White Paper on transport policy, expected in December or January.

In the debate, Member States supported the need to develop a more sustainable transport network. There was wide support for a financial framework to support infrastructure developments and intelligent transport technology (ITS) implementation, although some Member States pointed out that the EU must not undermine domestic efforts to cut deficits. The UK highlighted the need to focus on areas with proven EU added value and ensure long term fiscal stability. Major EU projects such as SESAR and Galileo should be completed on time and budget. Long term priorities should be the full liberalisation of the single market, transport safety and security, recognising trade opportunities, and moving to a low carbon economy.

Under AOB, the Commission presented a draft Council Decision on the Public Regulated Service of the **Galileo satellite navigation programme**.  This should be ready to put to the Council early next year.

The Commission also presented a proposal for a **recast of the rail liberalisation package**, on which discussions in the working group have already started.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101026,Investment in Highway and Local Transport Schemes,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):**  With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the Government's investment plans for our transport networks. During the course of my remarks, hon. Members might find it helpful to refer to the documents that I placed in the Library of the House and the Vote Office a few minutes ago.

As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor explained last week, the decisions that we have taken to cut waste, end lower-priority programmes and reform the welfare system allow us to invest in Britain's long-term economic growth and to prioritise transport infrastructure to support that growth. We have already announced a green light for Crossrail and for tube upgrades, plans for investment in low-carbon vehicles and recharging infrastructure, and work on a high-speed rail network. Work is continuing on the evaluation of additional investment in major rail projects, and I expect to be able to make an announcement to the House on that in the next few weeks.

Today, I can confirm a programme of investment in our crucial strategic road network, managed by the Highways Agency, and in our local transport networks. We will continue to invest in capital maintenance, spending £5.9 billion over the next four years on unglamorous but important works to maintain the integrity of the network, both strategic and local.

We have also allocated more than £180 million over the four-year period for high-value minor enhancements to the strategic road network. We are taking action to reduce the cost of proposed Highways Agency schemes by re-specifying, renegotiating with suppliers and improving governance and control. Thanks to those decisions, I can confirm that funds will be available for sustainable upgrades to the strategic network to tackle congestion hotspots, delivering network-wide benefits that provide very high returns on investment.

I can confirm today that the eight Highways Agency major schemes currently under way will be funded to completion and open to the public in the next two years. I can also announce today funding for 14 new projects, including the schemes announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor last week, to commence on site by April 2015. These are: the A11 Fiveways dualling; the M4 and M5 junction north of Bristol; the M6 between junctions 5 and 8 in Birmingham; the M62 between junctions 25 and 30 near Leeds; three schemes on the M1 between Derbyshire and Wakefield from junctions 28 to 31, 32 to 35A and 39 to 42; four schemes around Manchester from junctions 8 to 12 and from 12 to 15 on the M60; junctions 18 to 20 on the M62 and from Knutsford to Bowdon on the A556; improvement of the A23 between Handcross and Warninglid; the completion of the upgrading of the M25 with a managed motorway scheme for peak time hard-shoulder running between junctions 23 and 27 and between junctions 5 and 7. Those essential investments will cut congestion, improve journey times and, most importantly, support economic growth. Every pound we spend on these schemes will generate on average £6 of benefits.

I can also confirm that work will continue on developing a further set of Highways Agency schemes ready to start in the next spending review period if funds become available. A detailed list is included in the documents I referred to earlier. There is also one last group of four current Highways Agency schemes that will be reviewed to see if they still represent value for money and can be progressed for the next spending review period.

Important as strategic roads are to the national economy, many of the highest value-for-money proposals are those that address the needs of the local road and public transport infrastructure that supports the economies of our cities, towns and rural areas. That is why, last week, we announced our commitment to completing major local projects worth more than £600 million-including measures to improve access to Weymouth in time for the Olympics and acceleration of work on the Tees Valley bus network, and, I can confirm, the intention to invest up to £350 million to complete the upgrade of the Tyne and Wear metro.

We have also announced our intention to proceed with private finance initiative schemes to extend the Nottingham tram network and deliver sustained improvements in highways maintenance in Sheffield, Hounslow and the Isle of Wight. My Department will work urgently with the four local authorities concerned to ensure that we can deliver these schemes within the available funding.

My right hon. Friend the Chancellor also announced last week that we will invest more than £900 million over the next four years on new local authority major schemes: including a new bridge over the Mersey at Runcorn, partly funded by tolls; improving access to Leeds station; and extending the Midland Metro tram line from Snow Hill to New Street through Birmingham city centre.

I can confirm today that a further seven major local authority projects have also been given the green light, subject to planning and other approvals. They are: a new bus interchange and associated transport improvements in Mansfield; a new bypass, which will take traffic away from communities in Sefton; an integrated package of sustainable transport improvements in Ipswich; major improvements to the M5 at junction 29 east of Exeter, providing access to new housing and employment areas; a bypass to the north of Lancaster, improving connections between the port of Heysham and the M6; improvements on the A57 east of the M1 junction 31, near Todwick; and a new northern distributor road in Taunton to provide additional cross-town capacity and access to areas of brownfield land.

Those schemes, worth about £300 million in total, have been selected from a pool of projects with proven business cases. They are listed as supported schemes and shaded green in the list to which I referred earlier. Our duty, however, is to ensure that every pound that is spent is essential. Even with those priority schemes, I expect the local authority promoters to work with my Department to ensure that every opportunity for cost saving has been taken and every source of alternative contributions has been fully explored before funding is confirmed in January next year.

Although the House will welcome the decisions, Members on both sides of the House will want to know how we propose to handle the remaining schemes. The £600 million plus remaining for additional new projects, after the announcements already made, demonstrates the importance that we attach to local authority major schemes, but it will not be enough to fund all the schemes proposed by local authorities. In the list that I have placed in the Library, I have included all currently submitted schemes, including three that previously had conditional approval and that we will now seek to progress to full approval, showing how we propose to categorise each of them.

For 22 schemes, for which my Department has completed a value-for-money assessment in the past four years, we will invite best and final funding bids from the development pool-the schemes shaded amber in the list. Promoters will be challenged by my Department to consider the scope of the scheme, its cost, lower-cost alternatives and their ability to contribute more locally. Those who can make the best case are the most likely to receive funding, which will be confirmed by the end of 2011.

Further analysis will be carried out on another 34 schemes, for which the Department does not currently have an up-to-date assessment, to determine whether they can go forward to join the development pool and bid for a share of the £600 million plus of funds available. Those schemes are shaded blue on the list. A decision will be made by January 2011.

This competitive process will ensure that the greatest possible number of schemes, with the best value for money, will be able to proceed, facilitating economic growth and creating jobs across the country. Under regional funding allocations, regional and local bodies were encouraged by the previous Government to identify a large number of schemes for longer-term prioritisation. Many of those were in the early stages of development, with no business cases submitted to the Department for Transport before the cut-off that we announced on 10 June this year.

In the longer term, I want such decisions on local transport priorities to be taken out of Whitehall and placed in the hands of local people. My Department will work with the emerging local enterprise partnerships and local authorities to identify the best approach to local decision making on future transport priorities.

I have set out our decisions and what they mean for our strategic and local transport networks. The measures will help to deliver long-term, sustainable and affordable economic growth in this country. The difficult choices made by the Government have allowed us to invest in the future. I commend the statement to the House.

HS1 Limited is the company which holds the concession to operate Britain's first high speed railway, running from Central London to the Channel Tunnel. It also includes the stations at St. Pancras International, and the international stations at Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford. It is used by Eurostar and the Kent domestic high-speed services. Deutsche Bahn have also recently announced their intention, by 2013, to start running international services over the line to Frankfurt and Amsterdam, via Brussels.

The successful bidder is a consortium comprising of ""Borealis Infrastructure"" and ""Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan"", each with a 50% stake. The acquisition value is just under £2.1bn. The sale receipts will be paid on completion of the contract, which is expected to happen later this month. At that point, the consortium will become the owner of HS1 Limited which has a 30 year concession to manage the High Speed 1 line and stations. Under the terms of the concession, HS1 has the rights to sell access to track and stations on a commercial basis whilst having to preserve the nature and capacity of the high-speed railway and to maintain and renew it to modern standards. Compliance with these terms is overseen by the Office of Rail Regulation.

The Secretary of State for Transport will continue to own the infrastructure of the railway and the freehold to the associated land. On expiry of the concession, the Government will once more take unencumbered ownership of the railway with the opportunity to let a further concession. In addition, the Government retains a 40% stake in Eurostar International Ltd. and development rights on the major associated regeneration sites at Kings Cross and Stratford.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101125,Rail Investment,"Written statement by Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):**  This statement sets out the Government's plans for investment in rail infrastructure and rolling stock. It builds on the announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the outcome of the Spending Review.

Over the next four years, we will provide £14 billion of funding to Network Rail to support capital maintenance and infrastructure investment; and £750 million for high speed rail. We will also fund the Crossrail project, the Tube upgrade programme, light rail projects in Birmingham, Tyneside, Nottingham and Sheffield; and provide additional funding to franchisees for extra rolling stock.

Today, I can confirm we will fund and deliver the Thameslink programme in its entirety, virtually doubling the number of north-south trains running through central London at peak times. But the original programme for the rebuilding of London Bridge was always ambitious, with substantial risks around delivery, and operation of existing services, during construction.  To reduce these risks, we have re-profiled the delivery of the programme to achieve completion in 2018.  This will enable Network Rail to make further efficiencies to their design and delivery programme.

As part of the Thameslink programme, we will procure a new fleet of trains - up to 1,200 new carriages. This is in addition to around 600 new carriages which will be provided for the Crossrail project. The new Thameslink and Crossrail rolling stock will enable the redeployment of hundreds of serviceable electric carriages currently used on Thameslink services.  These carriages belong to rolling-stock leasing companies, but we expect they will be available at competitive leasing prices for re-use elsewhere, thus justifying further electrification of our network.

As a first step, Network Rail will electrify the commuter services on the Great Western Main Line from London to Didcot, Oxford and Newbury over the next six years. Electric trains will speed up journeys, improve reliability and reduce the impact on the environment. Network Rail will also electrify the lines between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool - an investment of up to £300 million. Work is expected to begin next year and to be finished in 2016. As with Thameslink, we expect Network Rail to keep a tight rein on costs.

The redeployment of electric rolling stock to these routes will, in turn, free up hundreds of diesel units which will be available to Train Operators to lease as they become available in the period after 2015.

I can also today confirm that an additional 650 carriages will have been delivered to the network between 6 May 2010 and March 2014.  This is in addition to the Thameslink and Crossrail carriages I have already mentioned.

We have funding confirmed for developments at Reading, Birmingham, London Kings Cross and Gatwick Airport. In addition, investments on the East Coast Main Line and Midland Main Line and improvements in Yorkshire, on trans pennine routes, around Manchester and in South Wales will improve line speed, reliability and capacity of services.

Beyond these investments in the commuter railway, there are far-reaching decisions to be made about intercity services. The Intercity Express Programme, launched by the previous Government, identified the Agility Trains consortium as preferred bidder to build a new fleet of intercity trains. This February, my predecessors invited Sir Andrew Foster, to provide an independent assessment of the programme. Sir Andrew recommended work on the Agility Trains proposal and a detailed study of the alternatives. Following this work, the four options Sir Andrew identified, have been narrowed down to two. I have ruled out the option of requiring passengers to interchange from electric to diesel trains, recognising the value to passengers of preserving through-journeys. I have also ruled out the option of a wholesale refurbishment of the existing diesel ""Intercity 125"" fleet, some of which dates back to the 1970s.

The remaining options are, on the one hand a revised, lower cost Agility Trains proposal, which envisages a mixed fleet: some all-electric trains, and some electric trains which are also equipped with underfloor diesel engines. And on the other, a fleet of new all-electric trains which could be coupled to new diesel locomotives where the overhead electric power lines end. Both these options would allow us to preserve through-journeys between London and parts of the rail network which are not electrified. Both of them would deliver faster journey times. For example, we expect to see a time saving of at least 15 minutes, for the journey between Cardiff and London bringing it below 2 hours.

This is a major decision which will affect intercity rail travel for decades, and we must get it right. To address outstanding issues on choice of train type and further electrification on the Great Western Main Line, additional work will be required within the Department, with Agility Trains, and with the Welsh Assembly Government on the business case for electrification into Wales. I expect to announce a final decision on IEP, and on further Great Western electrification, in the New Year.

This package I have announced today has only been possible because this government has been prepared to take the tough decisions to protect investment in Britain's future. I will make a further oral statement to the House on the issues raised in this statement later today.

And by taking the tough decisions on current spending, we are able to secure our future growth by making vital infrastructure investments.

Over the next four years we will provide £14 billion of funding to Network Rail to support capital maintenance and infrastructure investment; and £750 million for high speed rail. We will also fund the Crossrail project, the Tube upgrade programme, light rail projects in Birmingham, Tyneside, Nottingham and Sheffield; and provide additional funding to franchisees for extra rolling stock.

I can also confirm today that we will fund and deliver the Thameslink programme in its entirety, virtually doubling the number of north-south trains running through central London at peak times. This huge investment will link Sussex, Kent and Surrey, through central London, with Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire.

But the original programme for the rebuilding of London Bridge Station to increase through-running as part of this project was always ambitious, with substantial risks around delivery, and operation of existing services, during construction.  To reduce these risks, we have re-profiled the delivery of the programme to achieve completion in 2018.  This will enable Network Rail to make the further efficiencies in the design and delivery of the programme, that we require to ensure value for money.  Passengers will start to benefit from incremental improvements on Thameslink routes from the end of 2011.

As part of the Thameslink programme, we will procure a new fleet of trains - up to 1,200 new carriages. This is in addition to around 600 new carriages which will be provided for the Crossrail project.

Together with the Tube upgrades, these projects represent a step change in rail capacity in London, providing a significant boost to economic growth potential in the capital.

New Thameslink and Crossrail rolling stock will enable the redeployment of hundreds of serviceable electric carriages currently used on the Thameslink services.  These carriages belong to rolling-stock leasing companies, but we expect that they will be available at competitive leasing prices for re-use elsewhere, thus justifying further electrification of the network.

As a first step, I can announce today that Network Rail will electrify the commuter services on the Great Western Main Line from London to Didcot, Oxford and Newbury over the next six years. Electric trains will speed up journeys, improve reliability and reduce the impact on the environment on these busy routes.

The Chancellor also announced on 20 October the electrification of the lines between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool - an investment of up to £300 million. I expect work in the North West to begin next year and to be completed at around the same time as the work on the Thames Valley Commuter Lines in 2016. Some sections will be completed well ahead of this, notably Manchester to Newton-le-Willows in late 2013, allowing new electric trains to operate from Manchester to Scotland. As with Thameslink, we will require Network Rail to keep a tight rein on costs.

The redeployment of electric rolling stock to these routes will, in turn, free up hundreds of diesel units which will be available to Train Operators to lease as they become available in the period after 2015.

This will all be welcome news to passengers. The Public Accounts Committee recently found that many services are unacceptably overcrowded, and I understand the frustrations of rail travellers who have to travel on packed trains.  More investment is clearly needed. That is why I argued for additional rail investment in the Spending Review, and it is also why I have taken the difficult decision to allow regulated fares to rise by 3 per cent above inflation for the three years from 2012 - to help us to pay for these investments.

Mr Speaker, in January 2008 the previous Government published a plan to bring 1,300 additional carriages into service by March 2014. This plan was never deliverable. In total, only 206 of those 1,300 carriages had entered service by May this year.

My predecessors quoted a grand total of rail carriages, but never referred publicly to the fact that delivery of that total was subject to so many caveats and qualifications as to render it effectively meaningless.  According to their published plan Mr Speaker, the 1,300 was not final and subject to - ""value for money, affordability, ...linkages with other interventions or with other rail projects, ...infrastructure constraints, ...supply chain constraints"" and ""credibility"". It went on to say in the document that ""the final outcome could well be different"".

In other words, not so much a plan as a press release.

So let me set the record straight: I can today confirm that an additional 650 carriages will have been delivered to the network between 6 May 2010 and March 2014.

This is in addition to the Thameslink and Crossrail carriages I have already mentioned.

But it isn't just about rolling stock.  Network Rail have already started work on station improvements, with funding confirmed for developments at Reading, Birmingham, London Kings Cross and Gatwick Airport.

Investments on the East Coast Main Line and Midland Main Line and improvements in Yorkshire, on trans pennine routes, around Manchester and in South Wales will improve line speed, reliability and capacity of services.

Beyond these investments, there are far-reaching decisions to be made about intercity services.

In February 2009 the Intercity Express Programme, launched by the previous Government, identified the Agility Trains consortium as preferred bidder to build a new fleet of intercity trains.

Then, this February, my predecessor invited Sir Andrew Foster, the former head of the Audit Commission, to provide an independent assessment of the programme. Sir Andrew presented his report to me at the end of June, recommending further work on the Agility Trains proposal and a detailed study of the alternatives.

I can now tell the House that we have narrowed down the options from the four Sir Andrew identified, to two.

I have ruled out the option of requiring passengers to change from electric to diesel trains at a point in their journeys, recognising the value to passengers of preserving through-journeys. I have also ruled out the option of a wholesale refurbishment of the existing diesel ""Intercity 125"" fleet, some of which dates back to the 1970s.

The remaining options are, on the one hand a revised, lower cost proposal received from Agility Trains, which envisages a mixed fleet: some all-electric trains, and some electric trains which are also equipped with underfloor diesel electric generators. And on the other, a fleet of new all-electric trains which could be coupled to new diesel locomotives where the overhead electric power lines end.

Both these options would allow us to preserve through-journeys between London and parts of the rail network which are not electrified.

Both of them would deliver faster journey times.  For example, we expect to see time savings of at least 15 minutes for the journey between Cardiff and London, bringing it below 2 hours.

This is a major decision which will affect intercity rail travel for decades to come, and we must get it right. To address the outstanding issues on choice of train type and further electrification on the Great Western Main Line, additional work will be required within the Department, with Agility Trains, and with the Welsh Assembly Government on the business case for electrification into Wales.

When this work, and discussions with the Welsh Assembly Government and my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, have concluded, I expect to announce a final decision on IEP, and on further Great Western electrification, in the New Year.

Mr Speaker, the package I have confirmed today has only been possible because this government has been prepared to take the tough decisions to protect investment in Britain's future.

This is a commitment to our railways which will benefit Britain for generations to come and I commend this statement to the House.

The Commission and Presidency will present a report on possible measures to improve aviation security. The UK welcomes this report and will press for early, effective and coordinated action by Member States.

There will also be a debate on the draft directive on cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety. The Presidency intends to reach a conclusion on progress towards a political agreement. We hope that the conclusion confirms the accepted view that political agreement can only be achieved once the UK and Ireland have completed Parliamentary scrutiny and made their opt-in decisions.

There will be a progress report and policy debate on the legislative proposal to recast the first rail package, establishing a single European railway area, which was presented to the Council in October.

A progress report will be considered on work towards a Council and European Parliament Decision on access to the Public Regulated Service of the Galileo satellite navigation system. I will press for greater clarity on the estimated infrastructure and operational costs as well as an indication from the Commission on whether it proposes to charge Member States for access to the Public Regulated Service. This will help the Government determine its position on use of this service. The Government continues to oppose increasing the budget for completion of the Galileo system.

The Council will be asked to adopt conclusions, on the integration of waterborne transport into the EU logistics chain. These conclusions follow the Informal Meeting of EU Transport Ministers held in Antwerp in September. We welcome these conclusions on this important sector.

The Council will also be asked to adopt Conclusions following the Commission's recent Communication entitled ""Towards a European road safety area: policy orientations on road safety 2011-2020"". As the conclusions set out that any new EU legislation must be proportionate and supported by robust impact assessments, I intend to support their adoption.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20101206,Outcome of the review of the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** I wish to inform the House of the outcome of the review of the _Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010_.

On 8 July, I announced the review of the Regulations and I asked all interested parties to make representations to me by 30 September. On the same day, I also laid a Statutory Instrument - the _Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfer) (Amendment) Regulations 2010_ - before the House, in order to defer the coming into force date of the Regulations from 1 October 2010 until 1 April 2011.

During the period of the review, from 8 July to 30 September inclusive, I received 32 written representations and held three meetings with interested parties at their request.

In considering these representations, I have been left in no doubt that this is an important issue - not only for the shipping companies who benefit from these practices, but equally for local residents who have concerns about the potential impact of any accident on their coastline.  In deciding how best to proceed, it has been necessary to strike a balance between ensuring that these operations are properly regulated, while recognising the benefits of ship-to-ship transfer.

On the basis of the written representations and the points made to me in meetings conducted in the context of the review, I have drawn the following conclusions:

  * I intend to change the policy on ship-to-ship transfers outside harbour authority areas. Instead of a general prohibition, there will be a regime which will:
    * restrict ship-to-ship transfers outside harbour authority areas to a single designated area within the UK Territorial Sea;
    * establish a system of permits issued by the MCA; and
    * give effect at the same time to the new chapter 8 of Annex I to the MARPOL Convention.
  * I intend to maintain, without change, the policy of requiring oil transfer licences for harbour authorities. Harbour authorities which already have a history of hosting ship-to-ship transfers will, of course, continue to benefit from transitional arrangements.
  * I shall also take account, in reshaping the policy, of some specific instances where a type of ship or a type of activity needs to be treated in a way which departs from the general rules, or where the application of the rules needs to be adjusted to allow normal harbour activities to continue unhindered.

The Department's officials will now proceed to draft the necessary amending legislation, on the basis which I have described. I shall be taking a keen interest in the progress which they make.

I will be placing an analytical table, which summarises the points of substance made in the written representations and the meetings held with interested parties, on the Department's website and in the Libraries of the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101207,Rail Industry Review,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** This Government is determined to secure a sustainable and efficient railway. The Spending Review settlement has demonstrated our commitment to rail transport. The sustained financial support we have offered now needs to be matched by a relentless drive for efficiency on the part of the industry.

Sir Roy McNulty's value for money review has reached some important interim conclusions. In his [interim report](http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/strategyfinance/valueformoney/interim/) being published today and being made available in the Library of the House he finds that:

  * the railway is costing more than it used to and more than it ought to. Greater efficiency would realise savings of £600 million - £1,000 million per annum by 2018-19 without cutting services or lowering quality;
  * the key to securing these efficiencies is a cross-industry focus on reducing costs and improving value for money;
  * that in turn demands closer working and alignment of incentives between train operators and Network Rail and strong leadership across the industry. Inevitably, such alignment, if it is to be effective, will involve Network Rail working more closely at a local level with Train Operators.

The most pressing need is to ensure that incentives across the industry are aligned, so that all parties strive to improve the quality of services and to provide value for money for taxpayers and passengers. Train operators are too narrowly focussed on franchise specifications (which are often over-detailed). Network Rail has concentrated on network performance and safety targets. These are important objectives. But there is no cross-industry focus on the fundamental purpose of the railway - moving people and goods efficiently across a network while securing the best long-term value for money for farepayers and taxpayers.

The second phase of the value for money study will focus on identifying opportunities for greater alignment and changes that will secure greater efficiency and better value for money. Sir Roy's final report is due to be published in April 2011. These initial conclusions, however, are so important that it would be wrong to wait until then before starting to respond.

Today I am announcing the establishment of a high level group, which I will chair, that will examine the options for getting those responsible for track and train to work together to drive down the cost of the railway for the benefit of passengers and taxpayers, while improving the quality of services. Sir Roy McNulty's final report will inform the group's work.

This group will consider options for structural reform in the industry. My presumption is that, at an operational level, there are some network-wide planning and technical functions which can only be discharged by a single national body, acting as custodian of the network. That should not preclude reforms which allow route or area based alliances to be established, focussed on aligning specific track and train operations where this best serves the needs of customers.

I am clear, however, that no changes should be made which would jeopardise the impressive improvements in safety and punctuality achieved across the industry in recent years. There is a spectrum of options which could contribute to achieving a better alignment of incentives. We expect that the optimal solution will vary for different parts of the network, reflecting the diversity of our railways and differing local needs. A one-size-fits-all model is unlikely to be the right solution. I am also clear that the changes we are proposing must protect the interests of freight operators on the network.

I envisage that this work will lead to the publication of proposals for industry reform by November 2011 - as set out in my Department's [Business Plan](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dft-business-plan-2011-2015/#).

In parallel with the value for money review, my Department has been consulting on possible changes to the franchising system. We have invited views on moving to longer franchises with less detailed specifications and greater incentives for operators to act efficiently and invest in the improvements passengers want. These principles have been widely welcomed and they will form part of our plans for making the railway more efficient and more responsive to passengers' needs.

However, franchising reform needs to be coordinated with Network Rail reform: they are two sides of the same coin. We also need to co-ordinate the programme of franchise renewals to take account of major planned railway projects which will inevitably disrupt operations in certain franchises.

A number of franchises will fall due for re-tendering over the next couple of years. Because we intend, typically, to let longer franchises of at least 15 years duration it is important that the reforms we wish to make following the McNulty review, the franchise consultation and the work of the high level group are incorporated into the terms of these franchises.

I therefore propose to use a short contract, openly competed during 2011, to run and improve services in the Greater Anglia franchise whilst we carry out this work. I then expect to award a new long term franchise for the operation of services in East Anglia to commence in 2013. In 2012, I propose to award a franchise to operate Inter City West Coast until the planned opening of HS2 in 2026. Then, in late 2012, I propose to award a franchise of 15 years to operate the East Coast Main Line services.

The rest of the retendering programme for 2012 and 2013 will depend partly on decisions by my department and existing operators on the termination dates of current franchises. We also need to avoid overloading the industry by inviting too many tenders at the same time. The Trans Pennine Express franchise could contractually be extended by up to five years beyond 2012: my department is discussing a proposal for an extension with the current operator. Alternatively, this franchise could be retendered for at least 15 years, possibly in 2013 alongside the Northern franchise. The Essex Thameside franchise will also be retendered by 2013 for at least 15 years. The Greater Western franchise will be retendered in either 2013 or 2016, again for at least 15 years, upon expiry of the existing franchise agreement in accordance with its terms. In the case of Thameslink and South Eastern it is not currently appropriate to let long-term franchises, since both will be heavily affected by Thameslink work at London Bridge station. So these franchises will be retendered on a short-term interim basis as they fall due. My department will then let long-term franchises to cover the operation of Thameslink and South Eastern services, once the London Bridge Station reconstruction is complete.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20101208,Government support for the maritime industry and light dues update,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** I am today announcing a package of measures relating to the maritime industry following the Spending Review and a recent review I have undertaken of light dues.

Shipping is important to the UK both as the means by which the majority of goods are moved in and out of the country and as a significant contributor to the UK economy in its own right. The Government therefore wishes to see a strong and sustainable maritime sector for the future and to minimise the burdens the industry faces.

With this in mind, the Government has listened carefully to the views of both the shipping industry and the General Lighthouse Authorities on the need for stability in the future level of charges set by the Department for Transport for marine aids to navigation.

In my Written Ministerial Statement of 26 July 2010 [Official Report, Columns 75-76WS] on marine aids to navigation, I announced that the Government does not intend to change the basis on which light dues are currently charged.   I am now pleased to announce a commitment that there will be no increases in light dues for at least the next three years.

I am also inviting the views of the Lights Finance Committee, which includes representatives of the payers of light dues, on what an appropriate level of dues for the future would be that balances the need to reduce demands on the shipping industry with the need to maintain essential aids to navigation. I have asked the Committee to report its conclusions to me by February 2011.

Sustainable economic growth also requires investment in training and skills. I am therefore also pleased to be able to announce that, despite the difficult public spending climate, the Government will continue to provide a partial financial contribution towards the cost of training seafarers under the existing Support for Maritime Training Scheme, with the remainder of those costs being met by employers.

Within its Spending Review settlement the Department for Transport has been able to allocate some £12m to support maritime training in the next financial year.  I intend that the majority of this money should be focussed on supporting initial training for cadets studying at junior officer level (SMarT 1). I estimate that this will enable the Department to contribute to the training of up to 1,000 new cadets starting their training during the next academic year. In order to provide reassurance, I can also confirm that we will make funding available beyond next year for all cadets starting SMarT 1 training in 2011/12, and those already undergoing SMarT1 training, for the duration of their studies to Officer of the Watch Certificate.

In addition, I intend that funding should also remain available next year for ratings training and for ratings to officer conversion training and I anticipate that some funding should  be available to support the first instalment of SMarT 2 - helping those SMarT 1 officer cadets who are also working towards Foundation and other Degrees, Higher National Diplomas or Scottish Diplomas to complete their studies.

For the remaining parts of the SMarT programme, including SMarT 2 training beyond the first instalment, the Government believes that in current circumstances it is more appropriate that the cost of this additional training should be met in full by employers.

During the year I intend to commission a review of the Support for Maritime Training scheme to consider the continuing requirement for Government support for training and skills development in this sector and how best to spend any continuing Government funding. I will report back to the House on the terms of reference for the review in due course.

In current fiscal circumstances, the Government has also had to look hard at other areas of taxpayer support to shipping.

The current Crew Relief Costs Scheme (CRCS) provides limited financial assistance to shipping companies towards the cost of officers or ratings joining or leaving their ships abroad.  Shipping companies gain many benefits from the employment of British officers and ratings and, in light of this, the Government has come to the conclusion that continuing to provide commercial shipping companies with a subsidy to meet part of the costs of fares for seafarers can no longer be justified. The current CRCS will therefore cease on 8 March 2011.  However, under the Merchant Shipping Act, the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, will still be able to provide financial assistance in respect of travel and other costs in exceptional cases. I am also inviting those with an interest in CRCS to submit suggestions for how the Department may be able to provide non-monetary assistance to encourage the continued employment of UK seafarers.

The Department for Transport also currently provides a financial contribution towards the costs of the Confidential Hazardous Incident Reporting Programme for shipping (CHIRP) which provides an outlet for mariners to voice safety concerns. However, the scheme has not gained the traction hoped for in the commercial shipping and fishing sectors and there are other services established by the industry such as the Nautical Institute's Mariners' Alerting and Reporting Scheme. I have therefore concluded that the Department should cease to provide financial support for this scheme at the end of this financial year. The Department will work closely with the commercial, fishing and recreational sectors to see how confidential reporting opportunities might be provided in the future without financial assistance from Government.

Coupled with the funding Local Authorities will receive through the [Integrated Transport and Highways Maintenance Blocks](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-transport-capital-block-funding/#), which I am announcing today, this represents almost £5 billion funding for small local transport schemes over the next four years.

The establishment of the LSTF reflects the importance the Government attaches to helping build locally a strong economy and addressing at a local level the urgent challenge of climate change and the commitment made in the Coalition Agreement to promoting sustainable travel initiatives.

The guidance will invite local transport authorities in England (outside London) to apply for funding to support the cost of a range of sustainable travel measures. Packages might, for example, include measures that promote walking and cycling, encourage modal shift, manage effectively demands on the network, secure better traffic management, improve road safety and improve access and mobility for local communities. The guidance will also set out the criteria against which decisions on the allocation of funding will be taken. The criteria will include meeting the core objectives of supporting economic growth and reducing carbon. Bids will also need to demonstrate value for money, deliverability and affordability of package proposals.

We have set aside the following LSTF funding over the next 4 financial years:

We wish to support as many local transport authorities as possible through the Fund. This Fund will also support Bikeability training in each financial year and the following projects in 2011-12 only in order to maintain momentum on sustainable travel whilst local authorities prepare their proposals:

£13 million for Links to Schools, Bike Club and walking to school initiatives;

£1 million for Transport Direct cycle journey planner; and

£250,000 to take forward business to business initiatives on alternatives to travel.

Authorities will be able to bid for small packages of under £5 million and larger packages of up to £50 million over the Fund period, but will only be able to be successful with one bid. The application process is being designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible with the flexibility to deal with proposals to the Fund of different complexity and scale. Local authorities will also be given a choice as to when to apply to the Fund in recognition that they will be at different levels of readiness to submit proposals, with two rounds of bidding; one closing in April, the other at a later date.

I am writing today to local transport authorities in England (outside London) inviting them to start preparing and developing their proposals and to consider what skills and resources they will require. Bids from local transport authorities will be particularly welcome if they can demonstrate support from, and the involvement of, voluntary and community organisations, and the private sector. The ability to lever in financial contributions from external sources will also be taken into account in assessing value for money.

This includes over £3 billion over the next 4 years for local highways maintenance. With limited resources available, it is essential that highways maintenance continues to be prioritised, reflecting the economic and social importance to local communities, the need to safeguard the largest single local public asset and the liabilities for future years that can be created from short-term cuts in maintenance.

The Department is also providing over £1.3 billion for small transport improvement schemes, reflecting the contribution these schemes make to improving road safety, stimulating local economies by reducing congestion, and delivering social justice to local communities.

Funding allocations are calculated according to needs-based formulae that are developed with local authorities. The funding is not ring-fenced, and local authorities are free to spend their allocations in accordance with their priorities. All funding will be supplied as capital grant, and not as supported borrowing.  The figures provided include final allocations for 2011/12 to 2012/13, and indicative allocations for 2013/14 to 2014/15.

This announcement follows a recent consultation on local transport capital funding. A summary of responses and the Department's proposed next steps are available on the Department's website at: http://www.dft.gov.uk/localtransportfunding and have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

The Council discussed air cargo security. Following the recent discovery of explosive devices in air cargo, a high level group produced a report on Strengthening Air Cargo Security, for both Council meetings on 2 December (Transport and Justice and Home Affairs). The Presidency presented this report, which sets out ways to strengthen the security regime around air cargo coming into the EU.

The UK broadly welcomed the report and the associated action plan and provided the Council with some details of the recent air cargo incident. The Presidency concluded orally that the Council had a ""positive appreciation"" of the report, and asked the Commission and Member States to ensure a speedy implementation of the action plan. The Commission was asked to report back to the Council on progress made. A parallel discussion took place in the JHA Council.

The Presidency updated the Council on progress with negotiations on the draft directive on cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety. The proposed Directive aims to improve cross-border enforcement of certain road safety offences by facilitating exchange of data between authorities. The UK and Ireland supported a proposal to change the legal base for this proposal to Justice and Home Affairs, and emphasised that this change engaged our right to decide whether or not to opt in to the Directive. We reserved our position on the substance, pending formal consideration of our stance and consultation with Parliament during the permitted three month period. Both countries tabled minute statements to this effect.

All Member States were in favour of the change of Treaty base. The Commission has however made it clear that it does not support a JHA legal base. The Presidency concluded that there was consensus on the text of the draft Directive, but did not seek confirmation of a political agreement. They acknowledged the UK's rights under Protocol 21 to have the necessary period to consider whether or not to opt in.

The Commission presented its recent proposal to recast the 2001 first rail package, which set the initial framework for a single European rail market. The Presidency gave an account of early discussions on the proposal. The discussion in the Council concluded that the publication of national rail infrastructure development strategies was a good approach. The UK broadly supported the proposal, in particular endorsing the need for adequately resourced and properly independent regulatory bodies, in order to facilitate market entry and competition. However, I highlighted the importance of effective enforcement of the existing directive if we are to see real progress on opening up rail markets across Europe to cross-border competition. Discussions will continue under the Hungarian Presidency.

The Presidency reported on progress in discussions on a proposal for a Decision on the Public Regulated Service (PRS) of the Galileo programme. The Decision would set out controls over access to the high-accuracy positioning signal from Galileo. The UK noted the lack of an impact assessment and expressed disappointment at the lack of visibility on costs. We expressed concern about handling of security and stressed that Common Minimum Standards needed to be defined by the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Security Board. Discussions will continue under the Hungarian Presidency.

Following the Informal Meeting of EU Transport Ministers held in Antwerp in September, the Council adopted Conclusions on the integration of waterborne transport into the EU logistics chain. The Conclusions are acceptable to the UK.

The Council also adopted Conclusions following the Commission's Communication entitled ""Towards a European road safety area: policy orientations on road safety 2011-2020"". The Conclusions state that any new EU legislation must be proportionate and supported by robust impact assessments, and the UK was able to support their adoption.

Among AOB items, the Commission gave a presentation of its recent proposal to revise the Regulation which established the European Maritime Safety Agency and to bring the Agency's tasks into line with more recent legislation. The UK supported a statement by Germany, which expressed concern about any increase in EMSA's budget and staffing.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20101214,Crossrail project update,"Written statement by the The Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** I wish to update the House on Crossrail progress since my annual update on 15 July 2010 [Official Report, Columns 43-44WS], in which I undertook to report later in the year on progress made by Crossrail Limited on their value for money programme.

The Spending Review announcement confirmed Government's joint commitment with the Mayor of London to delivering Crossrail, and secured the funding to deliver the scheme to its original scope.

As I indicated in July, Crossrail Limited has been undertaking a programme of value engineering, risk avoidance and mitigation, alongside indirect cost reduction to ensure that the scheme is delivered in the most efficient way possible. In line with this approach, the Government accepted an engineering-led solution to delivering the central section which has enabled substantial savings of around £1billion to the Crossrail funding package to be identified. While the construction programme for the central section will be lengthened by around a year, this has enabled the Government to confirm that funding is available for the whole project.

We now expect that Crossrail services will commence from 2018. However, the detailed timetable for the phased introduction of Crossrail services requires additional work in a number of areas. For example, further work needs to take place on:

(i) the transfer of services from existing franchises to the future Crossrail operations; and

(ii) the development of detailed plans on the commissioning of services.

It should be noted that Crossrail services were always planned to be phased into operation over some months and it remains a priority for the Government to ensure services are commissioned in the most efficient possible way.

In addition, I wish to inform the House that Crossrail Limited has issued its notice of intention to award the tunnelling contracts for the central section tunnels. These contracts mark a further milestone in Crossrail's progress towards the start of tunnelling in late 2011.

Crossrail Limited continues to work to achieve further savings in advance of the final review point for the project in Spring next year. I expect to make a further update on progress then.

However, the preferred bidder has informed the Ministry of Defence within the last 48 hours that it has become aware of a possible issue in connection with its bid to provide the UK Search and Rescue capability, which was the basis of its selection as the preferred bidder as announced in February 2010.

In the circumstances it is not appropriate for us to proceed with the planned announcement until the status of this issue has been clarified.

My Rt Hon Friend and I will make a further statement to the House as soon as we are able to provide further information and to set out our plans for proceeding to secure the provision of Search and Rescue helicopter capability in the future.   We regret the further uncertainty that this entails for all those involved in providing the UK's Search and Rescue service.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20101216,Modernisation of coastguard services,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The United Kingdom is fortunate to have strong and effective front-line Search and Rescue capabilities, many of which are provided by volunteers, including some 3,500 volunteer Coastguards carrying out coastal rescues, the lifeboats operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the volunteer Mountain Rescue Teams. I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and commitment of these volunteers who provide a long-standing example of the contribution that individuals can make to the society in which they live.

Our front-line Search and Rescue services could not, however, function effectively and save the lives that they do without effective arrangements to identify and manage incidents, including directing the best placed and most suitable rescue assets to the scene. These arrangements are provided through our regular Coastguard officers who also monitor ship movements around our coasts, provide information and services to seafarers and recreational water users, operate Vessel Traffic Monitoring Schemes in some locations, including the English Channel, contribute to counter-pollution activities in our waters and support our volunteer Coastguard force. They are currently located in 18 Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres around the UK.

The Coastguard has a long and distinguished history.  But in common with all public services it cannot stand still. Our seas are becoming busier with larger ships and increasing numbers of offshore renewable energy platforms, making key areas of our seas more congested. There are also increasing numbers of people using our beaches, coastlines and seas for leisure activities.

The current organisation of the Coastguard - which dates back some forty years - is not well placed to respond to these challenges.  The lack of national coordination between the centres can result in limited resilience and an uneven distribution of the workload, especially during busy periods.

The latest technologies offer opportunities to address these issues and to modernise the Coastguard enabling it to deliver a more integrated and improved level of service, at lower cost, with better-rewarded staff taking on increased responsibilities and with enhanced career opportunities.

With these objectives in mind, I am today launching a 14 week consultation about the modernisation of the Coastguard Service. The consultation document, which is available in the Libraries of the House and on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency website [www.mcga.gov.uk](http://www.mcga.gov.uk/), sets out proposals to:

  * Establish two nationally networked Maritime Operations Centres, located at Aberdeen and the Southampton/Portsmouth area, capable of managing maritime incidents wherever and whenever they occur and with improved information systems, together with a 24 hour centre at Dover looking over the busy Channel Traffic Separation Scheme.
  * Provide for five other sub-centres, fully integrated into the national network around the coast and operating during daylight hours. On the basis of an evaluation of the existing sites and the facilities available at them, it is proposed three of these should be located at Falmouth, Humber and Swansea.  We also require sub-centres at either Belfast or Liverpool and either Stornoway or Shetland. The case for selection between these locations is more marginal. We are therefore inviting comments and information about factors that should influence the choice of sites for these two sub-centres.
  * Provide high quality and demanding jobs for our Coastguards, with the job weight and pay reflecting the increased demands placed upon them in line with Civil Service pay guidelines.
  * Strengthen the leadership and support provided to our volunteer Coastguards in the Coastguard Rescue Service.
  * Improve present levels of service to the public while reducing costs.

The proposals do not affect the small centre operated by the Coastguard alongside the Port of London Authority on the Thames in London.

These changes will strengthen the Coastguard service by dealing with potential points of weakness in current structures and adding resilience throughout the system while also maintaining strong regional links and enhancing front-line rescue services through the volunteer Coastguard.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101220,High Speed Rail,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the Government's plans for the development of a national high speed rail network, and on the proposed route that we will put forward next year for public consultation.

One of the Coalition's main objectives is to build an economy which is more balanced both sectorally and geographically, that will deliver sustainable economic growth while delivering on our climate change targets. Investment in infrastructure, and transport infrastructure in particular, will be a key part of that approach.

To deliver economic growth and carbon reduction we must provide attractive alternatives to short-haul aviation, while addressing the issue of scarce rail capacity between the city centres. Network Rail has calculated that by 2024 the West Coast Main Line will effectively be full, with no further enhancements that could reasonably be made to meet future demand.

The Government believes that the best long-term solution to these challenges is the development of a national high-speed rail network. Our proposed strategy is for a Y-shaped network, to be delivered in two phases: the first a line from London to the West Midlands, and the second the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds with connections to points further north via the East and West coast mainlines.

Our proposals would provide an unprecedented increase in capacity on the key north-south routes out of London, through a combination of new infrastructure and released capacity on existing lines.

Reliability would be improved and journey times between major cities would be slashed. Central Birmingham would be brought within 49 minutes of London - potentially less for non-stopping trains - and within 1 hour 5 minutes of Leeds. The released capacity on the West Coast Mainline would offer the possibility of commuter frequency fast services to London from places like Coventry and Milton Keynes.

By running trains seamlessly onto existing inter-city routes, our proposed network would also bring Glasgow and Edinburgh to within three-and-a-half hours of London - fast enough to induce a major shift of passengers from domestic aviation. In the longer-term, we will also explore with the Scottish Government the options for further reducing journey times to Scotland.

The development of a high speed rail network has been a key factor in our decision on additional runways at London's airports, and that is why we have said from the outset that any such network must be linked to our principal gateway airport and integrated with the European high speed network via HS1. In June, I asked HS2 Ltd to carry out additional work on such links. I have studied that work and the recommendations of Lord Mawhinney's review.  I have also examined Arup's proposals for a transport hub near Iver.

I have concluded that a spur to the airport, running on the surface close to the M25 for part of its length, is the best option. It is lower-cost than the other options considered by HS2 Ltd, keeps journey times between London and Birmingham to a minimum, and retains the flexibility to be extended into a loop in future. In order to deliver the best possible value for taxpayers' money, I propose that a spur be constructed as part of the second phase of the network, opening at the same time as the routes to Manchester and Leeds.  I have today asked HS2 Ltd, to carry out further work on such a spur route, with a view to public consultation later in this Parliament alongside the routes to Manchester and Leeds.

For the period prior to the opening of that second phase, high speed rail travellers to the airport would be able to change to fast Heathrow Express services at Old Oak Common, where there would also be a direct interchange with Crossrail.

With regard to a link to HS1, HS2 Ltd's report identifies that a connection can be made via a new tunnel from Old Oak Common to the North London Line near Chalk Farm, from where existing infrastructure can be used to reach the HS1 line north of St Pancras. This proposal is significantly cheaper than any other option for a direct link, and would enable direct trains to run from the midlands and the north to Europe, without affecting existing service levels on the North London Line.

Such a tunnel can only be constructed before the Old Oak Common interchange comes into operation, so this link will be included in the phase one scheme put forward for consultation.

Mr Speaker, the Government believes that the construction of a high speed rail network will support economic growth and the rebalancing of the UK economy. But we recognise that the proposed line will have significant local impacts on the areas it passes through. And that we have a duty to do everything practically possible to mitigate those impacts.

That is why, since my appointment as Secretary of State, I have reviewed the proposals of the previous administration. I have looked at the case for High Speed Rail, at the corridor options for a north-south route, at the different route options put forward by HS2 Ltd and in detail at the route option recommended in its March report. I have reached the conclusion, as the previous administration did, that the route option recommended in March represents the most appropriate general alignment for the High Speed Railway between London and the West Midlands. However before finalising the detailed route that I am publishing today for consultation, I travelled the length of it and talked directly to local authorities, property owners, many of the protest groups and their Members of Parliament, as well as commissioning additional work on the options for improving the proposed alignment.

As a consequence, significant amendments have been made to both the vertical and horizontal alignment, and to the proposed mitigation measures. In total, around 50% of the preferred route proposal published in March has been amended in some respect.

I am confident that solutions have now been found which can significantly mitigate the impacts of the railway at local level which, when properly understood, will reassure many of those who have been understandably apprehensive about the potential impact on their lives and their property values.
For instance, in Primrose Hill, work to identify the most appropriate locations for the necessary vent shafts has shifted the proposed tunnel, and thus also the vent shafts themselves, to the north, away from the most sensitive areas of this part of London, locating them alongside the existing railway.

Between Amersham and Wendover, opportunities to cover section of the proposed cutting to create a 'green bridge' and longer 'green tunnel' have been incorporated into the route design to reduce its visual impact and avoid severance of public rights of way.

At Hartwell House, by moving the alignment away from this historic property, HS2 Ltd have been able to ensure that the line would not be visible from the House itself and that additional earthworks and planting can be undertaken to further reduce visual and noise impacts.

And in the most northerly section of the route, an improved alignment has been identified which would move the line further from Lichfield.

But, Mr Speaker, despite our best efforts at mitigation, we will not be able to avoid all impacts on property values. Where a project which is in the national interest imposes significant financial loss on individuals, I believe it is right and proper that they should be compensated fairly for that loss. So I have asked my officials to prepare a range of options for a scheme to assist those whose properties would not be required for the construction of the railway, but who would nonetheless see a significant diminution of value as a result of the construction of the line. The forthcoming consultation will include proposals for such a scheme, which will sit alongside the statutory blight regime which covers those whose properties would need to be taken to build the line.

I am publishing today on my Department's website and placing in the library of the House, a set of reports by HS2 Ltd which set out for each route section the options considered and the changes proposed, together with detailed maps showing the revised preferred route from London to the West Midlands in full.  This route will form the basis for the public consultation, which I expect to begin in February next year.

When the consultation is launched, I will also publish a revised business case; a full Appraisal of sustainability; noise contour maps; and route visualisations; all of which can only be completed now that the final preferred route for consultation has been determined.

Let me be clear, the consultation will encompass the Government's strategy for a national high speed rail network, the choice of corridor and the detailed line of route that I have outlined for the initial London to West Midlands phase.

As part of the consultation process, roadshows will be held along the length of the preferred route from London to the West Midlands to ensure that local people have the opportunity to find out more about the project and to discuss specific concerns with those involved in developing the scheme.

Mr Speaker, it is my view that a high speed rail network would deliver a transformational change to the way Britain works and competes in the 21st century,

It would allow the economies of the Midlands and the North to benefit much more directly from the economic engine of London, tackling the North-South divide more effectively than half a century of regional policy has done, expanding labour markets and bringing our major conurbations closer together.

The consultation exercise we will launch in the New Year will be one of the biggest and most wide-ranging ever undertaken by Government and I urge all Hon. Members with an interest to participate and to encourage their constituents to do so.

These proposals have the support of political and business leaders from all parts of the United Kingdom, and I hope they will gain cross-party support in this House.

Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101220a,Severe winter weather,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** Mr Speaker, with your permission I would like to make a statement on the continuing severe winter weather. We are facing exceptional conditions.  It looks set to be the coldest December since 1910 with average temperatures 4-5 degrees below the norm for December. Many areas have had record low temperatures and snowfall has been the most widespread since 1981. The forecast is for continued severe cold and further snowfall through the coming week and over Christmas and the New Year.

Transport services have suffered extensive disruption in the last few days, and there is a likelihood of further disruption through this week. I recognise that this is particularly stressful just a few days ahead of the Christmas break, and I understand the frustration of those who are trying to get away or, indeed are trying to get home.

Transport services were also disrupted in the first spell of winter weather that came unusually early, at the end of November. That period tested the systems which, in some case, had performed so poorly earlier this year.

The then Government asked David Quarmby, Chairman of the RAC Foundation and a former Chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, to conduct a review of winter resilience. His initial report was issued in July and a final report was published in October. It made 28 recommendations - some of them directed at Central Government, some of them at Local Government, and some at transport operators. Many of those recommendations have already been implemented, although some will necessarily take longer.

On December 2nd, I asked David Quarmby, in the light of the weather conditions we were then experiencing, to conduct an audit of the implementation of his recommendations and to make any further observations he felt necessary. This is an independent report and I understand that David Quarmby intends to publish it tomorrow.

One of the principal recommendations of the first Quarmby report concerned salt: levels of stocks that local authorities should hold, dosage rates for optimum use of stocks and the acquisition of a strategic stockpile by Central Government. Local authorities went into this period with significantly better salt stocks than last winter and the Highways Agency, on the Government's behalf, had purchased 300,000 tonnes of salt to form a strategic stockpile, of which over 150,000 tonnes is already at UK ports with the remainder scheduled for delivery through December and early January.

Over the last few days, Highway authorities across England have been focused on delivering their planned salting and snow clearance to keep their local strategic road networks open. Together they had ready some 1.25 million tonnes of salt at the start of the winter.  As Hon members would expect, salt usage has been significantly above the norm for the time of year and so my Department decided two weeks ago to procure, as a precautionary measure, up to an additional 250,000 tonnes of salt, to replenish the strategic stockpile as salt is released to local authorities. Last Friday DfT offered 30,000 tonnes from the strategic stockpile to Local Authorities to provide reassurance over the holiday period. That allocation has been taken up and will be delivered over the next few days.

The strategic road network inevitably suffered severe disruption in the wake of heavy snowfall this weekend, but recovered reasonably rapidly and, with isolated exceptions, has operated effectively since Saturday afternoon.

Similarly, heavy snow and the formation of ice at very low temperatures has caused some disruption on rail networks on Friday and Saturday. But the rail industry has pulled together to keep essential services running, using special timetables where necessary, and I am pleased to report that commuter services into main conurbations this morning are close to normal. Transport for London have successfully followed their winter weather plans and have been able to run a near normal service across their network. However, issues with Eurostar are ongoing and have been well reported today including the impacts of very severe weather conditions in France.

Disruption due to weather conditions of this extremity is inevitable. The measure of resilience is the speed of recovery of the networks from such events. On this measure, the strategic road network and the rail network have performed broadly satisfactorily, having regard to the exceptional circumstances. The experience at airports, and Heathrow in particular, has however been different. Conditions have been difficult across North West Europe, with Frankfurt, Charles de Gaulle and Schiphol all struggling to cope at times.  This afternoon it is being reported that Brussels airport will close until Wednesday because of a lack of de-icer. But yesterday's whole day virtual closure at Heathrow, coupled with continued substantially reduced capacity, presents a very real challenge, from which the system will struggle to recover quickly.

I have spoken this morning to BAA and BA, its principle user. I am clear that BA made the right call on Saturday to cancel its flights in anticipation of the closure of the airport. Had it not done so, the scenes we witnessed on our TV screens  in the terminals on Saturday night could have been much worse.

Heathrow operates, at normal times, at some 98% of full capacity. So when there is disruption caused by snow, or the need repeatedly to close runways or taxiways for de-icing, capacity is inevitably lost and a backlog builds up.

There is still a large amount of work to be done to restore Heathrow to full capacity and further snow and severe icing is anticipated over the next few days.

The immediate focus at Heathrow must be on maximising the number of flights with the available infrastructure and, in order to do this, I have agreed with BAA this morning a relaxation of restrictions on night flights for the next four days. Operating hours will be extended until 1am and arrivals for repatriation flights will be allowed through the night. Nonetheless, BAA advises that, with further severe weather forecast, Heathrow is likely to be operating at reduced capacity until Christmas.

Conditions in the terminals overnight on Saturday were very difficult, with some 2,000 passengers stranded. Once the airport has returned to normal operation, my officials will work with BAA to understand how this situation arose, and what they plan to change to ensure we do not experience a repeat. It is clear from my discussions this morning that some preliminary conclusions have already been drawn.

We recognise that the cost, both economic and social, of this level of disruption, can be very great. Winters such as this year's and last have been rare in modern Britain, but we need to consider whether we are now seeing a step change in our weather that might justify investment in equipment and technologies to reduce the impacts of severe temperature and heavy snowfall. I will be assessing advice on this subject from the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Sir John Beddington, and  we will work with transport operators to examine the business case in each sector for increased investment in winter resilience where that makes sense - recognising always that spending more on winter preparedness inevitably means there will be less to spend on other priorities.

This is not just about making sure that people can travel and goods get delivered. Disrupted transport links, combined with cold weather, increasingly impact on other essential services. In particular, they threaten the most vulnerable in our communities.

To help those most in need to stay warm in the coldest parts of the country, the Government has, so far this winter, paid out some £355m in Cold Weather Payments, through an estimated 14.2 million payments to affected households. In addition, Winter Fuel Payments for pensioners have been protected at the higher rate for this winter with 12.9 million payments made to those older people who meet the qualifying conditions.

We have also taken precautionary steps to ensure that the Health services are well prepared, with local plans in place to deal with extra demands that this type of weather brings.

Despite these steps, weather of this severity can cause unexpected problems for many people, including those who would not normally see themselves as vulnerable but who might be in serious difficulty if their boiler breaks down or they can't get to the chemist to collect their medication. The Local Government Association will therefore be working closely with local authorities in England, with support from the Government, to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place across the country. Individual local authorities will be publicising information locally on how to access these advice services ahead of the Christmas holiday period.

Severe weather poses significant challenges to the energy supply industry. Difficult driving conditions have affected fuel oil and coal suppliers' ability to make deliveries, particularly to more remote areas away from the strategic road network. This has resulted in delivery backlogs which suppliers have been working hard, in difficult circumstances, to reduce.

Distributors are doing all they can to prioritise deliveries to vulnerable customers and those running short of fuel. Working with the Government, the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers has issued a Code of Practice to its members to help them prioritise orders to those most in need and to alert Local Authorities when they are aware of a risk that potentially vulnerable households will run short of heating oil.

The severe weather has also led to a very high forecast of demand for gas, expected to be more than 26% above the normal for this time of year. As a result the National Grid yesterday issued a Gas Balancing Alert, to provide a signal to the market to bring on additional supplies and reducing demand from large users on interruptible contracts. There is no reason to expect any disruption to domestic customers, or to commercial customers unless they have interruptible contracts in place.

My Right Honourable Friend, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has today issued a Written Statement providing more information on this issue.

Nationally, we will continue to do whatever is necessary to support essential services, and to provide advice to businesses and householders on steps they can take to help themselves and others. So, for example, we have published a 'Snow Code' to give common-sense advice to householders and businesses to help them safely clear snow and ice from pavements and public spaces, without fear of legal action. And as an emergency measure, we have relaxed the enforcement of EU drivers' hours and working-time rules to mitigate the effect of the severe weather on critical parts of the supply chain that have been badly hit by the weather.   We published guidance for local highway authorities on the range of actions that can be taken to ensure optimum use of salt stocks, and over the next few days we will publish updated technical advice based on the latest research findings so that all authorities can adopt best practice. We have also confirmed to farmers that they can use red diesel in tractors and other equipment to help salt and clear snow from public roads during extreme weather.

We are not yet through this period of severe weather. My priority at the moment remains working with the transport industries to return to normal as fast as the continued freezing temperatures this week permit, and with ministerial colleagues and officials from other Departments, with whom I have been in contact with on a daily basis since Friday to continue to monitor the situation, assess the risk of further disruption, and take whatever action is needed. These arrangements will continue in place for as long as necessary through the holiday period. I can assure the House that wherever Government action can help to ease the impact of severe weather, or mitigate its effects, we will not hesitate to take such action.

Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House.

Last week I met the working group established to conduct the review and we agreed a set of high level findings and next steps. This group included members of the motorcycle industry, trainers, riders' representatives, road safety and local authority bodies as well as DSA and DfT officials. I will be placing the report on the Departments website www.dft.gov.uk and in the Libraries of the House.

While there is more work to be done on the detail, the review has helpfully identified a set of changes to the test which have the potential to deliver my objectives for a new motorcycle test.  My goal is to see the practical test delivered as a single on-road event in a way which will maintain riding standards, protect safety and increase accessibility of the test to all candidates. The work delivered by the group includes a new hazard avoidance manoeuvre which - subject to further trialling - can be carried out on the road, as well as ways to perform the other specified manoeuvres on the road. The working group has also suggested that the slow manoeuvres (manual handling, slalom, figure of eight, U turn and slow ride) might better be examined at training centres, ahead of the main test, by delegated examiners employed by the training industry. It could be followed by a single event on road test conducted by DSA, including the remaining manoeuvres and the other elements of the road based test. This approach needs further development with the training industry.

The next step for the review will be to hold wider trials, with test-level candidates, to verify the standards, suitability and safety of the new manoeuvres, including a number of on road sites, to establish the criteria for safe on road testing. This will be followed by public consultation on the proposed changes. We will aim to implement a new test by the end of 2011 or early 2012, including on road testing initially in priority areas which are poorly served by the current network of off road test centres. Any changes to the manoeuvres would be implemented for all tests at all locations. Subject to further work on safety, cost and value for money, there would be a phased introduction of on-road testing moving to general adoption as soon as possible. Changes to the test will need to be monitored and kept under review to ensure that the review objectives are delivered in practice.

I am grateful to the members of this group for their work and note that many of them have given up their own time to contribute to the review.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20101221,Winter resilience review,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** As I explained to the House yesterday, in light of the early and severe onset of winter last month I asked David Quarmby CBE to follow up his earlier review of winter resilience with an urgent audit of how well highway authorities and transport operators in England have coped with the cold weather between 24 November and 9 December 2010.  David's report to me is published today ([transportwinterresilience.independent.gov.uk](http://transportwinterresilience.independent.gov.uk/)) and copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

In the main, he has found that the country's transport systems coped well with the early severe weather during that period.  However, given the more recent extreme cold snap, and that forecasts predict snow into the New Year, we welcome David's recommendations on how we can further bolster our resilience.  It is now vitally important that those to who they are addressed take these recommendations forward without delay.

The audit emphasises the volatile nature of British weather, but notes the Met Office's view that the three severe winters are genuinely independent events.  However, as I explained to the House yesterday, I will be assessing advice from the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Sir John Beddington, on the longer-term implications of the changing climate and the way in which they should influence our investment decisions across the sector in relation to winter resilience.

The report finds that local highway authorities generally coped well with the extreme and early winter conditions, but used a significant amount of their salt stocks in doing so.  To assist with salt supply over the Christmas and New Year holiday period when deliveries from the mines tend to become more infrequent, I am making available to highways authorities 30,000 tonnes from the national strategic salt supply which was established earlier in the year in response to Quarmby's first review.  I have also asked the Highways Agency to make arrangements for the import of further supplies of salt, up to an additional 250,000 tonnes, to strengthen further our resilience.  This is expected to start arriving in January.

But we need to ensure that we make the best possible use of existing stocks, new mine production and imported supplies.  As we cannot be sure how long the current severe weather will persist, or how often it will recur this winter, prudence requires that all highway authorities should critically examine their current levels of usage and look for economies to maximise the duration of existing stocks.

Varying spread rates between local highway authorities has been identified as a concern for David Quarmby.  I have already asked the UK Roads Liaison Group and the National Winter Service Research Group to prepare additional straightforward guidance on spread rates based on all evidence available, so that all highway authorities can adopt the practice of the best.

The report also refers to the extraordinary events that occurred on the M25 at junction 3 on 30 November.  Highways Agency officials have already briefed me on these events, and I look forward to a full report in due course analysing the incident and setting out the lessons that the Agency have learnt.

The rail network has been particularly badly affected by the weather this year, perhaps in contrast to the two previous winters.  Quarmby's recommendations here are for the longer term; and I am asking the rail industry to formulate proposals on contingency timetables, real-time information and third rail alternatives.  I will also ask them to conduct the recommended review of their operational performance.

Although the focus today is very much on aviation and the problems at Heathrow in particular, this was less of an issue during the period that this report covers and there are therefore no specific recommendations directed at the aviation sector.  It is clear, however, that, as a separate piece of work, we will need to work with BAA and the airlines to understand exactly what went wrong at Heathrow over the weekend and why it has taken the airport so long to recover.

I would like to thank David Quarmby, who has delivered this audit report to a very challenging timetable.  As with his previous reports, his analysis and recommendations are clear-sighted, and will help the transport sector to improve its resilience to winter weather.

Note:

1 - Following realignment from seasonal to calendar quarters, data for December is assumed to follow the same pattern as that of October and November.

2 - Includes railway trains but excludes underground train and light railway or tram.

3 - Includes car, van, minibus and works van.

4 - Includes bus, coach and private bus.

An investigation has shown that the error was due to a change in the Labour Force Survey methodology introduced by ONS in early 2006. Specifically, the survey changed from providing data for non-standard 'seasonal' quarters (i.e. 'Autumn' = Sep-Nov, 'Winter' = Dec-Feb, etc.) to using more standard calendar quarters from this point. As a result of this change, the Department's estimates for the period October to December in 2005 are actually based on only two months of data (Oct-Nov) instead of three months in all later years. The 2005 estimates given in the answer should therefore have been adjusted upwards by a factor of 1.5 to take account of this difference. However, this adjustment was not applied and the error was not spotted before the draft answer was submitted.

Part 3 of the Equality Act 2010 deals with discrimination, victimisation and harassment in the provision of services and the exercise of public functions. Bringing clarity and uniformity to anti-discrimination legislation as it applies to transporting people by ship or hovercraft and a service provided on such vessels is necessary as the scope and the territorial application of such legislation is far from clear. People receiving services onboard ships and hovercraft should, as far as it is reasonable to do so, have the same protection as they would on land.

Nevertheless, discrimination onboard ships and hovercraft is not reported as being a significant problem. So the intended policy approach is to maintain, as far as it is reasonable to do so, the protection which already exists against both direct and indirect discrimination, harassment and victimisation but to make the scope and extent of the legislation much simpler and clearer. Anti-discrimination legislation, in respect of the protected characteristic of disability, will however be strengthened in relation to ships and hovercraft when the EU Regulation on the rights of passengers travelling by sea and inland waterway comes into force in the UK.

This consultation will assist Government in determining how Part 3 is to apply to ships and hovercraft in relation to the actual service of transporting people and the provision of services onboard such vessels as well as those matters relating to performance of a public function in so far as it relates to disability discrimination.

The Government seek interested parties' views on the proposals. The consultation document and the impact assessment are available on the Department for Transport's website. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

The DSA is a trading fund which is funded by the fees received from customers, which are set at a level to recover its costs. The DSA therefore has a duty to ensure its costs are kept at the minimum possible level in the interests of its customers, while maintaining standards of service.  That means being as efficient as possible in every area of work and considering closely any areas of spending which may not be necessary

Following a review of its operations the DSA has decided to close its area office at Caradog House in Cardiff.

The office has 87 staff who provide administrative support for DSA within Wales, the South of England and London areas - mainly in deployment of examiners, customer service and test centre property management and procurement activities.

Staff have been informed of the decision.  There will now be a period of consultation with trade unions.  The consultation will be completed by 19 April 2011.

Possible redeployment options for the staff concerned are being explored. It is intended to retain a small office to support some operational staff in the area. Other responsibilities will be transferred to DSA's headquarters in Nottingham and northern area office in Newcastle.

Closure of Caradog House will not affect testing provision in Wales and the DSA will continue to provide services under its agreed Welsh Language Scheme.

I am pleased to inform the House that the Irish Transport Minister and I have now reached an understanding on the reform of the funding of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.

The Commissioners of Irish Lights is the general lighthouse authority which has provided marine aids to navigation for the benefit of mariners visiting and passing the shores of the whole island of Ireland for hundreds of years. The organisation has come to symbolise the close friendship and shared history of our nations.

For many years, the funding of the Commissioners of Irish Lights work has been a joint undertaking, its costs being met primarily from light dues income from commercial shipping raised in both our jurisdictions and paid into the General Lighthouse Fund.

This funding mechanism has been the subject of debate for a number of years and there have been calls to facilitate a more equitable arrangement, whereby the costs of the work of the Commissioners in the Republic of Ireland is funded solely from sources of income there.

The Irish Transport Minister and I have reached an understanding that we will aim to see the Commissioners of Irish Lights self-financing by 2015-16. This understanding will facilitate the long-term sustainable funding of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and ensure the continued co-operation of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland in the provision of marine aids to navigation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110119,"Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon - making sustainable local transport happen","Oral statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to make a statement to accompany the publication today of the Coalition Government's White Paper on Local Transport, and the simultaneous publication of bidding guidance to accompany our new 'Local Sustainable Transport Fund'.  Both documents are available to colleagues in the vote office and have been placed in the library of the house.

This Government's vision is for a transport system that helps create growth in the economy, and tackles climate change by cutting our carbon emissions.

The launch of this White Paper, and the associated Local Sustainable Transport Fund, represents a significant step towards meeting these two key government objectives.

In both the Budget and the Spending Review, the Chancellor pledged to make the tough choices that will allow us to maintain investment in new and existing infrastructure to support a growing economy, while eliminating the structural deficit over the lifetime of the Parliament.

The Spending Review reflected transport's vital role in this: I am pleased that we were able to secure significant investment to allow us to go ahead with important transport initiatives. The investment we have committed to in rail, low carbon vehicles and public and sustainable transport reflects the determination to secure growth while cutting carbon.

In the medium term, our transport decarbonisation strategy centres around the progressive electrification of the passenger car fleet, supported by policies to increase generation capacity and decarbonise the grid. By also prioritising spending on key rail projects such as high speed rail and rail electrification, we will be providing travellers with attractive new options instead of the plane and car.

In the immediate term, addressing shorter, local trips offers huge potential in helping to grow the economy and tackle climate change. Shorter trips are important - two-thirds of all journeys are under five miles. Walking, cycling and public transport are all real, greener alternatives for such trips.

What's more, we know that people who travel to the shops on foot, by bicycle or by public transport can spend more per head than those who travel by car - and research shows that improvements to the public realm can increase turnover in the high street by 5 to 15%. Increased sustainable travel also helps tackle congestion, which is a drag on business causing excess delays in urban areas at a cost of around £11 billion per annum.

And let us not forget the further benefits that follow a shift to more sustainable transport - benefits to the air we breathe, to our levels of fitness, and the money in our pockets as well.  Investment in sustainable transport helps make our towns and cities healthier and more attractive places to live, work and shop.

This White Paper sets out how we can encourage the uptake of more sustainable modes at local level, and the unprecedented £560 million we have allocated in our new 'Local Sustainable Transport Fund' will support this. Our commitment to helping local authorities with this vital agenda is reaffirmed by the amount of money we are making available.

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund forms part of a wider picture of more streamlined and simplified funding to local authorities. This will give local authorities more power and flexibility to meet local transport needs.

Across Government we have demonstrated our commitment to ending the top-down decision making, and the tendency in Whitehall to develop one-size-fits-all solutions which ignore the specific needs and behaviour patterns of local communities.

The Government has already taken significant steps to hand back power to local communities. These include replacing Regional Development Agencies with Local Enterprise Partnerships, giving communities a much greater say over planning decisions and ending the top-down imposition of housing targets.

Today's White Paper is about extending the decentralisation of power to local transport, putting into context what this means for local authorities.

We are particularly keen to receive bids for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from local authorities who are in partnership with the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector, and have the support of local businesses. We believe that by encouraging bids in this way, we will be able to capture innovative solutions to local transport needs in all areas, rural and urban.

An example I often quote is the Cuckmere Community Bus in my own constituency. Individual residents in the Cuckmere Valley have come together to run regular and frequent bus services, taking people in rural areas to their nearest towns.  These services are provided entirely by volunteers.

'Wheels to Work' schemes provide transport to people who are unable to access training, employment or education, due to a lack of suitable public or private transport.  Schemes can, therefore, particularly benefit people living in isolated rural communities and can play an important part in helping people to come off benefits and regain their independence.

These are real examples, happening right now, and we want to enable similar stories to unfold in other areas across the country.
In addition, we also recognise that there are some initiatives that benefit from a single national approach.

These include:

  * providing £11m funding for Bikeability cycle training next year, to allow 275,000 ten to eleven-year-olds to benefit from 'on-road' cycle training.  And a commitment to support Bikeability for the duration of this parliament, which will allow as many children as possible to undertake high quality cycle training;
  * improving end-to-end journeys by encouraging transport operators, and those involved in promoting cycling and car clubs or sharing, to work together, to provide better information and integrate tickets and timetables;
  * delivering, with operators and public sector bodies, the infrastructure to enable most local public transport journeys to be undertaken using smart ticketing by December 2014. We will work with the transport industry to support the development of e-purses and other technology related to smart ticketing and support the infrastructure to make this happen;
  * reviewing the way in which transport investment decisions are made to ensure that the carbon implications are fully recognised;
  * transferring responsibility for local roads classification to local authorities, giving them the flexibility to determine the status of their roads;
  * setting out in a strategic framework for road safety, by spring 2011, how to ensure that Britain's roads are among the world's safest;
  * modernising traffic signs policy so as to provide more flexibility and reduced costs and bureaucracy for local authorities to enable them to develop innovative traffic management solutions.

Mr Speaker, we want to build a transport system that is an engine for economic growth but one that is also greener.

One that creates growth and cuts carbon.

By improving the links that move goods and people around, encouraging people to travel sustainably, and targeting investment in new projects that promote green growth, we can help to build the balanced, dynamic low carbon economy that is essential for our future prosperity.

This White Paper, with the associated Local Sustainable Transport Fund, demonstrates our commitment to taking this agenda forward.

I commend it to the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110119,Rail franchise reform,"Written statement by the The Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Rt Hon Theresa Villiers):** I am today launching two publications on rail franchising. The first sets out the [Government's current thinking on franchising](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110504011839/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-28/), taking account of the results of the July 2010 consultation, Reforming Rail Franchising. That consultation proposed a variety of policy changes. It made clear our determination to deliver a railway which takes greater account of passenger needs; provides value for taxpayer investment; and delivers the right incentives for operators.

Since the close of the Reforming Rail Franchising consultation in October 2010, the Department has carefully considered the full range of responses, and has discussed the ideas in more detail with industry representatives.

We are now publishing the results of that analysis. Key principles emerging from that work include:

(i) the specifics of each franchise will be decided on a case by case basis, with bidders having a greater role in helping Government define the specification;

(ii) we will set demanding outcomes for operators to deliver but we will give them more flexibility to decide how best to achieve those outcomes, giving greater space to operators to plan and run their services in a more commercial manner;

(iii) longer franchises should expand the opportunity for operators to invest in improvements as well as enabling them to strengthen their working relationships with Network Rail and other key stakeholders.

We also believe that it is vital that the cost of running the railways comes down.

The second publication is a public consultation for the new [InterCity West Coast (ICWC) franchise](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110504011309/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2011-01/). A notice was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) last week at which time a formal accreditation process for bidders also started.

Our overall aim for the new franchise is to take as a starting point the much enhanced operations of recent years and improve these still further, while delivering value for money and meeting affordability requirements.

The ICWC franchise will build on the new timetable that was introduced in December 2008 and made possible by the £9 billion of public funds invested in infrastructure enhancement on the West Coast Main Line. This upgrade has shortened journey times and enabled more trains to be run. It has also delivered a more regular service timetable to Birmingham and Manchester.

Bidders for the franchise will be required to make proposals for the most advantageous deployment of the four additional 11-car Pendolino trains that will be available to them. These new trains will enable the new franchise operator to offer more capacity, more frequent trains and shorter journey times to various locations.

The new operator will need to consider how best to improve the performance and reliability of long distance services and the quality of service received by passengers across the franchise. They will be expected to put forward ideas for improving the passenger experience on board trains, providing better service information for passengers, and investing in station facilities.

The new ICWC franchise will begin operation on Sunday 1 April 2012. The franchise is proposed to last for a term of at least 14 years, aligned to the possible introduction of services on High Speed 2. Provisions will be included in the contract to allow for an earlier termination in the event of persistent under-performance by the operator.

The consultation document highlights the key requirements that the Department is considering including within the Invitation to Tender (ITT), for example, proposals to provide operators more flexibility and encourage investment. Responses to the consultation will inform the development of the ITT which we expect to publish in summer 2011, with the franchise awarded in late 2011.

Over the coming weeks the Department will carry out extensive discussions with local stakeholders, via a series of meetings.

The consultation will run until the 21 April 2011. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the House Library and are available on the Department for Transport website.

A notice was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) last week in relation to the Greater Anglia franchise and a formal accreditation process for bidders has begun. This will be a short-term contract lasting from February 2012 to at least the summer of 2013.

Letting this contract will enable us to include appropriate recommendations from the rail value for money study being led by Sir Roy McNulty in a new  long term franchise starting in 2013.

We will not be conducting a public consultation on this contract as the services that are being offered will be largely the same as those in operation today. However, there will be a full public consultation on the long term franchise before it is let.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110203,Drivers' medical standards,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department for Transport has today published a consultation on proposals for changes to the driver medical standards on eyesight, epilepsy and diabetes.

The current driver licensing rules in the UK are based on the second European Council Directive on driving licences (91/439/EEC). The minimum medical standards for the issue of driving licences are detailed in Annex III of the second directive and the forthcoming third European Directive on driving licences. Officials and medical experts from across the European Union reviewed the standards for eyesight, diabetes and epilepsy. Following receipt of their reports to the European Commission, amendments to the standards were adopted in 2009 in directives 2009/112/EC and 2009/113/EC, and came into force 15 September 2010.

The Secretary of State's experts on the Honorary Medical Advisory Panels for eyesight, diabetes and neurology have considered the medical directives and how these compare with existing UK standards. For the most part the medical directives relax or more precisely define existing EU minimum medical standards. While UK standards must be at least at the level of a minimum standard we are not required by EU law to relax existing domestic standards where these are higher than the EU standards. However, where the Panel has advised that a relaxation is consistent with road safety we are recommending that this is adopted. The implementation of these revised standards is the basis of the consultation.

The consultation period will run until 28 April 2011. Copies of the consultation document have been placed on the Library of the House. Further copies are available on the DfT and DVLA websites at www.dft.gov.uk or www.dvla.gov.uk. Depending on comments received and the Department's response, amendment for any change will be made to regulations or guidance issued to medical practitioners.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110203,Reform of the Air Travel Organiser's Licensing (ATOL) scheme,"Written statement by the The Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** I am today announcing the Government's 'in principle' decision to reform the Air Travel Organiser's Licensing (ATOL) scheme to improve clarity for consumers about its coverage and also to put the scheme's finances back on a sustainable basis.  There will be a full consultation on the details of the proposed reforms.

The ATOL scheme, operated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), was introduced in the 1970s to provide financial protection for the purchase of package holidays in the event of travel company insolvency.  Affected passengers are entitled to a full refund if they are yet to travel, or repatriation after completing their holiday if they have already reached their destination.

However, as a result of new ways of selling holidays and a recent Court ruling, the scheme no longer completely fulfils its intended purpose:  the proportion of holidays with ATOL protection has fallen, and it can be difficult for consumers and the travel industry to know which holidays are protected and which are not.  The proposed reforms will make it easier for everyone to understand which holidays are covered, and will restore protection to what looks like a package holiday but now falls outside the legal definition.

The Air Travel Trust Fund (the Fund) provides the money for refunds and repatriation costs when a travel company becomes insolvent.  For historic reasons the Fund had no income for a number of years.  As a result of this legacy, combined with travel company failures in 2008 and 2010, the Fund's deficit has increased significantly.  Until it is back in surplus, it can only meet its obligations because of a Government guarantee, currently £42m, in support of commercial borrowing facilities.  Reform is needed to secure the sustainability of the Fund so it can continue to provide financial protection for consumers, while reducing and eventually eliminating the exposure to taxpayers.  It is envisaged that the ATOL Protection Contribution (APC) paid into the Fund will remain at £2.50 per holiday sale until the Fund is restored to health.

The last Government consulted on reforming the ATOL scheme in December 2009, and the Coalition has continued work on developing these important reforms.  In outline the proposed reforms would:

  * create a new category of 'flight plus' holiday in ATOL.  This would cover holidays including a flight where the various elements were purchased within a specified short time period, and so look similar to package holidays, but are not packages as currently legally defined in the UK.  New secondary legislation would be required to do this.
  * ensure that where businesses sell holidays that look like packages, but where the travel agent has arranged matters so they are acting as an 'agent for the customer' and so remain outside of ATOL, consumers are made fully aware of this, so that they can make an informed decision about their purchase.  We are looking at using the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 to enforce this measure.
  * replace the current arrangements with clearer, standardised information for consumers that their holiday or flight is ATOL protected.  The CAA has already begun discussions with the industry about a recognised document, the ATOL Certificate, that would be both proportionate and fit for purpose. This can be done by CAA using its existing powers.

A consultation on the details of the proposals, including draft secondary legislation, is planned for the spring, with the aim of implementation by late 2011 or early 2012.

I believe there may also be a case for new primary legislation to address other issues in the ATOL scheme and will be considering that further in the course of this year.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110204,Investment in Local Major Transport Schemes: Update,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Philip Hammond):** On 26 October, following the announcement of the conclusions of the Spending Review, I made a statement to the House outlining our plans for investing over £1.5 billion over the next four years on major capital transport schemes promoted by Local Authorities. I also set out a process for deciding which schemes would receive funding and published details in a document entitled ""Investment in Local Major Transport Schemes"". I am today announcing the first set of decisions in line with the process as set out.

First, we announced in October a pool of ten Local Authority schemes with very high value for money or large local contributions that we wished to support. However we challenged the local authority promoters to reduce the cost to the exchequer and to submit revised funding bids.

I am pleased to say that through this process we have saved £45.5m on these schemes - 14% of the previously approved sums and I am pleased to confirm funding for the following schemes.

  * Leeds Station Southern Access: Improving pedestrian access to Leeds station (£12.4m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.4m)
  * Midland Metro Extension: Extending Midland Metro tram line through Birmingham City Centre (£75.4m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £129.2m)
  * Mansfield Public Transport Interchange: A new bus station and associated transport improvements in Mansfield (£7.2m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £8.9m)
  * Thornton to Switch Island Link: A new single carriageway road which will take traffic away from communities in Sefton (£14.5m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £18.6m)
  * Ipswich Fit for the 21st Century: An integrated package of sustainable transport improvements in Ipswich (£18.3m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £21.5m)
  * East of Exeter: Improvements to M5 J29, east of Exeter, providing access to new housing and employment areas (£10.4m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.4m)
  * Heysham to M6 Link Road: A bypass to the north of Lancaster, connecting Heysham to the M6 (£110.9m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £123.3m)
  * A57 M1 to Todwick Crossroads: Improvements on the A57 east of M1 J31, near Todwick (£11.8m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.7m)
  * Taunton Northern Inner Distributor Road: A new road in Taunton to provide additional cross town capacity and access to areas of brownfield land (£15.2m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £21.7m)

These schemes will now be able to progress towards construction subject to securing any remaining necessary planning and statutory approvals and subject to confirmation of value for money where material changes have been proposed.

For the remaining scheme in the Supported Pool, the Mersey Gateway Bridge, we are carefully considering a funding proposal from the promoters, Halton Borough Council. As this is the largest scheme with the most complex funding proposal of any scheme in the Supported Pool, we are not able to announce final funding arrangements at this point, but will do so as soon as possible.

I also announced in October a Development Pool of 22 schemes on which funding decisions would be made by the end of 2011, and a Pre-Qualification Pool of 34 schemes on which we would make an earlier decision on which should join the Development Pool.

I can today announce the promotion to the Development Pool of 23 schemes from the Pre-Qualification Pool, making an expanded Development Pool of 45 schemes, based on their potential to offer value for money, their ability and willingness to offer savings to the DfT and, in the case of five structural maintenance schemes, the potential importance of the work to the integrity of the existing road network. The local authority promoters of these 23 schemes have indicated a potential to reduce the call on DfT funds that would amount to an overall saving of 42% on the total of the previously requested sums. I am encouraged by this and I look forward to working with the promoters of these and the existing Development Pool schemes to try to achieve further savings when the promoters of all schemes in the Pool submit their Best and Final Funding Bids by September 2011.

As we set out in October, we do not expect that all schemes in the Development Pool will be funded. We will scrutinise the business case for each scheme very carefully and challenge promoters to demonstrate high value for money as well as significant savings on cost. We will also look at a range of other criteria, including deliverability and strategic fit, and will seek the views of interested parties including, where appropriate, Local Enterprise Partnerships. The process remains competitive and those schemes that do not reach an acceptable standard will not be funded.

In respect of the schemes from the Pre-Qualification Pool not selected for the Development Pool, promoters will need to consider their options. Beyond this Spending Review period my intention remains that we should move to a more devolved funding framework for major schemes with Local Enterprise Partnerships and others. I will develop this framework further during 2011.

It may be that for some of these schemes there remains a reasonable prospect of funding through this route or with alternative funding sources.  But there also needs to be realism. I would urge promoters of the non-selected schemes to consider, in consultation with the business community and local residents, whether further investment in the development of these schemes would be in the best interests of local council tax payers.

This Government is committed to transparency in decision making. I have placed on the DfT website a written document, as an update to ""Investment in Local Major Transport Schemes"", which sets out the details of these scheme approval decisions and explains the rationale on which they have been based. The document also includes the Benefit to Cost Ratios and Net Present Values, as estimated in the Spending Review, of Supported Pool and original Development Pool schemes. I will also place on the DfT website the Best and Final Funding Bids and Expressions of Interest that have been submitted by the Local Authority promoters.

In mid December, the Preferred Bidder in the SAR-H competition, Soteria, voluntarily came forward to inform the government of irregularities regarding the conduct of their bid team which had only then recently come to light. The irregularities included access by one of the consortium members, CHC Helicopter, to commercially sensitive information regarding the joint MOD/DfT project team's evaluations of industry bids and evidence that a former member of that project team had assisted the consortium in its bid preparation, contrary to explicit assurances given to the project team.

Since December, our two Departments have been working with Soteria to better understand the situation and its implications for the procurement process. In addition, the Ministry of Defence Police are investigating how the commercially sensitive information came to be in the possession of the bidder. It would be inappropriate to comment further on the details of the investigation until it has finished.

However, even without the outcome of that investigation, the Government has sufficient information to enable it to conclude that the irregularities that have been identified were such that that it would not be appropriate to proceed with either the preferred bid or with the current procurement process.

The Department for Transport and the Ministry of Defence will now consider the potential procurement options to meet future requirements for search and rescue helicopters in the United Kingdom, including options to maintain continuity of search and rescue helicopter cover until new longer term arrangements can be put in place.

We will make a further announcement once a way forward has been agreed.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110214,Blue Badge Reform programme,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am today publishing the Government's plans for [reforming the Blue Badge (Disabled Parking) Scheme](/topics/access/blue-badge/reform-of-the-blue-badge-scheme/). The measures that I am announcing will help those who rely on Blue Badges for mobility reasons. The measures will tackle rising levels of fraud and abuse, and will ensure both that badges are issued more fairly and that the scheme remains sustainable in the long term for those who rely on it most. These reforms will be delivered as soon as possible, and many within a year.

The Scheme helps over 2.5 million disabled people in England retain their independence, by enabling them to park close to jobs, services and facilities. However very few changes have been made to the scheme since it was established in the 1970s. Having listened to the views of badge holders, the general public, disabled people's groups and local authorities, it is evident that the scheme needs to be modernised to reduce current problems and deal with future challenges.

I want to ensure that the scheme focuses better on those whom it was intended to benefit. In particular, this means targeting those people who misuse and abuse it to the disadvantage of genuine badge holders. Secondly, this means ensuring that people have fair and equal access to the concession and the benefits it offers, regardless of where they live.

We are providing improved powers for local authorities to tackle abuse and fraud. This includes extending the grounds available to local authorities to refuse to issue and to withdraw badges and providing local authorities with a power to cancel badges that have been lost, stolen, have expired, or have been withdrawn for misuse. We are also providing local authority-authorised officers with an on-the-spot power to recover badges that have been cancelled or misused. We propose to amend existing legislation to clarify wrongful use of a badge and the powers to inspect badges.

To prevent abuse from happening in the first place and to deal with rising levels of fraud and abuse, we are implementing a new badge design that is harder to copy, forge and alter. Arrangements for printing, personalising and distributing the badge are also being changed and will enable more effective monitoring of cancelled, lost and stolen badges.

We are establishing, with local authorities, a common service delivery project which could deliver operational efficiency savings of up to £20m per year, help to reduce and prevent abuse and improve customer services. The project will also make available an on-line application facility which should result in faster, more automatic renewals for people whose circumstances do not change between renewal periods.

In order to ensure that badges are issued more fairly and consistently across the country, we are amending legislation to require wider use of independent mobility assessments to determine eligibility, including where previously that assessment was carried out by a GP. To support this, we are providing local authorities with control of the current National Health Service spend on Blue Badge assessments. In addition, new good practice guidance will be issued to local authorities to help them make improvements in scheme administration and eligibility assessment.

We are extending eligibility for a badge to some other people, to address current anomalies and issues of fairness. Eligibility is being extended to more disabled children between the ages of 2 and 3 with specific medical conditions and we are providing continuous automatic entitlement to a badge to severely disabled service personnel and veterans. We also intend to remove residency requirements for disabled service personnel and their families who are posted overseas on UK bases. This will enable them to apply for a badge.

To help cover costs more appropriately and to enable the delivery of a new badge design and the common service improvement project, we are raising the maximum fee for a badge that local authorities can charge from the £2 that it has been for nearly 30 years, to £10. The average benefit for badge holders from having a badge (and not having to pay parking charges) is estimated to be £300 over the three years for which most badges are valid. In return, badge holders will benefit from less abuse, improved accessibility and better customer services.

I am also publishing today, a [summary of responses to a public consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-20/) on the scheme.

The tool fully supports Local Authorities in making their own decisions about the carbon benefits of small scale interventions and enables them to input their own assumptions and data from best estimates of take-up and effects for their areas. The tool also brings together in one place central research on local transport and carbon, improves access to national transport data which can impact on emissions and simplifies carbon appraisal guidance.

The tool can assist authorities in demonstrating the carbon benefits of bids to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, but it is for Local Authorities to decide what tools and evidence best meet the criteria and objectives of the Fund in the context of their overall bids. My Department plans to publish the final tool in the summer. My officials have sent a letter to all Local Authority Chief Executives inviting views on the tool. A copy of this letter has been placed in the House library.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110216,Crossrail - Woolwich Station,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** I am pleased to inform the House today of a positive conclusion to discussions with Berkeley Homes on the funding of Woolwich Station Box.

In 2007, an initial Agreement was reached between Crossrail Ltd, the Department for Transport, Transport for London and Berkeley Homes. This Agreement stated that Berkeley Homes would build the basic box structure of a station at Woolwich and subsequently construct their own extensive mixed use development above it. This would be done at Berkeley Homes' cost and risk, to the specification laid down by Crossrail Ltd, in a way that ensured that the Woolwich Station Box did not add to the current cost of Crossrail. This Agreement was outlined to Parliament by the then Secretary of State for Transport in March 2007.

The Department for Transport, Crossrail Limited, Transport for London, and Berkeley Homes, have in recent months been working urgently to turn this initial Agreement into a final, legally binding, agreement.

I am therefore pleased to inform the House today that a final Agreement has now been reached by all parties. This means that engineering work on Woolwich Station Box can now proceed and the benefit of Crossrail investment can be secured for the residents of Woolwich.

In due course, fit-out of the Woolwich Station Box would be required to bring it to operational status. Government is clear that, in line with the 2007 agreement, no additional public sector contribution can be made available to fund the fit-out of the Station Box. Instead, the fit-out is conditional on receiving sufficient funding contributions from developers and businesses operating in the area. Berkeley Homes has an obligation to enter into discussions with Department for Transport, Transport for London, Crossrail Ltd and Greenwich Council, in order to provide for the subsequent fitting-out of the Station Box. All parties, including Berkeley Homes, have made clear that they understand and support this position.

I shall update the House as and when progress is made in relation to the private-sector funding of the station fit-out.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110216,Informal EU Transport Council,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** I attended the Informal Meeting of EU Transport Ministers, organised by the Hungarian Presidency in Budapest and Godollo on 7 and 8 February. The theme was: ""TEN-T revision: towards a long term, well-balanced European transport network"".

In the plenary debates, I put forward the UK view that the future TEN-T budget should take account of the aftermath of the financial crisis and the need to put recovery on a strong footing. EU funding will be limited and should be focused on projects that deliver real benefits to the network. Cost benefit analysis should inform funding decisions. Member States should aim to do more with less, concentrating on projects that deliver the best value for money. We think that the current model should be followed, focusing funding on the core network, with some funding also available for the comprehensive network.

In the debate on the role of PPPs, I pointed out that PPP is only appropriate in selected circumstances, implementation can present challenges and requires a high level of commercial skills, and particular attention needs to be paid to the long term budgetary consequences of its use. I cited the M6 toll road and River Severn Crossings as good examples of private investment enabling major pieces of infrastructure to be constructed and the cost returned through tolling. I said that the UK Government is open to tolling as an option for brand new alignments, with potential private sector investment, but noted that we have ruled out the introduction of a national road user charging scheme (except in relation to Heavy Goods Vehicles).

In the margins of the event I was pleased to be able to have a meeting with the Vice President of the European Commission responsible for transport, Mr Siim Kallas, to discuss a range of current issues.

During my discussion of airport security scanners with Mr Kallas, I welcomed the Commission's general approach to the deployment of scanners. We now need to move quickly to amend existing European legislation to give airports the flexibility to deploy scanners effectively and efficiently. The decision on whether to deploy security scanners should be for Member States. We acknowledge health, data protection and privacy concerns and believe that these can be addressed through existing European and national laws.

I also discussed the transport aspects of transposition of the Air Quality Directive with Mr Kallas. I pointed out that, although we are fully committed to improving air quality, and we recognise the part that transport has to play, we are keen to ensure that the air quality targets are properly targeted at improvements in health, and are consistent with our ambitious goals to reduce carbon and to create growth.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110228,High Speed Rail,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** Today, I am launching the [consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk) on the Government's proposals for a national high speed rail network.

High Speed Rail: Investing in Britain's Future sets out the Government's case for this network, the details of the Government's strategy, and the proposed route for an initial phase from London to the West Midlands. It will be one of the most extensive national consultations ever undertaken.

I believe that a national high speed rail network from London to Birmingham, with onward legs to Leeds and Manchester, could transform Britain's competitiveness as profoundly as the coming of the railways in the 19th century. It would reshape Britain's economic geography, helping bridge the north-south divide though massive improvements in journey times and better connections between cities - slashing almost an hour off the trip from London to Manchester.

But the proposed High Speed Rail network would do more: It would address Britain's future transport capacity challenge - providing a huge uplift in long distance capacity and relieving pressure on overstretched conventional lines. It would bring around £44 billion of net monetised benefits and support the creation of thousands of new jobs, as well as delivering unquantifiable strategic benefits. And it would help us to build a sustainable economy - by encouraging millions of people out of cars and off planes onto trains. Our competitors already recognise the huge benefits of high speed rail and are pressing ahead with ambitious plans. Britain cannot afford to be left behind.

The Government's support for high speed rail was set out clearly in its Programme for Government, published in May last year. Since then, we have built upon the work already done by [HS2 Ltd](http://www.hs2.org.uk/) to consider the case for high speed rail in the UK. Last October's Spending Review settlement reaffirmed our support and provided over £750 million to fund the development of our national network proposals over the next four years.

Since then, Government has received additional advice from HS2 Ltd on options for a national high speed rail network and on direct links to Heathrow and the High Speed 1 (HS1) line to the Channel Tunnel.

The Government understands the concerns of those living near the proposed route. Following a series of visits I made along the proposed London-West Midlands line, we have altered around half the original route - significantly reducing the potential local environmental impacts.

In the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, all but 1.2 miles would be in tunnel, cutting, or close to the A413 road corridor. Since HS2 Ltd's original report to Government was published in March 2010, the number of properties where high noise levels would be expected to be experienced has fallen from 350 to around 10.

In December 2010, I set out our proposed high speed rail strategy, our preferred route and our approach to delivering a wider high speed network.

However, we recognise that decisions should not be taken on a major infrastructure project of this scale until all those with an interest have had their say. So this [consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk) - **which will run until 29 July** - seeks views on: the case for high speed rail; our strategy for a national high speed network; the proposed route for an initial line from London to the West Midlands; and our options for providing assistance to those who are detrimentally affected by any new line. Responses can be submitted through the HS2 Consultation website, or sent to a freepost address.

Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Library of the House and are available on the DfT website. I am also publishing a number of more detailed supporting documents, including a detailed economic case, a full Appraisal of Sustainability and a route engineering report.

My Department will be conducting a series of regional seminars to inform the strategic debate, together with a series of roadshows along the line of the proposed London-West Midlands route. These will give people the chance to discuss our plans and the specific local impacts and mitigation proposals with the engineers and other specialists working on the project.

This is a once in a generation infrastructure investment that would have a transformational effect on Britain's economy. Civic leaders of all political persuasions and business leaders from all parts of the United Kingdom support it. I urge all Hon. Members with an interest to encourage their constituents to participate in the consultation. I will announce the outcome of this consultation process and the Government's decisions on its strategy for high speed rail before the end of 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110228,Local and regional rail services,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** Local authorities and Integrated Transport Authorities from time to time wish to develop proposals for new or enhanced rail services where, in their view, they offer the best way of meeting the transport needs of their area.  They have the necessary powers to secure the provision of such services but they are sometimes inhibited by the risk that significant revenue funding may need to be committed over the long term.  I am keen to encourage local bodies to identify the best solutions for identified local needs and therefore wish to ensure that they are not deterred from considering an improved rail service where it clearly offers value for money.

The Government's priority remains one of reducing the budget deficit and, therefore, careful consideration has to be given to any proposal which might increase the cost of the railway, either in the short or long term. However, we recognise the arguments put forward by promoters that regional and local rail services need to adapt to population, housing and economic growth in localities. Therefore, it is only right that, once they have demonstrated value for money after a trial period, new or improved services promoted by local authorities are treated in a similar way to the more established services which are currently funded as part of the national network.

I would therefore like to announce to the House that the Government still intends to fund the provision of new or enhanced services promoted by authorities which have rail industry support, but in view of the tough financial decisions made as part of the Spending Review, no such funding will be provided prior to April 2015 (the start of the next Spending Review period).

It is important that the promoter demonstrates that a rail scheme is the best way to address regional and local transport issues; hence promoters would still be expected to fund a new or enhanced service for the first three years to demonstrate its commitment to the service and show that it delivers value for money in the light of actual experience.

Schemes which the Department would consider funding in this way would be subject to a number of conditions, details of which have been deposited in the library of the House and will be made available on the Department for Transport's web site.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110301,Intercity Express and Rail Electrification,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the Government's plans for extension of the electrification of the Great Western Main Line and for the procurement of a replacement for the existing diesel intercity trains. These two issues are closely connected.

I turn first to the provision of a new generation of intercity 125 mile per hour trains to take advantage of the electrification of the Great Western Main Line and to allow the phasing out of most of the ageing diesel ""Intercity 125s"".

In February 2009 the Intercity Express Programme, launched by the previous Government, identified Agility Trains, a consortium of Hitachi Rail (Europe) Ltd and John Laing Plc, as the preferred bidder to provide a new fleet of intercity trains. Subsequently, the previous Government placed this process on hold and ordered a review of the procurement by Sir Andrew Foster.

Last summer, recognising the fiscal challenges the UK faces and also recognising the impact of the new Government's plans for high speed rail to Leeds and Manchester, Agility put forward an improved, lower cost, proposal, which provides the required service through a mixed IEP fleet: some all electric trains; and some with a combination of electric and diesel power, allowing them to operate through services beyond the electrified railway. This proposal retained the more modern electric Intercity 225s on the East Coast Main Line, as the previous administration had proposed.

We have reviewed this proposal against the alternative of an all-electric fleet, with purpose built diesel locomotives being coupled to trains to haul them beyond the electrified railway.

Either way, this would represent a multi-billion pound investment for this country underpinning the operation of intercity services on the conventional railway for many years to come, and it is imperative that the right choice is made.

As I said at the time of my statement to the House on 25 November, there were complex legal, technical and commercial issues to be addressed. Both the Government and Agility Trains as preferred bidder recognised this.

Over the last few months we have worked together on these issues and I can now announce that I am resuming the IEP procurement and proceeding with the proposal that Agility Trains have put forward as preferred bidder.

We will now work with Agility Trains with a view to reaching financial close by the end of this year. This is, of course, subject to the Government continuing to be satisfied that the proposal offers value for money as the commercial negotiations are concluded and that the final arrangements are compliant with the United Kingdom's EU obligations.

This deal will allow us to provide better, faster, more comfortable services and to continue providing through-journeys between London and parts of the rail network which are not electrified.

In total, there will be over 11,000 more peak time seats each day on the Great Western Main Line and East Coast Main Line post IEP, compared to today.

Hitachi is today confirming its plans to locate its European train manufacturing and assembly centre at Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. This investment is expected to create at least five hundred direct permanent jobs as well as hundreds of temporary construction jobs. Thousands more job opportunities will be created in the UK manufacturing and service supply chains.

Coming just days after the news of the re-opening of the Redcar Steel Works, this is a massive - and very welcome - shot in the arm for the skilled work forces of the North East's industrial heartland.

I turn now to the related issue of electrification of the Great Western Main Line. I announced to the House on 25 November that, over the next six years, Network Rail will electrify the commuter services on the Great Western Main Line from London to Didcot, Oxford and Newbury. I recognise that this announcement, although welcomed in the Thames Valley, left unanswered the clear aspirations of rail users further west for the extension of electrification to Bristol and into Wales. I and my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Wales have subsequently considered the options for extending electrification, alongside the Government's consideration of the proposals for replacement of the current diesel Intercity trains, and in close consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government.

We have concluded that there is a case for extending electrification westwards to Bristol and Cardiff and I am today asking Network Rail to add this major extension to their electrification programme immediately.

This is good news for Wales and the South West - against a backdrop of public spending constraint as we deal with the legacy of debt we have inherited. Bringing electrification to Cardiff will mean that we are linking, for the first time, the capital cities of England, Scotland and Wales by electrified rail.

These measures will deliver a London to Cardiff journey time of an hour and 42 minutes and will shave 22 minutes off the London to Bristol journey.

I have received representations calling for electrification of the Great Western Main Line to be extended as far west as Swansea and we have looked carefully at the arguments. The business case for electrification is heavily dependant on the frequency of service. Services between London and Swansea currently operate at a frequency of only one train an hour off-peak. There is no evidence of a pattern of demand that would be likely to lead imminently to an increase in this frequency. Consequently, I regret to say that there is not, at present a viable business case for electrification of the mainline between Cardiff and Swansea.

But, because of the decision to proceed with Agility's proposal for a bi-mode train, journey times from London to Swansea will be shortened to two hours and 39 minutes - 20 minutes faster than today - with trains switching automatically to diesel power as they leave Cardiff. Because the constraining factor on the South Wales Main Line is speed limitations dictated by the geometry of the line, there would be no time saving benefits from electrifying the line from Cardiff to Swansea.

However, the policy of the Government is to support a progressive electrification of the rail network in England and Wales, for environmental, among other reasons. My Rt Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for Wales, and I will therefore keep under active review the business case for future electrification of the Great Western Main Line between Cardiff and Swansea in the light of developing future service patterns.

I have a further announcement to make to the House. In the course of the examination of the case for electrification in South Wales that I and my Rt Hon Friend have undertaken, we have established, at an initial high level, that a good case appears to exist for electrifying the key valley commuter lines north of Cardiff via Pontypridd and Caerphilly to Treherbert, Aberdare, Merthyr Tydfil, Coryton and Rhymney, as well as the lines to Penarth and Barry Island to the west. My Department will therefore work with the Welsh Assembly Government to develop a full business case for the electrification of the Cardiff Valley lines within the next rail investment control period beginning in 2014.  The Welsh Assembly Government will need, in parallel, to consider the case for specifying suitable electric trains for these routes when the Wales and Borders franchise is re-let in 2018. This would, of course, be a prerequisite for electrification to proceed, and the timetable for franchise re-letting, and re-specification, necessarily dictates the timescale of this proposed electrification.

On the basis of our preliminary evaluation, the Valleys electrification represents the best value for money rail electrification investment that can be made in Wales. It promises to bring all the benefits of electric commuter trains - faster acceleration, greater comfort and cleaner, greener travel, as well as greater reliability - to rail users in South Wales.  It would have a significant effect on the economy of Cardiff and the Valleys - deepening labour markets, improving connectivity and significantly enhancing the attractiveness of the area to investors.

Coupled with the electrification of the Great Western Main Line, this represents a major boost to the economy of South Wales as a whole.

These three decisions, on Intercity Express, Great Western Main Line electrification and to build a business case for electrification of the Valley commuter lines, represent a major further investment in UK rail infrastructure - following the announcements I have already made on Crossrail, Thameslink, Tube upgrades, Thames Valley and North Western electrification and additional rolling stock.

They sit alongside the Government's proposals for High Speed Rail, the [consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk) on which I announced to the House in a written statement yesterday, as testimony to this Government's commitment to investment in the future of Britain's railways.

They represent excellent news for passengers on the Great Western Main Line and the East Coast Main Line, for commuters on the Cardiff Valley lines, and for the economies of South Wales and North East England as a whole.

I commend this statement to the House.

Today I am announcing that legislation to implement these reforms will be introduced early in the next session.

[Reforming the framework for airport economic regulation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/airports/economic-regulation-of-airports/#) will help improve the quality of service that passengers receive at designated airports and contribute positively to economic growth.

As I set out in my statement to the House on 21 July 2010, we plan to replace the existing statutory framework for regulation at designated airports with a more flexible licence based system. This will give the CAA the powers it needs to become a more responsive regulator, for example to deal with events such as the severe weather this winter. The reforms will also strip out unnecessary regulation and support passenger-focussed investment in existing airport infrastructure.

I am keen to ensure that there is a smooth transition to the new regime and we will work with the CAA and industry to achieve this. In particular, the Government will not be making changes to the basis on which the current price caps at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are set.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110307,Olympic Airspace,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** As part of the commitment to deliver a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Government is today announcing its plans for temporary airspace control measures that will apply over London and the South East during the Games period.

The measures comprise an inner prohibited airspace zone and an outer restricted zone, approximately 60 nautical miles across, centred on the Olympic Park.

Only certain categories of aircraft - those operating commercial services and subject to full security procedures - will normally be permitted to operate within the Prohibited Zone. Certain aircraft involved in, for example, Police, Medevac and Olympic Broadcast operations will be exempted. Other operations at airports within this zone may also be considered for exemption subject to strict conditions, which will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Similarly, we are working with Battersea Heliport to agree a basis on which operations there may be allowed to continue.

All types of aircraft will be permitted to operate in the wider restricted zone provided that they can satisfy certain requirements designed to ensure that all aircraft within the zone can be readily identified and monitored by air traffic control.

It is envisaged that the measures will be in place **from 13 July to 12 September 2012**, to cover the period of both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

These measures have been designed to help to protect key Games locations from potential airborne threats. It is normal practice to implement airspace restrictions during large-scale events such as major sporting events, and similar measures have been put in place for previous Olympic and Paralympic Games. The measures have been developed to be proportionate and to minimise the impact on the aviation community during the summer of 2012.

It is not expected that any airports will need to close as a result of the measures. There should be no impact on scheduled air services, and limited impact on most other types of operation outside the prohibited zone.

The Government, the Civil Aviation Authority and NATS will now work with airspace users and others to ensure that the planned measures, and their potential impacts, are fully understood and discussed before the regulations to implement them under the Air Navigation Order 2009 are made later this year.

Options for airspace controls over other Olympics venues outside the South East are still being considered and plans for these will be announced later.

Copies of a leaflet entitled ""London 2012 Airspace,"" aimed at the general aviation community, showing the coverage of the zones and setting out in more detail the restrictions that will apply within them, have been placed in the Library.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110309,Supporting community transport,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Today, I am announcing £10-million of new funding to be distributed to rural local transport authorities to kick-start the development of community transport services in their area.

In addition, we have formed a partnership with the Community Transport Association to provide each of the 76 rural local authorities in England with £2,600 worth of consultancy advice on how to establish, manage and make sustainable community transport operations within their area. There is the option for local authorities to supplement this with their own funds to receive further services.

This additional funding complements our recently announced Local Sustainable Transport Fund, which allows local authorities to bid for a share of £560m over 4 years, aimed at encouraging sustainable transport solutions, including Community Transport, that will create economic growth and cut carbon.

Public transport remains a key element in the sustainability and independence of rural communities: offering young people access to education and employment opportunities; linking customers to shops and services; and providing a lifeline to those without access to a car.

Where commercial bus services are not viable, Community Transport can play a valuable role in preventing isolation. I therefore strongly encourage local authorities to work in partnership with operators and local communities to examine how more flexible services might be provided.

Services such as dial-a-ride can, in some areas, be more efficient, effective and sustainable in the long term. I know that there are already many good examples of community groups and local authorities working together to deliver innovative solutions to rural transport needs and this is something we wish to see increased.

Today's package of support for Community Transport represents an important opportunity to invest in the future to provide more sustainable transport for local communities.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110310,Consultation on Renewable Energy and Fuel Quality directives,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Biofuels have an important role to play in efforts to tackle climate change, particularly where there is no viable alternative fuel on the horizon, as is the case with aviation and HGVs. In addition, they also have a role to play in promoting the security of energy supply. But we firmly believe that the potential carbon benefits of biofuels can only be realised if they are produced in a sustainable way.

My Department recognises that there are legitimate concerns about the sustainability of some biofuels. Biofuels are a continually developing technology and there is still scientific uncertainty about the sustainability of biofuels and their wider socio-economic impacts.

Much work is underway to better understand indirect sustainability effects. It is crucial that we establish strong sustainability criteria and a robust lifecycle carbon analysis to ensure first that biofuels deliver real greenhouse gas reductions and second, do not cause unacceptable environmental side effects in the process.

In particular, my Department takes the issue of indirect land use change seriously. We have recently published research on the scale of indirect land use change impacts and we are continuing to lead work on how to tackle these. The European Commission is in the process of assessing a range of options to address the issue of indirect land use change and I have written to the EU Energy, Environment and Climate Commissioners to impress on them the need for an adequate and robust solution.

Given the uncertainties, I believe it is right that this Government has taken additional time to review the subject carefully. There have been shifts in biofuels policy in the past so we need to ensure that policy decisions going forward are robust and stable, which will also give confidence to business to invest.

In addition to concerns regarding the sustainability of biofuels, we must also consider where biofuels would be best deployed across the transport sector. It may be best to focus use of what may well be limited supplies of sustainably sourced biofuel in transport modes where no other low carbon energy source is likely to be viable.

In April 2010, my Department commissioned work to determine how best biofuels should be deployed across all transport modes. In addition, the Government tasked the Committee on Climate Change to review the level of ambition for renewable energy.  These pieces of work are due to conclude over the coming months. The evidence we gather about the best use of biofuels across modes will inform our view of likely levels of uptake.

Given that biofuels policy has wide implications, I will continue to engage with Ministerial colleagues across Whitehall to ensure that government policy on biofuels is aligned going forward.

Today, I am publishing separate consultations on proposals to implement the European Renewable Energy and Fuel Quality Directives. Both of these Directives contain requirements related to the use of biofuels.

The Renewable Energy Directive requires the UK, by 2020, to source 15% of its overall energy, and 10% of energy used in transport, from renewable sources. The related Fuel Quality Directive requires fuel and energy suppliers (principally those providing fuel and energy for land-based transport) to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the fuel/energy that they supply by 6 % per unit of energy by 2020.

Given the need to consider our developing evidence base, I do not propose to make any changes to the current biofuel supply trajectory that is set out in the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007. However, there will be a legal obligation on the Secretary of State to keep this issue under review and to consider what additional measures will be required to ensure that the UK delivers the requirements of the EU Renewable Energy and Fuel Quality Directives in the period 2014 to 2020. This approach should enable us to establish a stable biofuel policy that will allow industry to robustly plan for the period 2014 to 2020.

The two consultation documents set out proposals to implement the transport requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive through amendment of the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) and proposals to implement the Fuel Quality Directive through the amended RTFO and the proposed Motor Fuel Greenhouse Gas Saving Regulations.

Our implementation proposals involve making new provisions for biofuels to meet the EU biofuel sustainability criteria and introducing double certification for biofuels produced from wastes (such as used cooking oil) and other feedstocks that do not compete with food production or contribute to indirect land use change. In addition, we propose to put in place a 6% lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction obligation for 2020 and introduce requirements for the relevant fuel/energy suppliers to report on the lifecycle greenhouse gas performance of their fuels in the meantime.

The consultation period will run from today until 2 June and we aim to introduce and bring into force the relevant legislation completing the implementation of the transport elements of both Directives by the end of this year.

This exceptional decision has been made possible due to prudent management of Departmental expenditure, including additional efficiencies made this year.

The chosen Cycle Town projects Blackpool, Bristol, Cambridge, Colchester, Darlington, Derby, Exeter, Leighton Linslade, South Glos, Southend, Shrewsbury, Woking and York have been assessed as capable of being delivered within the current financial year whilst offering value for money. I believe this additional funding will assist in meeting the overall aims of the project to get more people cycling safely.  All the recommended projects fit well with the strategic objectives of the towns concerned and will increase the effectiveness of their existing programmes in generating additional cyclists.

The three Train Operating Companies, Merseyrail, South West Trains and Northern Rail, have worked hard, in partnership with local authorities and other organisations, including Sustrans and Network Rail, to deliver high-quality infrastructure improvements accompanied by promotional activities. This is with the aim of encouraging more cycling to railway stations and to deliver improved integration of bike and rail journeys. This money will enable further enhancements to these schemes.

Today's announcement complements, and is in addition to, our recently launched Local Sustainable Transport Fund which allows local authorities to bid for a share of £560m over four years, aimed at encouraging sustainable transport solutions, including Cycling initiatives, that will create economic growth and cut carbon.

This additional funding demonstrates the Government's continued commitment to cycling, recognising its potential contribution to reducing carbon emissions, improving health and creating economic growth.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110321,Drink and Drug-driving: Response to Sir Peter North CBE QC and the Transport Select Committee,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** I have today placed in the Library of the House the Government's response to a report by Sir Peter North on drink and drug driving which was published in June 2010.  This response also covers a report by the Transport Select Committee which was published in December 2010.  The Government's response is available on the Department's website - [www.dft.gov.uk](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/the-governments-response-to-the-reports-by-sir-peter-north-and-the-transport-select-committee/#).

The Government is committed to improving road safety.  It is a priority to deter driving when unfit through drugs or alcohol, and to ensure that those who persist in this dangerous behaviour are detected and punished effectively.  We must protect law-abiding road users with measures that are effective and proportionate, concentrating on those who are a danger to themselves and other road users, while avoiding unnecessary social and economic impacts.

We are convinced that our first priority must be to give the police the means to identify drug drivers and compel them to give evidential samples for testing.  It is just as dangerous for people to drive impaired by alcohol or drugs, and it is quite wrong that it is easier at present to get away with one than the other. There needs to be a clear message that drug drivers are as likely to be caught and punished as drink drivers and that drug driving is as socially unacceptable as drink driving.

We have taken the first steps to address this with a specification for drug testing equipment for the police.  We aim to have this available for use later this year.  We will - as Sir Peter suggested - examine the case for a new specific offence which would remove the need for the police to prove impairment on a case-by-case basis where a specified drug has been detected.  The introduction of fixed thresholds for blood-alcohol as the test for drink driving has delivered benefits to road safety that are clear for all to see.

Our strategy is to focus resources and any legislative changes on measures which will have the most impact in reducing dangerous behaviours.  There are therefore two main priorities -

  * to continue the successful abatement of drink driving and achieve similar success against drug driving by giving the police effective tools to identify and proceed against drink and drug drivers;
  * to streamline the enforcement process for drink and drug driving to remove pressure on police and other enforcement resources.

A staggering proportion of drink drivers are well over the current limit - 40% of those caught by the police are 2.5 times the limit.  The proportion of drivers over the limit who are killed is the same.  Their behaviour is entrenched and displays a flagrant disregard for the law and the safety of other road users. We have concluded that improving enforcement is likely to have most impact on these dangerous people, and will therefore be the most effective use of scarce resources, rather than lowering the prescribed alcohol limit for driving.

We will implement the following measures, bringing forward legislation where necessary at the earliest opportunity :

  * revoke the right to opt for a blood test when the evidential breath test result is less than 40% over the limit (the 'statutory option') as this causes delay which results in some offenders avoiding prosecution;
  * streamline the procedure for testing drink drivers in hospital;
  * close a loophole used by high risk offenders to delay their medical examinations;
  * require drink drivers who are substantially in excess of the limit to take remedial training and a linked driving assessment - as well as a medical examination - before recovering their licence;
  * re-launch the drink drive rehabilitation scheme under which drink drivers can get the period of their driving disqualification reduced if they complete an approved training course;
  * approve portable evidential breath testing equipment for the police -and provide for preliminary testing not to be required where evidential testing can be undertaken away from the police station;
  * approve preliminary drug-testing equipment, initially for use in police stations - and at the roadside as soon as possible;
  * delegate to custody nurses the assessment police doctors are now required to make of suspected drug-drivers;

Full impact assessments, including among other things the potential impacts on enforcement and the judicial system, will be prepared in the usual way when legislation is brought forward.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110330,Developing a Sustainable Framework for UK Aviation: Scoping Document,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** My Department's Business Plan confirmed the Coalition Government's decision not to support new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. It also committed the Government to create a sustainable framework for aviation in the UK. This framework will replace the previous administration's The Future of Air Transport white paper which, while recognising aviation's economic benefits, failed to take sufficient account of climate change and the impact of aviation on local communities. Today I am publishing a Scoping Document which aims to define the debate as we develop a new long-term policy for UK aviation.

The Government is committed to returning the UK to sustainable economic growth. Aviation has an important role to play in delivering that growth. It makes a significant contribution to the UK economy and provides the international connectivity this country needs to thrive in the highly competitive global economy. This Government wants to see aviation prosper. Aviation should be able to grow, but it must also play its part in delivering our environmental goals and protecting the quality of life of local communities.

The Government has made clear its commitment to meeting the challenge of climate change. Today, aviation contributes around six per cent of UK CO2 emissions but this share will increase as demand for air transport increases and other sectors of the economy reduce their emissions. The Scoping Document explores the most effective ways of addressing aviation's environmental impacts, both global and local, and seeks answers to questions on both issues.

The publication of this Scoping Document represents the start of a dialogue to give a wide range of stakeholders an opportunity to contribute to the development of the policy framework. I expect the views expressed to be varied, and sometimes difficult to reconcile, but I want to move the aviation debate on from the polarisation which has characterised it in recent years, towards a consensus which balances the benefits that aviation brings with its impacts, both global and local.

We will publish a draft policy framework for public consultation in March 2012, and formally adopt the framework by March 2013.

There will be a Progress Report and Policy Debate on the draft Regulation amending Regulation 1406/2002, which established the **European Maritime Safety Agency**. The proposed amendment gives the Agency several new, largely technical, tasks.  In principle, the UK would be able to support the proposals, subject to the Commission delivering the additional funding required through a programme of reprioritisation of the current EU budget.  It is also important for the UK to ensure that the extension of the Agency's marine pollution response capabilities to cover offshore oil and gas installations is at the request of an affected State only, and that any involvement in the analysis of the safety of these installations explicitly excludes activities or requirements related to the exploration or exploitation of mineral resources by means of a well.

There will be two agenda items on **global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)**.

There will be a progress Report and the Council will be asked to reach a General Approach on a Decision on rules for access to the public regulated service (PRS) of the Galileo system. I believe the text to be tabled for General Approach addresses the UK's earlier concerns covering costs, the framework for the manufacture of PRS receivers and associated material, and security standards.

There will be a policy debate and the Council will be asked to agree Conclusions following the Commission's recent mid-term review of the European programmes. The Government is deeply disappointed and concerned that the full Galileo programme cannot now be delivered within the budget or timescale agreed in 2007. A robust assessment of all options is needed in light of this. The Government considers that the programme should respect the 2007 budget by reducing its level of ambition. The draft Council Conclusions do not prejudice the forthcoming negotiations on the next multi-annual financial framework for the EU and urge the Commission to continue its cost analysis in order to identify options for cost reduction. They go on to underline the Council's wish that the cost analysis should result in cost savings. Accordingly, I expect to be able to agree to the Conclusions.

The Council will be asked to adopt two Decisions in the area of **aviation external relations**.

The first is a Decision on the signature and provisional application of a **Memorandum of Cooperation between the Community and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)**.  I intend to abstain on this proposal as I consider that it is necessary to put down a marker that the UK is concerned about the principle of Member State sovereignty in international organisations and cautious about any proposals which could have the effect of enhancing the role of the EU at the expense of Member States.

The second is a Decision authorising the Commission to **negotiate with Switzerland on an amendment to the existing Air Transport Agreement**. This will further remove barriers to market access on the basis of full application by Switzerland of the EU regulatory framework. The UK is supportive of the proposed negotiating mandate.

The Council may be asked to adopt a position on a Decision concerning the accession of the EU to the **Protocol of 2002 to the Athens Convention** relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974. A number of issues still need to be resolved. I will report to the House on this matter if it is considered at the Council.

I will be raising two issues under Any Other Business. The first is the importance of ensuring that the forthcoming **review of European air quality legislation** takes full account of transport issues The second is the need to make swift progress in delivering an enhanced regulatory regime for **air cargo security**.

If, as expected, the Commission's new **White Paper on transport policy** is published before the Council, the Commission will give a presentation on it under AOB. A debate on the White Paper will follow at a later Council, when Member States have given full consideration to it. Also under AOB, the Commission will report on the follow-up to the **volcanic ash crisis** of 2010, looking at the wider scope of crisis management and EU methodology.

In July-September 2010, a review of the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010, SI 2010 No. 1228, was conducted in view of concerns expressed about those Regulations.

The Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) (Amendment) Regulations 2010, SI 2010 No. 1769, delayed the commencement provisions of SI 2010 No. 1228 for six months (ie so that the earliest date any of its provisions would come into force was 1 April 2011), to ensure the provisions of SI 2010 No. 1228 did not come into force before the completion of the review.

Amending Regulations have been drafted, and work is in train to ensure that these amending Regulations take account of representations made. However, consideration of the impact of these regulations on business will take time and is unlikely to be completed until May at the earliest.

Accordingly, I am laying before the House a Statutory Instrument which will delay the commencement provisions of SI 2010 No. 1228 for a further six months (until the next Common Commencement Date, which is 1 October 2011), to ensure that the provisions of SI 2010 No. 1228 do not come into force on 1 April in their unamended form.

The current maximum permitted length of an articulated heavy goods vehicle is 16.5 metres, and the maximum length of semi-trailer compatible with that overall limit is 13.6 metres. However, the current maximum permitted length for a rigid vehicle/drawbar trailer combination is already 18.75 metres, so the new proposed maximum length for articulated goods vehicles would not mean longer vehicles than are already circulating on Britain's roads.

The proposal is based on research findings and an Impact Assessment. It would be a relaxation of the current regulatory requirement on the road haulage industry. The Government accepts the research findings which show it could have a significant potential net benefit to road haulage as well as wider benefits in terms of reductions in congestion, local air pollution, carbon emissions, accidents, noise and infrastructure costs.

In June 2009, following earlier work on longer, heavier vehicles, the Department for Transport commissioned a detailed study into the feasibility and impacts of allowing the use of longer semi-trailers in GB, within the existing weight limit of 44 tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW). The primary objective was to establish whether the introduction of these high-volume semi-trailers would deliver overall economic, environmental and societal benefits or disbenefits.

The study considered two main possibilities: increasing the length of a semi-trailer by up to one metre to 14.6 metre in total, or increasing it by up to 2.05 metres. The latter option would increase the maximum permitted length of a semi-trailer to 15.65 metres, which would provide the same loading length as an existing rigid truck/drawbar trailer combination.

The study also considered the possibility of increasing the overall maximum permitted length of an articulated lorry to 18.75 metres. This would enable the development and use of tractor units with safer, more aerodynamic frontal designs in addition to high-volume semi-trailers.

Based on the findings of the study, the Government believes there is a good case for permitting both an increase of up to 2.05 metres in the length of semi-trailers and an increase in the overall permitted length of articulated vehicles to 18.75 metres. The existing weight limit of 44 tonnes GVW will remain in force. The consultation will enable the Department to develop a better understanding of the practical implications on road users generally of such an increase and to identify proportionate mitigation measures to minimise the risk of unintended adverse consequences. Depending on the outcome of the consultation, the Government will consider permitting the operation of high-volume semi-trailers on a trial basis pending the introduction of the necessary changes to current Regulations.  This trial could be helpful to determine whether or not mitigation measures are required.

The consultation will run until 21 June 2011. Copies of the Consultation Document have been placed on the Library of the House. Further copies are available on the DfT website at [www.dft.gov.uk](http://www.dft.gov.uk/). Depending on comments received and the Department's response, amendments may be made to regulations.

The draft Directive intends to improve enforcement of certain road traffic offences committed using vehicles registered in another Member State. It aims to facilitate the exchange of registered keeper data between Member States' registration authorities, to help identify offenders.

While broadly supportive of the objectives behind this measure, the UK did not opt in to the Directive because, on balance, it did not appear to be in the UK's interests to do so at this stage.

In the UK we prosecute drivers for road traffic offences, rather than vehicle keepers. Given that the Directive only provides for the exchange of vehicle keeper information, we had concerns around our ability to effectively pursue fines against the drivers of the vehicles, in the absence of effective provision to compel foreign registered keepers to disclose who was driving the vehicle when the offence was committed.

We questioned the interaction of the Directive with the Prum Council Decisions, which the UK has signed up to, but not yet implemented, (""Prum"" provides for the exchange of keeper data between Member States in relation to criminal offences) and were concerned about how the necessary data protection mechanisms could be enforced.

Additionally, we did not consider that a fine would have enough of a deterrent effect to bring about increased behavioural change, since domestically, research shows that it is the fear of points on a licence, or losing the licence altogether which have the main effect on increasing compliance.

We also had concerns around affordability. There would be significant start-up and running costs were our police to use keeper information obtained under the proposed Directive for enforcement purposes.

Not opting in at this stage will give us the opportunity to carefully scrutinise the actual costs for setup and implementation of this Directive across Member States, informing any future decision on a possible post-adoption opt-in, which the Government will look at longer term.

A decision not to opt in to this particular Directive does not prevent the UK from engaging with the EU on other matters relating to road safety nor cooperating on enforcement and exchanging data where there are strong, mutual interests for this. The UK continues to plays a prominent part in developing EU strategy in these areas. We also expect that we will be able to continue to play a part in negotiating the final text of the Directive.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110427,Review of decision making in the Department for Transport,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** I am announcing today reforms to the way decisions are made on which transport projects to prioritise. My Department's Business Plan states we will ""reform the way transport projects are assessed and funding prioritisation decisions are made so that the benefits of low carbon proposals are fully recognised."" It specifies that in order to achieve this we will:

(a) review and revise DfT guidance on appraising transport projects, and

(b) review and revise DfT processes for assessing schemes and supporting Ministerial decisions.

The rest of this statement explains how we have met these commitments.

### DfT guidance on appraising transport projects

The evidence supporting decisions needs to be robust. Updates and changes that I am making to my Department's guidance on appraising transport projects will recognise the benefits of low carbon proposals more accurately.

Spending Review decisions were informed by a value-for-money measure, used across Government. This measure incorporated the latest monetary values of carbon, published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which are higher than previous values. It also treated indirect tax revenues (such as fuel duty) in a way consistent with the Department for Transport's 'in-draft' benefit-cost ratio (BCR) formula. These changes tend to improve the BCRs of schemes that reduce carbon emissions and weaken the BCRs of schemes that result in higher carbon emissions.

Stakeholder groups have made representations that the Department should consider amending the value of time to reflect regional variations in earnings. We have considered these representations and have decided not to make any change at this stage, but we will keep the issue under review.

Over the coming days, my officials will update the appraisal guidance to incorporate the higher carbon values and new BCR formula that were used in the Spending Review. In addition, the Department will also release further changes to the appraisal guidance that reflect Government's priorities and recent updates to values and methodologies. A full list of these changes can be found on the Department's website ([www.dft.gov.uk/webtag](http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/)).

### DfT processes for assessing schemes and supporting ministerial decisions

Today, my Department is publishing 'The Transport Business Case' which sets out the Department's approach to producing business cases that support ministerial decisions. This approach ensures decisions are made by taking account of all the relevant information set out in five cases, consistent with the Treasury Green Book, specifically, to show whether schemes:

  * are supported by a robust **case for change** that fits with wider public policy objectives - the 'strategic case';
  * demonstrate **value for money** - the 'economic case';
  * are **commercially viable** - the 'commercial case';
  * are **financially affordable** - the 'financial case'; and
  * are **achievable** - the 'management case'.

This means that there will no longer be a separate process called NATA.

### Option development and presentation

My department will revise the formats used to present information to support decision making so that all the five cases receive appropriate consideration from an early stage in a clear and transparent way. Forthcoming changes to the guidance will set out to scheme promoters how to develop a range of innovative solutions to transport problems in the early stages of option development and a clear process for option selection that aligns with the subsequent appraisal process. Today, I am also publishing the Early Assessment and Sifting Tool, which will aid scheme promoters in comparing and refining options in those early stages.

A link to the report is being provided on the Department for Transport website.

The consideration of this matter by the Committee on Toxicity (COT) in 2007 provided an important opportunity to examine this issue in depth. Further scrutiny was provided by the investigation carried out by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee.

The Department commissioned this independent research in 2008 (once tests had been completed to find suitable scientific equipment for the task) as a result of a recommendation by the COT - the first time such a study had been carried out by any country in the world.

The main conclusion of Cranfield's research was that there was no evidence of pollutants occurring in cabin air at levels exceeding available health and safety standards and guidelines. Levels observed in the flights that formed part of the study were comparable to those typically experienced in domestic settings.

The study monitored a total of 100 flights in five different aircraft types: Boeing 757, Airbus 319, 320 and 321 and the BAe 146. A series of air samples were taken at defined points on all flights, with additional samples taken during any 'fume events' if any occurred. All flight crew, cabin crew and researchers were requested to complete a post-flight questionnaire, including questions about any fumes or smells that occurred during the flight.

The study's objective was to analyse cabin air for volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, particles and carbon monoxide in normal operations during all phases of flight (e.g. climb, cruise, descent); and to detect and characterise any anomalous elevations of these elements during any 'fume events' where unusual smells or similar occurrences were reported.

The European standard 'Aircraft internal air quality standards, criteria and determination methods' sets safety, health and comfort limits for a number of substances, including two that were measured in the study - carbon monoxide and toluene. The study's results indicate that concentrations of both carbon monoxide and toluene remained within these limits. In the absence of specific cabin air standards for the other pollutants measured in the research, the study referred to other standards and guidelines established, for example, for domestic (home) or occupational environments. Again, none of these standards or guidelines was exceeded.

I am grateful to Cranfield University for their rigorous and painstaking work. I am also grateful to the participating airlines which made their flight staff and management time and their aircraft available to the project. Without this invaluable practical help, the research would not have been possible.

The Department will always take the health of persons on board aircraft very seriously and I hope the publication of this thorough and independent analysis by Cranfield University will provide reassurance on this issue. We will continue to keep in close touch on all aviation health matters with the UK's aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.

The Department will now take forward the one remaining cabin air study outstanding - the swab test research being conducted by the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh.

When that has been finished all the completed research projects will be submitted to the Committee on Toxicity for their consideration so that the public can be assured that this matter has been thoroughly investigated.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110511,Strategic Framework for Road Safety,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** Today I am launching a new [strategic framework for road safety](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/strategic-framework-for-road-safety). This outlines the Government's plans to reduce deaths and injuries on Britain's roads as well as the measures and steps that others can take. It is available for download from the Department for Transport website.

The strategic framework aims to provide clarity to local authorities, road safety professionals and other stakeholders on their roles and responsibilities in improving road safety and the increased freedom that is being given to local authorities in assessing and acting on their own priorities.

In line with the Coalition's commitment to localism, we want decisions to be made locally, wherever possible, and this document sets out how we are moving away from over-arching national road safety targets and towards a more sophisticated method of monitoring progress through a Road Safety Outcomes Framework which will help local authorities assess and prioritise their action and show the impact of central Government measures.

Additionally, at the local level, there will be an increase in the road safety information that is available to the public to help them hold their local authorities and service providers to account.

Of course, there is still an important role for national Government in delivering safer roads. Our central focus will be on supporting road users who have weak driving skills or who display a lapse of judgement to improve their driving, while focusing enforcement resources against those who deliberately decide to undertake antisocial and dangerous driving behaviour.

Where road users make low level mistakes or display poor skills we intend to divert them in to a greater range of educational courses to help develop safer skills and attitudes. We will extend this approach to careless driving through the introduction of a new fixed penalty notice as well as new remedial educational courses. We need to re-balance road safety enforcement away from a narrow focus on camera-enforced speed policing, to address the wider range of behaviours that create risk on the roads. Where road users commit serious, deliberate and repeated offences we aim to increase the effectiveness of enforcement for this minority - for example, through improving the efficiency of action on drink and drug driving. Through this approach we aim to improve the targeting and effectiveness of enforcement to tackle a wide range of unsafe behaviours that cover all careless and dangerous driving offences.

Our long-term vision is to ensure that Britain remains a world leader on road safety and to continue the downward trend in casualties.  We believe that the measures set out in this strategic framework will help us to achieve this vision.

Full impact assessments, including the potential impacts on enforcement and the judicial system, will be prepared in the usual way when legislation is brought forward.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110513,The Equality Act 2010 (Work on Ships and Hovercraft) Regulations 2011,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** I have today laid before the House draft affirmative Regulations which, if approved, will apply Part 5 (Work) of the Equality Act 2010 to work on ships and hovercraft and to seafarers.

The Regulations will ensure that, as far as possible, the level of protection afforded under Part 5 of the Equality Act 2010 is extended to those working at sea.  This was not done at the time that Part 5 of the Equality Act 2010 was commenced because further consideration needed to be given to the issue of seafarers' pay.

 As the law currently stands, section 9 of the Race Relations Act, 1976, provides that it is not unlawful for seafarers to be paid different rates of pay on the basis of their nationality if they were recruited outside Great Britain. This includes seafarers from EEA States and designated States, which are States with particular bilateral agreements with the European Union. The European Commission has been investigating a complaint that UK law does not comply with European Law and in January this year it issued a Reasoned Opinion on that basis.  In order to meet its Treaty obligations, the Government is obliged to bring UK law into line with European law.

The Regulations which I have laid before the House today will, if approved, apply Part 5 of the Equality Act to work on ships and hovercraft and to seafarers. The Government is already committed to the Equality Act 2010, most of which, including Part 5, was commenced on 1 October 2010.  The international nature of the shipping industry requires further clarity in specifying to which seafarers, working on which vessels, operating in which waters, Part 5 of the Act applies. The relevant provisions legislate in respect of employment, offering protection from discrimination, harassment and victimisation in relation to certain protected characteristics, these being age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, sex and sexual orientation.  Section 81 of the Act contains the power to achieve this by means of an affirmative statutory instrument.

The power within section 81 of the Act is also wide enough to legislate in respect of differential pay.  The Regulations will, if approved, provide that it is not unlawful to offer to pay or pay different rates of pay to seafarers (applicants, employees and contract workers), other than those from EEA or designated states, if a person applies for work as a seafarer or is recruited as a seafarer outside Great Britain.

Under section 19 of the Equality Act 2010 (indirect discrimination), where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice has an effect which particularly disadvantages seafarers from EEA or designated states in terms of a difference in pay, this will nevertheless be lawful if the employer can show that the provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified.  If differential pay were challenged by a seafarer from an EEA or designated State, it would be for the employer to satisfy an employment tribunal as to that justification.

The Government has consulted with ship owners and the Chamber of Shipping as well as the Trades Unions before proceeding with this measure and has prepared an Impact Assessment.  In preparing these Regulations, we have applied the principles of our Reducing Regulation initiative and taken every care to ensure that the Regulations meet the requirements of EU law without unwarranted elaboration, the better to safeguard the continued competitiveness of the UK fleet.  We remain committed to the Red Ensign and to maintaining a sizeable, high quality and highly competitive fleet under the UK flag.

In accordance with Government policy on transforming the role of regulation in our society and reducing regulation, these Regulations will be reviewed every five years and the conclusions of such reviews will be published.

These Regulations will apply in England, Wales and Scotland while Northern Ireland will shortly be introducing similar regulations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110516,Sale of Trust Ports,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** I am today launching a consultation on the criteria that the Government considers particularly relevant to the consideration of the appropriateness of sale of a major trust port [1] in England or Wales under the Ports Act 1991.

During the consultation period, which will run for six weeks until 27 June 2011, I am seeking the views of interested parties on the following criteria, which I propose to adopt in place of those set out in the Written Ministerial Statement on the sale of trust ports of 25 January 2010.

In view of this consultation, I have asked my Rt Hon Friend the Minister of State to suspend her consideration of the application for a transfer of the port undertaking made by Dover Harbour Board under the Ports Act 1991 until I announce a decision on the proposed criteria.

## The Proposed Criteria

The following criteria are those which the Government considers particularly relevant when considering an application under the Ports Act 1991 for the sale of a major trust port in England or Wales. This covers the consideration of any proposal for a transfer scheme submitted under section 9 or 10 of the 1991 Act, together with the exercise of the Secretary of State's functions in respect of the subsequent sale of the port to which the scheme relates.  The Secretary of State also intends to have particular regard to the policy considerations set out below before making a transfer scheme himself under section 12 of the 1991 Act or subsequently approving the sale of a port to which his scheme relates.

### Community participation

The Secretary of State will not approve an application for the sale of a trust port under the 1991 Act unless the sale is considered likely to deliver an ongoing and significant level of community participation in the port.  Such participation could take a variety of forms, but must include the ability to influence the port's long term development and may include the right to receive a share in the profits of the port, or the future increase in its value.  It does not necessarily require a community role in the operation of the port.

### Future Development of the Port

The Secretary of State will not approve an application unless the sale is considered likely to deliver an ownership model with the capability and access to capital to meet future investment needs.

### Fair price

The Secretary of State will not approve an application unless the sale is considered likely to represent good value for money, having regard not only to Exchequer proceeds and market conditions, but also to other benefits including those to the community and the wider economy.

### Fair competition

The Secretary of State will not approve an application that is likely to deliver an ownership model which results in unsatisfactory levels of competition in the relevant sector.

### Transport networks

It is highly desirable for an application to be likely to deliver an ownership model which will cause the port to be operated so as to contribute to reliable and efficient transport networks.

### Sale process

It is highly desirable that the sale should be conducted in such a way as to give all bona fide prospective purchasers a fair and equitable opportunity to participate.

### Employee involvement

It is desirable for an application to be likely to deliver port employee participation in the ownership of the port, such as the right to receive equity shares or a share in its future success. [2]

[1] For the purposes of the Act, a 'major trust port' is a trust port with an annual turnover above a certain limit (currently £7.6m). In England and Wales this currently includes Dover, Tyne, Milford Haven, Shoreham, Poole, Harwich Haven and the Port of London Authority (though the latter is excluded from provisions on privatisation contained in the Act).

[2] This is without prejudice to the Ports Act 1991 section 5(3) requirement to have particular regard to the desirability of encouraging the disposal of the whole or a substantial part of the equity share capital of the successor company to managers or other persons employed by the port company etc.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110519,Sir Roy McNulty report on rail value for money/West Coast,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** With permission Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the publication today of Sir Roy McNulty's independent study into Value for Money in the Rail Industry and also update the House about the West Coast franchise process.

Sir Roy's report notes that UK rail has enjoyed a revival in recent years, with strong and resilient growth in overall numbers of passengers and in passenger satisfaction, and huge improvements in reliability and safety.

This Government wants to see Britain's railways continue to prosper and has demonstrated by its actions its commitment to them: Despite the difficult fiscal climate, we have allocated funding to complete Crossrail and Thameslink and to support the upgrade of the London Underground; We have announced electrification on the Great Western Mainline and in the North West of England. We've resumed the Intercity Express Programme to improve reliability comfort and journey times on the East Coast and Great Western Mainlines; We've given the go-ahead to the Ordsall Chord project in Manchester and the Swindon to Kemble re-doubling; confirmed the purchase of over 2,000 new rail vehicles for Thameslink, Crossrail and for other franchises and the cascading of 100's more; and last Mr Speaker, but not least, we've begun the HS2 High Speed Rail consultation process.

But Mr Speaker, Sir Roy has also made another, less welcome finding. Spending on the passenger railway has increased by 60% in real terms since 1996/97, that's more than £4bn, and despite significant passenger growth, unit costs in 2009 were almost exactly the same in real terms as in 1996, so that UK rail is now up to 40% more expensive per passenger mile than the railways of our European competitors.  After allowing for unavoidable differences, Sir Roy estimates that UK rail costs are 20-30% higher than they should be, and that potential savings amounting to between £740m and £1.05bn a year could be found by 2018/19 without any reductions in services. These savings, when added to the savings Network Rail are already committed to achieving to 2014 and the savings Sir Roy expects the Regulator to seek from Network Rail over the period to 2019, should largely close this efficiency gap.

Many of Sir Roy's recommendations are directed to the industry, and the open and inclusive process that the study has adopted means that some of them are already being implemented: the industry has come together to form a Rail Delivery Group to provide the leadership which Sir Roy has noted as lacking in the past; and Network Rail has announced its plans to devolve significant autonomy to route managers across the network - starting with the Wessex and Scottish regions.

Sir Roy's remit, set by my predecessor and the ORR who co-sponsored the study, was narrowly focused on the cost-base of the railway. He makes a large number of recommendations and over the coming months, the Government will consider those of Sir Roy's recommendations that are directed to it and will deliver its response later this year. Many of the recommendations on franchises reflect the changes the Government has already announced and in addition I can confirm today that my Department will accept Sir Roy's recommendation that it should conduct a full review of fares policy, including addressing anomalies in the current system and the potential for much greater use of smart technology.

In parallel, the Government is developing a wider rail strategy to ensure the affordable, sustainable, safe and high quality railway, that will deliver a better deal both for taxpayers and to farepayers and set out clearly the roles of Government, - both central and local - train operators and Network Rail in securing the future of the railway.

Mr Speaker, this is urgent and vital work. Let us be in no doubt - the excessive cost base that Sir Roy has identified is the reason that UK Rail fares are already by some margin the highest in Europe, even though levels of taxpayer subsidy are also among the highest in Europe. And let's be clear about the potential prize: the successful delivery of cost reductions over the next few years on the scale set out by McNulty, would enable us to reduce levels of taxpayer subsidy and, at the same time, put the era of inflation-busting fare increases behind us.

But achieving the challenging targets for cost reduction and industry-wide efficiency gain that Sir Roy has identified will need all players in the industry to work together.  The train operators, Network Rail, Rolling Stock Companies, Unions and Government - none of them can avoid playing their part if we are to deliver a sustainable and affordable railway for the future.

In the case of my Department, Sir Roy is clear that we need to step back from excessively detailed specification of train services and micro-management of rail operations.  I recognise this will represent a major culture change - but one I am determined to deliver.

Mr Speaker, I would like to place on record my thanks to Sir Roy McNulty and his team for the excellent work they have done and to welcome Sir Roy's commitment to working with the industry on an ongoing basis.

I also wish to announce to the House today the publication of the draft Invitation to Tender and stakeholder briefing document for the Inter City West Coast franchise, which lays out the train service specification I am minded to procure for this route.

As I have said, the Government has already adopted Sir Roy's recommendation that franchise specifications should become less prescriptive. The proposed Train Service Specification for Inter City West Coast represents a relaxation from the rigid timetable specifications of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key elements of service, such as principal first and last train services and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day.  This marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has, under the current system, prevented operators from maximising capacity and reacting to the changing demands of their passengers.

Amongst other proposed changes, we intend to replace the current ""cap and collar"" revenue sharing system that has driven perverse behaviour by train operators, with a GDP-based risk-sharing arrangement and a profit-share mechanism which will ensure the taxpayer benefits from any unexpected profits over the term of the franchise.

Because relaxation of full prescription of train services in line with Sir Roy's recommendations was not signalled in the consultation document that we published on 19 January, I have decided that it is right and proper to consult on these proposals again, starting today, and ending on 17 August.  As a consequence of this decision, Mr Speaker, I can inform the House that the new franchise on the Intercity West Coast will now be awarded in August 2012, after a competitive process involving the four shortlisted train operators, and will commence operations on 9th December 2012.  In making this decision, I have deliberately avoided a change of franchise immediately ahead of or during the Olympic period and have also decided to take advantage of the short delay to complete the integration of the 106 new Pendolino carriages into the fleet prior to the commencement of the new franchise.

The Department will seek to agree acceptable terms with the existing franchisee for a contract extension to 9th December 2012, but Directly Operated Railways Ltd, the Government-owned company that runs East Coast, will be ready to operate the franchise between April and December 2012 if necessary.

Copies of the Rail Value for Money study and the draft Invitation to Tender for the West Coast Mainline have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available on the Department's website.

Our expectation is that future passenger franchises on UK rail will allow operators greater flexibility to meet passenger demand and to pursue innovation, while protecting the key elements of service for passengers.

Longer franchises and a changed relationship with Network Rail will have a positive impact on the behaviour and appetite for investment and risk taking by train operators.  But I want to send a clear message that the new culture of cooperation in the rail industry, and the focus on cost reduction, is here to stay and it is mandatory, not optional.  So I can today announce that, as a matter of policy for all future franchise competitions, a significant part of the assessment of bidders' capability at the pre-qualification stage will be evidence of success in collaborative working and driving down costs.

Mr Speaker, the facts are clear: our railway costs too much; in consequence fares are rising faster than inflation and taxpayer subsidy has reached unsustainable levels.

To secure the future of the railway, we now have to tackle this problem after a decade of ignoring it, and get costs into line with those of our European comparators, bringing relief to taxpayers and the prospect of an end to the era of above-inflation fare increases to passengers.

I commend this statement to the House.

As set out within my Department's Business Plan, the review supports this Government's vision for a transport system which is an engine for economic growth, and its commitment to tackling the causes of congestion and unreliability on the strategic road network.

Motorway closures in England costs the economy around £1 billion a year, which is an unacceptable brake on the country's economic recovery.  Tackling the causes of congestion and keeping traffic moving is a vital element in securing the UK's prosperity.

As such, we completed a review of motorway closure incidents, to identify what improvements could be made to achieve the shortest timeline possible for managing such incidents.

The review led by this Department makes ten recommendations, the delivery of which will ensure that there is overall improvement in the time taken to reopen motorways following an incident. The recommendations are contained within the report.

I am also announcing DfT funding of around £3 million for laser scanning technology that can be used by the police for surveying incident scenes.  Recent trials by the police and HA have demonstrated that this can make a real difference in speeding up the investigation process. The £3m will be used to set up a fund which police forces can bid from to put towards the purchase of this technology. The fund will take a match funding approach thereby potentially enabling a larger number of forces to purchase and use this equipment across the strategic road network and local road network.

Later today, I will be chairing a national summit with representatives from all key incident management parties to discuss the review's findings, and to formally agree the high-level action plan on the way forward.  The majority of the review's recommendations are expected to be completed by the end of the year, and we remain on track to deliver on a further business plan commitment to set up and implement measures to reduce congestion caused by incidents by December 2012.  I am confident that by having open dialogue and by continuing to work closely with the emergency services and colleagues across Government in this collaborative manner, we can manage incidents effectively, efficiently and consistently.

The strategic national corridors were established in 2009 to define the network over which the largest proportion of strategic traffic - that is traffic travelling between the ten largest urban areas, ten busiest ports and seven busiest airports in England - moves around the country. The original definition also provided for connectivity between the four nations of the United Kingdom, but there was no specific provision for connecting capital cities.

We concluded that the routes linking Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to the nearest urban strategic destination should be recognised for the strategic connectivity that they provide, and consulted accordingly. After taking account of the consultation responses I can now confirm that we are going ahead with this change.

Specifically, we identified two routes as having national significance: namely the A1 between its junction with the A19 north of Newcastle and the Scottish Border, providing a defined link to Edinburgh; and a route between Bootle and the Twelve Quays Ferry Terminal in Birkenhead, providing connectivity with Belfast. Again, after taking account of the consultation responses, I can confirm that these routes will henceforth become roads of national significance.

A number of other suggestions were made for changes to the SNCs, including specific proposals for increases in coverage. My Department will reconsider the scope and role of the SNCs once the LEPs are well established and their role in transport decision-making is clear.

The consultation documents, including the consultation response, can be found on my Department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House library.

As part of this, I am today announcing, with the agreement of my Right Honourable Friend the Home Secretary, that the security of the railways and London Underground will be further enhanced by the development of a British Transport Police (BTP) armed capability that will be deployed as appropriate in response to the terrorism threat level at any given time.

The Government has been considering the resilience of the overall police armed capability and has concluded that it would be beneficial to enhance this by providing the BTP with an armed capability of its own. The timing of this is not as a result of any specific threat: it is a sensible and pragmatic approach to ensuring that our police forces have the right resources to be able to respond as and when needed to protect the public.

By sanctioning the development of this armed capability, we will reduce the burden on other police forces which currently provide armed support to the BTP. This is not a major new capability in terms of overall armed policing, but by training BTP officers to carry out armed patrolling of the rail network it equips BTP with a capability already available to other police forces. Armed patrols will be deployed according to operational need - it will not be a daily event to see armed officers at stations.

We will continue to work with the BTP and others to assess the use of this capability and its effectiveness and impact. I would like to reassure Parliament that this is a measured and proportionate approach to supporting the BTP in maintaining public safety on the railway.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110607,Public Bodies Bill - Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC),"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** The cross-Government review of Non-Departmental Public Bodies, responding to this House in October 2010, decided that the public bodies landscape needed radical reform to increase accountability, cut out duplication of activity, increase transparency and discontinue activities that were no longer needed. Amongst the recommendations was that DPTAC be abolished.

The Public Bodies Bill is currently before Parliament. The Bill as drafted, would allow the Government to make an Order abolishing DPTAC. If the Bill is passed with this provision in it, I am minded to make such an Order. But before coming to a definite decision to do so, I intend to consult on the Order and will make no final decision until I have taken into account the responses to that consultation.

In advance of this formal consultation I am inviting views from all those with an interest on what successor arrangements should be put in place if DPTAC is abolished. I am seeking to ensure that any successor arrangement will continue to provide my Department with consensual, pan-disability advice in a flexible way, and that any arrangement represents value for money.

I propose to invite comments on the options listed below:

  * Option 1: Rely on existing expertise in the Department for Transport policy divisions and agencies. Where ad-hoc specific advice is needed, it could be sought by individual policy divisions from third party stakeholder groups, the transport industry, and experts. This would have minimal cost (although commissioned, consultancy advice could be expensive) but perhaps risks disability issues being overlooked.
  * Option 2: Establish a stakeholder forum, which could be convened and provide advice as and when issues arose. Again this would have minimal cost, but could again result in an increased consultancy bill. It might also be difficult to decide who to appoint to the forum. There are over 50 disability groups, and their interests sometimes conflict (e.g. the interests of the visually impaired, and those using mobility scooters). Achieving consensus could therefore be difficult.
  * Option 3: Rely on a cross-government body to provide transport advice - for example the existing (non statutory) Equality 2025, run by the Department of Work and Pensions. This option should ensure that disability issues do not get overlooked. Equality 2025 is likely to be able to offer general advice - for example on transport access to the Olympics by disabled people - but would not be in a position to offer more specialist advice, for example the type of mobility scooter models suitable to be carried on public transport.
  * Option 4: Establish a non-statutory specialist body which would be flexible and accountable to Ministers. This may cost more than the options above, but should be less expensive than the current arrangements. However, a smaller body because of its size, may not cover all disability areas, and therefore could reduce the opportunities to provide pan-disability advice.
  * Option 5: A wide ranging panel of experts from which members could be drawn, on an ad hoc basis, when specific advice is needed. A once a year meeting of all specified stakeholders could be held so that they all have the opportunity of voicing wider concerns.

My initial thinking is that option 5 would be the most appropriate path to take, but I would welcome views to inform my decision making in this area.

As I explained in my Written Ministerial Statement on 30 March, amending Regulations have been drafted, and work is in train to ensure that these amending Regulations take account of representations made - including representations arising from an extension, over the period 9 February to 10 March 2011, of the review of the _Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010_ for the benefit of Suffolk residents and bodies.

The conclusion which I drew from the main review which was carried out in July-September 2010 was that the provisions prohibiting all ship-to-ship transfers outside harbour authority areas will be replaced by provisions restricting ship-to-ship transfers outside harbour authority areas to a single designated area within the UK Territorial Sea and establishing a system of permits issued by the MCA, giving effect at the same time to the new chapter 8 of Annex I to the MARPOL Convention.

Having taken account of all the representations made, both in the main review and in the extension of the review in February and March, I have again come to the conclusion that this is the appropriate course of action and that the designated area for ship-to-ship transfers (other than in harbour authority waters) shall be the waters off the Suffolk coast where ship-to-ship transfers are already carried out.

The recognition of these waters off the Suffolk coast as a suitable area for carrying out ship-to-ship transfers is based on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's and the industry's actual experience of the successful use of these waters for ship-to-ship transfer operations over a number of years without pollution of the seas and coasts. The MCA will continue to monitor such operations closely to ensure they are carried out to the highest possible safety standards.

I shall place an addition to the analytical table previously provided in December 2010, which summarises the points of substance made in the written representations and the meetings held with interested parties during the period of the extension of the review in February and March, in the libraries of both Houses and on the Department's website.

As I also indicated in my Written Ministerial Statement on 30 March, the amended _Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 _are intended to come into force on 1 October 2011. In common with other new domestic secondary legislation, these Regulations will contain provisions setting an automatic expiry date and requiring them to be reviewed in a specified number of years.

It was announced in the Budget (March 2011) that the Government ""intends to realise value from its shareholding in NATS, subject to considering the views of key interested parties"". This commitment reflects the Government's policy that assets held in the public sector where there is no policy requirement to do so tie up state resources that could deliver better value for money for the public if used elsewhere. We are seeking evidence through this process from key interested parties including the regulator, employees of NATS and the wider aviation industry, to establish whether or not there is a policy requirement to retain a shareholding in NATS.

NATS provides strategically important services to the UK and as such, I want to ensure that the overall aviation policy objectives of safety, security, economic regulation, civil/military cooperation, environment and supporting the Single European Sky programme are not compromised by any decisions we take over future share ownership. The call for evidence document outlines the controls and protections that exist in NATS' operating environment independent of the Government's shareholding and seeks evidence from consultees on what, if any, protections would be required on top of these to allow the delivery of these objectives.

The call for evidence will be open from today until 6th July and we aim to publish the results shortly after the closing date. The evidence collected will support my final decision about whether to sell Government shares in NATS.

The Council will be asked to reach a General Approach on a Directive which recasts the 2001 First Rail Package. The 2001 legislation set the initial framework for a single European rail market. The proposal aims to address the fact that the First Railway Package has not achieved its declared objective of market opening through a number of proposals to improve the transparency of rail market access conditions and access to rail-related services.

Although we support the Commission's overall aim of clarifying and strengthening the regulatory framework for rail access and recognise the need for some further liberalisation in continental Europe, we have concerns about the investment disincentives and the cost impacts of some of the proposals on the UK. We have negotiated changes which align the text more closely with the arrangements which prevail in the UK, whilst preserving the proposals for liberalisation in continental Europe.

However, there is little in the package which gives the UK any added value over the existing First Railway Package directive.

The Council will also be asked to reach a General Approach on the draft amending regulation 1406/2002, which established the European Maritime Safety Agency. The proposed amendment, while maintaining the Agency's present objectives, gives it several new, largely technical, tasks. While we recognise the importance of the additional tasks, we are opposed to any increase in the budget, unless it is financed through reprioritisation of funds from other areas of the EU Budget.

There will be a policy debate on the European Commission's recent White Paper, ""Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area - Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system"". The broad thrust of the White Paper is in line with the UK's goal of a transport system that supports economic growth whilst delivering CO2 reductions. The Council debate will centre on a number of questions put by the Presidency. Our position includes a clear request to the Commission that detailed initiatives arising from this general policy framework are feasible and realistic, avoid excessive regulatory burdens on business, and respect the principle of subsidiarity.

The Council will be asked to adopt Conclusions on a recent Commission Communication, ""The way ahead towards integrated and competitive EU inland waterway transport"". The Conclusions are acceptable to the UK.

The Council will be asked to adopt a decision on the signing and conclusion of an agreement with the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail on the EU accession to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) of 9 May 1980, as amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3 June 1999. The UK can support adoption of the decision. The Council will be asked to adopt two decisions in the area of aviation external relations.

The first is a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Moldova on a comprehensive air transport agreement.A comprehensive air transport agreement will result in the integration of the Moldovan aviation market into the single European market through the convergence of EU aviation regulations, technical assistance and market opening. I will support the decision authorising the opening of negotiations.

The second decision is on the signature of an air transport agreement which has been negotiated with Brazil. This agreement will significantly liberalise the market in air services between the EU and Brazil, providing new opportunities for the aviation industry. I will support the decision and sign the agreement.

Among AOB items, the Commission will be reporting on progress in work on air cargo security. As I did at the March Council, I will reiterate the importance of moving forward quickly with this work.

Also under AOB, the Commission will report on the follow-up to the volcanic ash crisis of 2010, looking at the wider scope of crisis management and EU methodology and on recent developments in implementing the Single European Sky.

The penalty relates to four breaches of the terms of the company's franchise agreement which occurred before management of Chiltern transferred to Arriva UK Trains in early 2011. These involved late delivery of two station improvements, and two timetable changes which were not properly authorised by the Department for Transport and which could, if unrectified, have significantly reduced the value of the franchise to the Department. These breaches were in the context of the company's poor performance in meeting a number of its detailed contractual obligations over a substantial period.

The Department imposes such penalties very rarely. When it does so, the aim is to encourage train operators to comply with their contractual obligations to the Department under franchise agreements. It should be emphasised that the penalty does not relate to Chiltern's operational performance. As a number of consultees commented, the company is noted for its high standard of performance and customer satisfaction, and for the substantial investment it is making in improving services.

The penalty has been reduced from the proposed level of £500,000 in the light of the responses to the consultation, and in particular the welcome and clear assurances from Chiltern that it has stepped up its commitment and oversight at senior management level to ensure compliance with the terms of its franchise.

The receipts from the penalty will be retained by the Department and reinvested in transport. No decision has been made at this stage as to the final use of the funds.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110616,Thameslink rolling stock,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** The Department for Transport is today announcing the identity of the preferred bidder for the new fleet of trains required for the Thameslink Programme. This represents a significant milestone in the delivery of this crucial rail upgrade project.

The £6 billion Thameslink Programme includes major improvements to central London stations such as Blackfriars, Farringdon and London Bridge and will generate significant benefits for passengers. It will make travelling across London and the south east faster, easier and more reliable and will reduce crowding on some of the busiest sections of London's transport network. It will see the introduction of a new generation of electric commuter trains operating with metro-style frequency at up to 24 trains per hour through the central section during the morning and evening peaks.

This new fleet of trains comprises some 1,200 carriages. By the end of 2018, this will almost double the capacity of Thameslink's core central London section in the peak periods. It is a major part of the Government's commitment to introduce an additional 2,100 carriages on to the rail network by 2019, as announced in November of last year.  The new Thameslink fleet is expected to release existing carriages for use elsewhere on the network, particularly as further routes are electrified, for example in the north west of England and the Thames Valley commuter lines.

The competition to supply trains and maintenance services for the Thameslink programme was designed and launched under the previous administration in 2008, in accordance with EU procurement procedures. In October 2009 the previous government announced that the two remaining short-listed bidders were Siemens Plc with Cross London Trains (XLT) and Bombardier Transportation UK Ltd with VeloCity. Since then, a great deal of work has been undertaken by the Department with both bidders to refine proposals and to secure best and final bids.

Following the completion of the process, I can announce today that the preferred bidder for the supply of the new Thameslink trains will be Siemens Plc with Cross London Trains (XLT) - a special purpose company comprising of Siemens Project Ventures GmbH, Innisfree Ltd and 3i Infrastructure Plc.

The Siemens-led venture will deliver the first new train on to the network by the start of 2015, with the order complete by the middle of 2017. The new trains will offer a step change in passenger experience, with greater passenger carrying capacity, improved passenger communication and easier access for passengers with specific mobility needs. They will also deliver high levels of reliability with the owner and manufacturer of the trains liable for financial penalties if the trains do not perform.

The choice of Siemens Plc with Cross London Trains (XLT) as preferred bidder represents the best value for money for taxpayers. Siemens is today confirming that this announcement will create up to 2,000 new jobs in their UK operations and across the UK supply chain in train component manufacturing, with a particular focus in the North East of England, and in the construction of the depots and subsequent maintenance of the new fleet of trains.

These jobs are additional to those created by the Thameslink infrastructure works which are currently underway. At the peak of construction activity - during the reconstruction of London Bridge Station from 2013 to 2018 - we expect around 3,000 people to be directly employed on the Thameslink infrastructure works as a whole, with as many again employed in related jobs in the wider community.  Taking account of other investments in rail announced by this Government, including Crossrail and the Inter City Express Programme, the total peak construction employment rises to around 17,000 people.

In order to maintain momentum on the Thameslink Programme, it is important that discussions with Siemens Plc and Cross London Trains move forward quickly to enable financial close to occur as soon as practicable. That is, of course, subject to the Government being satisfied that the proposal continues to offer value for money as the commercial discussions are concluded.

The alternative bidder, Bombardier Transportation UK Ltd with VeloCity - a special purpose company comprising Bombardier Transportation (Holdings) UK Ltd, RREEF Ltd, Serco Holdings Ltd, Amber Infrastructure Group Ltd and SMBC Leasing (UK) Ltd - also presented an attractive proposal and it is our intention to retain them as the reserve bidder.
This announcement of the preferred bidder for these new trains marks further progress in the delivery of the Thameslink Programme, and reinforces the Government's commitment to upgrading the capacity, quality and reliability of our transport infrastructure and ensuring high value for money for the taxpayer in delivering major rail projects.

In this difficult economic period, the Government has decided that it is right to review the continuing requirement for Government support for training and skills development in this sector and how best to spend any continuing Government funding.

In my Written Ministerial Statement of 8 December 2010 [_Official Report_, cols 24-26WS] I announced my intention to commission a review and I can confirm that today I have launched an invitation to tender. The successful bidder will present its findings to an independent panel, which will report to me by the end of the year and make practical recommendations on how the economic requirement for trained seafarers in the UK can be best met, having regard to current financial constraints.

The terms of reference for the review are as follows:

  * to review the UK requirement for trained seafarers at sea over the next decade;
  * to review the UK requirement for trained seafarers ashore over the next decade;
  * to examine the extent to which the above requirements have to be met by UK seafarers;
  * to review the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing funding arrangements and the future need for Government intervention to ensure the supply of trained seafarers;
  * to identify options for supporting the training of seafarers and make recommendations which address the issue of value for money and are reflective of future UK requirements for trained seafarers;
  * to examine whether previous training targets are reflective of future needs.

The consultation identified strong support from the haulage industry for the development of truckstops.  Proposals for dedicated truckstop facilities will now be considered in the context of existing and/or proposed rest facilities on the strategic road network, and will be determined on their individual merit.  This will include truckstop facilities that can be accessed direct from motorways - Motorway Truckstops - which are a type of facility not permitted until now. Where there is evidence to demonstrate that demand for lorry parking exceeds supply, the development of truckstop facilities at existing service areas would be viewed favourably. Proposals for Motorway Truckstops are unlikely to be supported if they would prevent a potential motorway service area (MSA) being built.

Detailed advice on the mandatory and permitted features of all categories of truckstop is set out in the table that is attached at Appendix 1 to the written copy of my Statement.

These changes supplement DfT Circular 01/2008 (April 2008).  Aspects of policy not touched on in this Statement will continue to apply.****

I am currently considering ways to reduce regulation, increase competition and improve still further the quality of motorway service areas. To this end, I have instructed officials in my department to identify those elements of the policy that might instead be better determined at a local level through the current planning system.

I have also instructed my officials to work with the Department for Communities and Local Government to consider how best to take these issues forward in the context of the National Planning Policy Framework. Separately, we will produce an associated DfT technical note, setting out requirements in respect of road safety and operational issues.

This approach accords with the Government's twin aims of decentralisation and localism, reducing the burden of bureaucracy and strengthening local accountability.  It will encourage competition and, through this, improve service for users.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20110623,Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) reform consultation,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Theresa Villiers)**: I am pleased to announce that a consultation on reforming the air travel organisers' licensing (ATOL) scheme is being published today.

Since its inception some 40 years ago, the ATOL scheme has successfully protected many millions of consumers on flight-inclusive package holidays  against the insolvency of their travel company.  However, the travel trade and holiday market has seen significant change and diversification in recent years. There are now many holidays available which look like packages but do not fall under the legal definition and so are not protected under the ATOL scheme.

There is a strong case for reforming the scheme to better reflect today's holiday market so that consumers can be clear when their holiday is protected, allowing them to understand and use their legal rights. In addition, the scheme has operated with a deficit for some years and is supported by taxpayers through a Government guarantee. The reforms should put the ATOL scheme on the path to financial self-sustainability, with a view to ending the need for taxpayer support.

The consultation document sets out the details of the 'in principle' decisions I announced on 3 February (_Official Report_ 3 Feb 2011: Column 55WS). These were:

  * extending the ATOL scheme to Flight-Plus holidays comprising a flight and other component bought within two successive days;
  * that everyone booking a ATOL protected package holiday or Flight-Plus will get a recognisable 'ATOL certificate' confirming their rights under the scheme for refunds and repatriation should their travel company fail;
  * helping ensure that 'agent for the consumer' businesses arranging holidays are fully aware of their legal responsibilities to consumers.

It contains the draft secondary legislation needed to implement the first two measures.

This is an important first step towards reforming the ATOL scheme. These reforms will address a major area of uncertainty for consumers when buying holidays from tour operators and travel agents.  The additional ATOL Protection Contributions at £2.50 per booking should help the scheme become financially self-sustaining within three years.

Importantly, the reforms pave the way for further potential change to the ATOL scheme in the medium to longer term.  Once the scheme's deficit has been paid off and the guarantee withdrawn, there is an opportunity to consider how funding repatriations and refunds might best be arranged in today's market.  The consultation seeks initial views on this, to inform more detailed work to be undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority later in the year and into 2012.

The consultation also asks stakeholders about bringing holiday sales by airlines and those arranged on an 'agent for the consumer' basis into the scheme.  These would require new primary legislation.  The Bill to reform airport economic regulation could provide a vehicle to make the necessary changes if Government decides to go ahead with these further reforms.  Decisions on reforms needing new primary legislation are planned for the autumn and may also need to take account work underway by the European Commission on the future of the Package Travel Directive.

The consultation closes on 15 September 2011. My aim is to announce decisions in the autumn on the way forward on the reforms dependent on new secondary legislation.  Subject to consultation responses, the intention is for the reforms to come into effect on 1 January 2012, so consumers have the benefit of the additional protection from their summer 2012 holidays.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110623,EU Transport Council,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** I attended the second Transport Council of the Hungarian Presidency in Luxembourg on 16 June.

The Council reached a General Approach on a Directive which **recasts the 2001 first rail package**. The 2001 legislation set the initial framework for a single European rail market, setting out principles for charging and access to the network. The present draft Directive modifies the three 2001 Directives. The Presidency tabled a compromise text which was slightly amended at the Council. The Presidency then concluded that there was a qualified majority for a General Approach. The text of the General Approach is acceptable to the UK.

The Council also reached a general Approach on the draft Regulation amending Regulation 1406/2002, which established the **European Maritime Safety Agency**. This amending Regulation modifies and extends the tasks of the Agency to bring them in line with recent international and EU developments in the maritime safety field. I set out the UK's opposition to any staff or administrative cost increases for the Agency, and was able to accept revised wording on Agency resources, which addressed our concerns.

The Council debated the **European Commission's recent White Paper**, ""Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area - Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system"", which was issued in March. The Council debate centred on a number of questions put by the Presidency.

The White Paper aims to increase the sustainability and competitiveness of the sector while moving towards a fully integrated transport network. In doing so, the Commission aims to cut carbon emissions from transport by 60% by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels). Member States broadly agreed that the transport sector has to make an adequate contribution to the achievement of the medium and long-term climate change targets. I explained that, while supporting the broad thrust of the ten goals in the White Paper, the UK has some concerns on the detail.

We are not in favour of having targets for their own sake, and do not think that it is practical or desirable to have a multiplicity of goals and targets. Furthermore, we do not support sector specific targets, which would constrain our progress on carbon reduction within the economy as a whole. Wherever targets are set, we believe that they must be realistic and supported by robust evidence and cost impact analysis. I also joined others in proposing that we work internationally to negotiate similar commitments with all of the global partners, in the framework of international organisations.

I stressed that the EU should focus on actions that need to be undertaken at EU level, and where there was no such case, it should be left to Member States and local authorities to act.  I also welcomed, with support from some other Ministers, the Commission's commitment to undertake thorough impact assessments for any actions.  I urged the Commission to consider the importance of reducing the overall burden of regulation, to help our businesses and the budgetary constraints that we all face, as it takes forward the White Paper proposals.

Council Conclusions were adopted on EU **inland waterway transport**, inviting the Commission to launch a project to continue support for an existing inland waterway programme, which is designed to encourage modal shift of freight from road to inland waterways, and to bring forward proposals for a follow-on programme. The Conclusions are acceptable to the UK.

The Council adopted a Decision on the signing and conclusion of an agreement with the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail on the EU accession to the **Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail** (COTIF) of 9 May 1980, as amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3 June 1999. The Decision is acceptable to the UK.

The Council adopted two Decisions in the area of **aviation external relations**, both of which were acceptable to the UK.

The first Decision authorised the Commission to open negotiations with **Moldova** on a comprehensive air transport agreement.

The second was a Decision on the signature of an air transport agreement between the EU and **Brazil**. Ministers pre-signed the agreement in the margins of the Council.

Among AOB items, the Commission reported on **air cargo security** work which has been carried out in pursuit of the Action Plan endorsed by Ministers at the December 2010  JHA and Transport Councils.  They were disappointed that a proposal to strengthen EU inbound air cargo security had been narrowly defeated in the June Regulatory Committee, and called on Ministers from Member States which voted against or abstained to rethink their position,   I joined Germany in expressing strong support for the Commission, and called for work to continue on the proposal.

Also under AOB, the Commission reported on work to deal with the impact of **volcanic ash** on the EU aviation sector and on recent developments in implementing the **Single European Sky**. On volcanic ash, I underlined the importance of developing the existing methodology and modelling, and increasing pressure on equipment manufacturers for engine tolerance levels.

In the margins of the Council, I met Ministers from France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands to discuss the work on volcanic ash. In a separate discussion, I exchanged views on **better regulation** with the Netherlands Minister.

The UK abstained on one item on the A point list, namely the adoption of a Council Decision on the conclusion of a Memorandum of Cooperation between the EU and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). This reflects our general need to be vigilant regarding the balance between Member States' and EU competence in UN bodies and other international organisations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110630,Charges at the Dartford-Thurrock river crossing,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning): ** I am publishing today, a consultation paper on proposals to change the charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing. The proposals concern new possible charging rates according to type of vehicle using the Crossing.

The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing is a key part of the strategic road network. It consists of two two-lane tunnels carrying traffic to the north, and a four-lane cable stayed bridge (the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge) carrying traffic to the south. The Crossing spans the River Thames between Dartford and Thurrock, forming a trunk road link (the A282 Trunk Road) in the M25 orbital motorway.

A road user charge has been collected at the Crossing since 2003, using the powers in the Transport Act 2000, in order to manage the high demand for use of the Crossing. The Department for Transport (DfT) revised the charging regime in 2008 following public consultation. Details of the current charging regime are set out in the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Charging Scheme) Order 2008 (Statutory Instrument No. 1951).

In recognition of the strategic importance of the Crossing the Government is committed to tackling the current and forecast performance issues affecting the Crossing. As part of the spending review, the Department announced that, subject to consultation, prices would increase from £1.50 to £2.00 in 2011 for cars, rising to £2.50 in 2012 and that prices for other vehicles would also increase. The proposal to increase the charges at the Crossing is both a measure to manage demand and to help to fund transport investment. For this reason I am today launching a consultation on proposals to change the charges.

The consultation makes reference to, but does not include detailed proposals for, other short, medium and long term measures to be taken forward in this spending review period in relation to the Crossing. In the short term we are announcing an initial six month trial of a protocol for suspension of the charges during periods when the severity of congestion is such as to constitute an emergency, and charge suspension would help to ease that congestion.

In the medium term our objectives are, the introduction of a free flow charging scheme and a review of options for additional crossing capacity.

I am pleased to announce that the consultation will run until 23rd September 2011. Everybody with an interest is invited to take part. A consultation document and instructions for responding can be found on my Department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House library. A public notice marking the publication of these proposals will be posted in the _London Gazette_ and the _Dartford Messenger_ on the 30th June and in the _Thurrock Gazette_ on the 1st July and copies of all the documents will be made available for public inspection at the offices of Dartford Borough Council and Thurrock Council.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-2011070,Temporary coordination of airports for the 2012 London Olympic Games,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** As part of the Government's strategy to ensure successful delivery of efficient transport services for the 2012 London Olympic Games, I am today announcing the introduction of new measures to limit disruption and delay to all flights using airports in the south east of England during the expected period of peak demand for air services for the Games.

The Airports Slot Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2011, laid before Parliament today, will come into force on the 1st August 2011. They will temporarily amend the existing regulations so as to provide new powers to ensure that during the Games period the available air space capacity over the south east of England will be able to accommodate the maximum possible number of extra flights, whilst minimising the risk of disruption or delay to existing services. These regulations will cease to have effect on the 31st December 2012.

In conjunction with the new regulations, and following two rounds of consultation, on the 1st August 2011 the Secretary of State for Transport will designate the airports listed below as temporarily coordinated until the 15th August 2012, but only in respect of slot allocation during the period of 21st July 2012 to 15th August 2012 inclusive. This period corresponds to the anticipated peak demand for air services for the Games.

In the south east of England, Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and London City are already coordinated airports. Airports that will additionally be coordinated for the Olympics period are: Birmingham Airport, Blackbushe Airport, Bournemouth Airport, Cambridge Airport, Chalgrove Airport, Coventry Airport, Cranfield Airport, Damyns Hall Aerodrome, Denham Aerodrome, Dunsfold Aerodrome, Duxford Airport, Elstree Airport, Fairoaks Airport, Farnborough Airport, Goodwood Aerodrome, Lee-on-Solent Airport, Leicester Airport, London Biggin Hill Airport, London Luton Airport, London Oxford Airport, London Southend Airport, Lydd (London Ashford Airport), Manston Airport, North Weald Airfield, Old Sarum Airfield, Peterborough Conington Airfield, RAF Northolt, Redhill Aerodrome, Rochester Airport, Shoreham Airport, Southampton Airport, Stapleford Airport, Sywell Aerodrome, Thruxton Airport, White Waltham Airfield, Wycombe Air Park.

During this period all flights operating in controlled airspace and intending to use a coordinated airport will need to obtain, and operate in accordance with, pre-booked take-off or landing slots. Slots will be allocated by Airport Coordination Ltd, the existing UK slot coordinator, in accordance with the relevant EU Regulation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110705,Local Sustainable Transport Fund,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am pleased to announce that the Department is today awarding £155.5m to support authorities in delivering local economic growth whilst cutting carbon emissions from transport.

The Department has received 73 bids to Tranche One of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from 66 lead authorities. All bids were for small projects requiring less than £5m funding from DfT. 12 bids were submitted as ""key components"" to large projects.

Proposals were assessed against the criteria as published in the [Guidance on the Application Process](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process), which was published on 19th January. Successful proposals were those judged to perform well against the twin objectives of supporting the local economy and facilitating economic development, and of reducing carbon emissions.

If proposals met these initial criteria, they were also scored on their potential to deliver wider social and economic benefits, to improve safety, to bring about improvements to air quality, or to promote increased levels of physical activity.

Proposals were required to demonstrate financial sustainability with benefits enduring beyond the life of the Fund, to incorporate a credible delivery plan, and to include a commitment to make a local contribution towards the overall costs.

In line with the published guidance, an assessment of value for money was undertaken. The Department is confident that the overall package of proposals approved in this first round represents high value for money.

I have decided to fund 39 proposals in this round. 34 proposals will be funded in full and a further 5 proposals will be funded in part. 13 proposals are considered to have potential when scored against the fund criteria, but in my view require further work.

Their promoters will be invited to improve their offer and resubmit to the Department in February 2012, or to improve their offer in the context of their large project proposal, where this proposal is shortlisted. The full list of decisions is attached.

By the deadline of 6th June, the Department received 19 expressions of interest for larger projects (requesting between £5m and £50m funding from DfT). I intend to announce at the end of July the shortlist of those authorities invited to prepare a detailed business case for their proposal. Detailed business cases will be submitted to the Department by December 2011. The Department has received 41 expressions of interest for Tranche Two small project funding, for submission by February 2012. I intend to announce successful projects in this second round in the early Summer of 2012.

I am very pleased that all eligible local authorities across England (with the exception of the Isles of Scilly) have now applied for funding to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, either as a lead bidder, or as a partner authority to a large project. The Fund has been well received by local government and I am confident that it will be effective in addressing the two key objectives of supporting growth and cutting carbon.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110707,City of Liverpool cruise terminal,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department for Transport is today launching a consultation on the proposal to remove its objection to lifting a grant condition which precludes the use of the City of Liverpool Cruise Terminal for 'turnaround' operations - that is, the beginning and/or end of a cruise voyage.

This condition, which limits use of the terminal to port-of-call visits only, was originally imposed on the grant for the Terminal, which opened in 2007, by the North West Development Agency because of concerns expressed by the Department about potentially unfair competition with other cruise terminals which have not received such public subsidy.

The Peel Ports terminal at Langton Dock in Liverpool may currently be used for turnaround operations, but it is argued that it is an unattractive prospect - both aesthetically and operationally - and has already lost traffic as a result.

Liverpool City Council is proposing to make a partial repayment of the grant, staged over 15 years, amounting to approximately £5.3 million, in return for lifting the turnaround prohibition. This amount is abated from the original grant funding to take account of the time that the Terminal will have operated with the restriction, and the fact that port-of-call visits will continue to deliver the benefits for which the grant was originally made.

It will be for Liverpool City Council to satisfy the European Commission, if necessary, that having regard to the continuing regional benefits from overall operations at the Terminal, no parallel repayment of European funding is required.

I consider that the repayment proposal by Liverpool City Council can be justified taking into account the prospective regeneration and other benefits to the Merseyside area and, on this basis, I am consulting on the possibility of removing the objection. I am inviting comments by 15 September and will then consider responses carefully before arriving at a final decision.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-2011071,The Olympic Route Network Designation (Amendment) Order 2011,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** The Olympic Route Network Designation (Amendment) Order 2011 has today been laid before Parliament.  The Order comes into force on 8 August.

This Order, made by the Olympic Delivery Authority following a three month public consultation, makes a number of changes to the roads originally designated in a June 2009 Order as forming the Olympic Route Network (ORN).  The ORN is a set of roads that will be used during the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games to provide safe and reliable transport for athletes, officials, the media and marketing partners (together the 'Games Family') between sporting and non-sporting venues.

The amendments set out in the Order comprise both additions to and removals from the designated roads, and add a net 1.3% to the length of the ORN. The changes reflect the work carried out by the ODA and its delivery partners since the initial designation on the plans for implementing the ORN and for the Games more widely - particularly on the movement of vehicles carrying members of the Games Family on the approaches to the competition venues.  The changes aim to secure more effectively safe and reliable transport for the Games Family and reduce the impacts of ORN operations on normal business.  They reflect ODA's careful consideration of the 43 responses received to the consultation exercise on proposed changes carried out last year.

Staging the Games presents a significant challenge to our transport systems.  The ORN remains a key part of our plans to ensure successful transport at the Games, for those participating, for spectators, and for those going about their normal business.  We remain committed to implementing temporary, tailored and proportionate measures on the ORN that meet the Games' needs while minimising the impacts on others.  Extensive local engagement by the ODA and Transport for London on the detailed plans for implementing the ORN, taking account of the changes set out in this Order, is now underway.

A full report on the ODA's consultation exercise and maps showing the revised ORN will be available on the ODA's website at [www.london2012.com/orn](http://www.london2012.com/orn).  The ODA will also be writing to all respondents to the consultation exercise to inform them that the Order has been laid.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110711,Search and Rescue Interim Contract,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** On 8 February I informed the House that, owing to irregularities in the bidding process, the Government had concluded that it was not appropriate to proceed with the previously planned joint MOD/DfT PFI procurement for future search and rescue capability.

The investigation into the circumstances that led to the cancellation of that procurement is ongoing. Work is also underway to identify the optimum procurement options for the long term provision of search and rescue helicopter capability for the UK.  However, as the existing Maritime and Coastguard Agency search and rescue helicopter contract that provides service at Portland, Lee on Solent, Shetland and the Isle of Lewis is set to expire, I wish to inform the House of my plans to ensure that search and rescue helicopter services from these locations continue uninterrupted until new long term arrangements are in place.

To ensure the continuity of services from these locations, the Department for Transport will shortly run a competition to procure an interim service for a period of up to five years. This contract will be similar to the arrangements that are currently in place for these bases and are working well. The contract will be open to all interested bidders able to offer a service that fully meets our requirements and ensures the safety of the public and seafarers.

These arrangements will ensure that search and rescue helicopter services are maintained while the range of options in relation to the long term future provision of such services are being fully considered. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy will continue to provide coverage from their search and rescue bases as at present, while I consider the options for the long term provision of search and rescue helicopter capability.

I will inform the House later in the year of the Government's intentions for the longer term. The procurement strategy we adopt for the longer term will seek to ensure that the Ministry of Defence is able to complete its previously announced intention to withdraw its Sea Kings from service in 2016.

As part of the Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2010, the Coalition Government confirmed their commitment to the full Crossrail scheme. A re-phased programme of delivery means that Crossrail services will commence from 2018. We expect Crossrail to cost no more than £14.5bn. Forecasts continue to suggest that Crossrail will be delivered within its existing funding.

Crossrail has made significant progress since the last annual update to Parliament. Crossrail Limited has now let all of its key tunnelling contracts and enabling works are continuing at a number of sites across central London. Construction is well advanced at Canary Wharf Crossrail Station, and tunnel boring machines are expected to be launched in spring 2012. In April 2011, Crossrail passed through the final Project Review Point, at which point the Department and TfL delegated full contractual authority to Crossrail Limited to deliver the scheme. The new Chief Executive of Crossrail Limited, Andrew Wolstenholme, was appointed in May 2011.

During the passage of the Crossrail Act through Parliament, a commitment was given that a statement would be published at least every 12 months until the completion of the construction of Crossrail, setting out information about the project's funding and finances.

In line with this commitment, this statement comes within 12 months of my last one which was published on 15th July 2010. The relevant information is as follows:

Total funding amounts provided to Crossrail Limited by the Department for Transport and TfL in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period (22nd July 2008 to 29th May 2011)  (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases)

The Taskforce was given a challenging remit. It had 12 months to identify operational improvements that could enhance the performance of these airports and bring benefits to passengers. The report is the culmination of a year long programme of work across seven areas, including punctuality, security and border controls. It sets out the issues considered by the Taskforce and its conclusions.

I would draw particular attention to the chapter on improving punctuality, tackling delay and strengthening resilience. The focus of this chapter is on Heathrow, which is the UK's biggest, busiest and most capacity constrained airport.  The main recommendation is that the scope for establishing a set of operational freedoms at Heathrow should be explored. These would enable the greater use of tactical measures in defined and limited circumstances to prevent or mitigate disruption and to facilitate recovery. These measures are consistent with our commitment to runway alternation at the airport and there would be no increase in the number of flights at the airport which will remain capped at current levels.

Tactical measures, such as operating twin arrivals streams for limited periods to tackle inbound delays, are already used at Heathrow; implementation of these proposals would mean greater use of such measures on days when the airport faced particular disruption. The Taskforce has concluded that such an approach would deliver benefits, particularly in improving reliability, but would also mean some limited redistribution of noise when measures were applied.

The work carried out so far indicates that the proposals could result in net environmental benefits, for example through reducing stacking and cutting the number of unscheduled flights during the night period. However, on the limited occasions where these freedoms would operate, some communities would be likely to experience aircraft noise during current respite periods; hence the need for safeguards to ensure they are deployed only to anticipate, prevent and mitigate disruption and to facilitate recovery.

Before any commitment is made to implementing such operational freedoms, better evidence is needed of the potential benefits and impacts.  I am therefore announcing a phased trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow. The trial will provide firm evidence on the benefits and impacts of these measures and will provide a basis for consultation with local communities before a decision is taken on whether the proposed additional operational freedoms should be adopted on a permanent basis and what safeguards should apply in relation to their use.

The trial will be in two phases to enable evidence to be gathered for both winter and summer operations. Following engagement with local communities, the first phase will run from November 2011 to February 2012, followed by a four month period of initial assessment and further engagement on how the regime might be refined to mitigate any impacts of particular concern and deliver additional benefits.

The second phase will run from July 2012 to September 2012, providing the added benefit of enabling greater resilience during the London Olympic and Paralympic Games when the UK's airports will be under more pressure than normal.  The trial will be undertaken by BAA, the airport operator, under the supervision of the Civil Aviation Authority, the independent aviation regulator.

BAA will be required to engage fully and transparently with relevant local authorities, communities and other stakeholders throughout the process, particularly on the monitoring of noise impacts. Once assessed, the results of the trial will form the basis for a consultation with local communities which would in due course inform the Government in deciding whether an operational freedoms regime should be adopted at Heathrow.

I am grateful to the Taskforce members not only for their constructive input into the Taskforce over the past few months, but also for their continuing commitment to delivering real improvements for passengers.  I intend to reconvene the Taskforce in a year's time to review the progress made.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110714,Regulation of Aviation Security,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** Today I am launching a [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-21) on the Government's proposals to modernise the way we regulate aviation security. Better regulation for aviation security proposes a new outcome focused, risk-based approach to regulation which builds on the successful and similar approach to aviation safety.

Whilst the UK is recognised internationally as having one of the most effective aviation security regimes in the world, we also face a continuing threat from international and domestic terrorism. The Government's recent Strategic Defence and Security Review set out its proposals for securing Britain in an age of uncertainty and included a commitment to improve aviation security.

The proposals in this consultation offer a new approach to the regulation of aviation security. Our current system can place significant financial burdens on the aviation industry along with inconvenience to passengers, and could be more consistent with the Government's better regulation principles. I think we can do better - with a new regime which maintains and improves security standards but in a more efficient and passenger-friendly way.

I therefore propose that the Government should move from prescribing security processes to setting security outcomes. This will give airports and airlines greater flexibility to deliver high standards of security in ways that that are better integrated with their day-to-day business and designed around the needs of the passenger. It will allow them to adopt appropriate new technology as it become available. I want to move away from the current, highly prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach where all operators run the same regime to one where industry takes a more proactive and more innovative and tailored approach to security.

This approach will also enable the Regulator to operate a system of ""earned autonomy"" - rewarding those operators with the most robust systems of aviation security with greater trust in how they deliver the specified outcomes. Conversely, the level of scrutiny by the Regulator will increase proportionately where any concerns arise about the delivery of the required outcomes.

The safety and security of passengers will remain of paramount importance to the Government, and so the new arrangements will have robust oversight procedures in place to ensure security standards are not compromised. To do this, I am proposing to require all industry operators to develop a Security Management System. This would demonstrate a clear commitment to providing an overall high level of security and set out how security outcomes specified by the UK Regulator and EU requirements will be delivered. Integral to this will be robust internal quality assurance and auditing arrangements which will complement the Regulator's own assurance and compliance processes.

The consultation also proposes new reporting arrangements whereby industry will regularly report to the Regulator on performance and occurrences (including the rectification measures to be taken). This gives the Regulator a fuller picture on which to base decisions and direct regulatory effort. I also propose to introduce a system that allows staff to report on a confidential basis any concerns relating to aviation security. These proposed arrangements will provide an additional layer of assurance.

This approach offers a new partnership between Government and the industry, one that is dedicated to maintaining the highest standards in aviation security whilst also improving the passenger experience.

These are complex proposals, which require further development in consultation with the aviation industry and other interested parties. The Department for Transport will be making extensive efforts to engage industry during the consultation process to explain the proposals further and to seek input.

Following the end of the consultation, the Government will then consider all responses and produce a summary report along with next steps. I will make a further statement to the House at that point.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110714,Humber Bridge (Debts) Order 2011,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am pleased to announce that I have today laid the Humber Bridge (Debts) Order 2011 before Parliament.

The Order provides for the interest rate payable on the debt owed by the Humber Bridge Board to the Department for Transport to continue to remain at the reduced rate equivalent to 4.25 per cent on the total debt of £332 million during the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2016. The debt represents borrowing from Government for the construction of the Humber Bridge and the subsequent capitalisation of annual deficits in the early years of its operation.

Without this Order, the interest rate payable on that part of the debt not suspended (£275 million) would revert to 7.75 per cent, as set by the Humber Bridge (Debts) Order 1998.

The value of the interest rate reduction to the Humber Bridge Board amounts to £48 million over the five years, which the Board can use to fund maintenance and renewals and/or to make capital repayments.

This Order demonstrates a major commitment by this Government to the council tax payers, travelling public and businesses of the Humber area. Without it, the Humber Bridge Board would have been obliged either to surcharge council tax payers in the Humber area, or to increase the tolls on the bridge by as much as 60 per cent.

The arrangement forms part of the base case for second phase of the Humber Bridge Review announced on 14 June, and is made separately to the process of the Review, which is now under way and on which the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I will make a further announcement in November.

I have stated that the reduced interest rate on the loan is the equivalent of 4.25 per cent payable on the entire debt of £332 million. In 2011/12 this will comprise 5.13% charged on the active portion of the debt (£275 million) and nil payable on the suspended portion of the debt (£57 million). As set out in the 1998 Order, the suspended portion of the debt will progressively be added back into the active debt over the three years to 2014. The interest rate will be reduced accordingly to equate to the 4.25 per cent on the whole debt. Therefore the rate payable on the active debt in the three years 2011/12 to 2013/14 will be 5.13 per cent, 4.82 per cent and 4.52 per cent respectively.

This Order is made under the provisions of the Humber Bridge (Debts) Act 1996, and comes into force on 9 August.  Upon the coming into force of this Order, a revised loan agreement will be signed between the Secretary of State and the Humber Bridge Board.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110714b,Coastguard modernisation,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** With permission Mr Speaker I wish to make a statement on the Government's intentions on taking forward the process of Coastguard modernisation in the light of responses received to the [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/consultations/mcga-consultations-archive/hm_coastguard_proposals_for_modernisation_consultation_2010.htm) that ended on 5 May 2011.

The key drivers behind the modernisation proposals are the need to address the limited resilience of current arrangements, distribute more effectively the workload experienced by different Coastguard stations, and provide enhanced opportunities for Coastguard officers to develop professional skills, with pay levels reflecting enhanced responsibilities. There is also a need to contribute to the wider deficit reduction agenda.

The consultation set out proposals to create a nationally networked Coastguard system with two Maritime Operations Centres - one in the Southampton/ Portsmouth area and one in Aberdeen - together with a 24 hour centre at Dover and five daytime only centres. In addition to delivering greater resilience and better career progression, the proposals identified ways of managing costs while still delivering high levels of service to seafarers and the public. It also set out our commitment to increase by 32 the number of regular coastguards to strengthen the frontline volunteer coastguard.

Mr Speaker, these drivers for change remain. Our strategic objectives in this exercise remain unaltered. But throughout the consultation process I have been clear that we were willing to listen to views of the public, coastguard staff and other interested parties on the best way to deliver the outcomes we need to achieve. Over 1,800 responses were received, including many from serving coastguards. Of the total, 27 submissions suggested specific alternative solutions, all with a reduced number of stations but with differing concepts of operations. We are very grateful to all of those who responded to the consultation and to the Transport Select Committee for also looking at the issues. I can say, Mr Speaker, that this has been a model of consultation, with many serious and thoughtful responses recognising the need to deliver the overall objectives, but proposing alternative ways of doing so.

There were a number of common themes that emerged from the consultation responses. These were:

  * first, widespread acceptance, as illustrated by all the alternative solutions that were put forward, that change is necessary;
  * secondly, concerns about the potential loss of local knowledge and local contacts with volunteer coastguards and other search and rescue partners; and,
  * third, concerns over how the detailed concept of operations for the Maritime Operation Centres and sub-centres would work in practice, particularly how a handover between a day time centre and a 24/7 Maritime Operations Centre would work in practice.

A review of all the consultation responses has been produced under the leadership of a Non-Executive Director of the MCA, involving a number of serving coastguard officers and members of the PCS union. This has been placed in the Library of the House. A formal response from the Government to the report of the Transport Select Committee will be provided separately.

In the light of the consultation responses, the Government has now concluded as follows:

  * that it remains right to continue with the proposals for a nationally networked system with the introduction of one Maritime Operations Centre capable of managing incidents anywhere and ensuring optimum distribution of workload across the system;
  * establishing one Maritime Operations Centre, rather than the two previously proposed allows us to address concerns over local knowledge and the robustness of the future concept of operations by retaining one of each of the current paired stations, with the retained centres operating as part of the nationally networked system 24 hours a day rather than during daytime only - staff in each of the current 'pair' of stations are already familiar with, and frequently experience, management of incidents in an adjacent area;
  * we have also decided that the Northern Ireland Coastguard centre at Bangor should be retained because of the specific requirement to manage the civil contingency arrangements unique to Northern Ireland and the relationship with search and rescue partners in the Irish Republic with whom we coordinate closely in air sea rescues in the waters around the island of Ireland;
  * in light of the decision to retain one station from each pair, and concerns about Welsh language communication, it has been decided to retain the Holyhead station, rather than the one at Liverpool;
  * in response to concerns expressed over the resilience of infrastructure and communication links within the Scottish Islands and with the Scottish mainland, we have decided to retain Coastguard centres in both Stornoway and Shetland;
  * that in the light of a further review of the potential costs of vacating the existing sites in Swansea and Milford Haven, which has shown that there are no financial reasons to favour either location, and in view of my Department's already very substantial levels of employment in Swansea, we have decided that we should retain the coastguard centre at Milford Haven rather than the centre at Swansea;

In summary, subject to consultation on the changes to the previously announced approach, we will now proceed with the creation of a modernised coastguard service providing a nationally networked system comprising:

  * one Maritime Operations Centre in the Southampton/Portsmouth area with a disaster recovery back-up facility at the Dover station, which will retain its responsibilities for the Channel Navigation Information Service and will also serve as a sub-centre; and,
  * a further eight sub-centres, all operated on a 24 hour basis, located at Falmouth, Milford Haven, Holyhead, Belfast, Stornoway, Shetland, Aberdeen and Humber.

The stations at Clyde, Forth, Portland, Liverpool, Yarmouth, Brixham, Thames and Swansea will close progressively over the period 2012 to 2014/15. The station at Solent will be replaced by a new Maritime Operations Centre in the Portsmouth/Southampton area and the small station at London is unaffected by these proposals.

These revised proposals will deliver the modernisation required and are capable of delivering the same level of savings in the longer term as our previous proposals. They are right for the future of the Coastguard service. I recognise, of course, that they will nonetheless represent a huge disappointment to honourable members whose constituencies are affected by the proposed closures.

The additional costs generated by retaining a total of ten centres overall (plus London), all operating on a 24 hour basis, and the higher Coastguard numbers that will be needed to do so, will be offset by operating only one Maritime Operations Centre in the Southampton/Portsmouth area, with a back-up centre, equipped but not staffed, at Dover. By moving to more efficient watch patterns we will still be able to offer higher pay across the service to reflect higher levels of responsibility, while ensuring that costs overall remain within our planned funding for the coastguard as a whole.

The changes to the original consultation proposal that I have announced today will be the subject of a further period of consultation. This will run for twelve weeks from today, ending on 6 October 2011. Specifically, this includes the decision to retain Holyhead rather than Liverpool; the choice of Milford Haven rather than Swansea; the decision to retain stations at Shetland and Stornoway; and the decision to operate a single Maritime Operations Centre, rather than two.

These changes to our original proposals will deliver the modernised and more cost effective service we need for the 21st century while also responding to the genuine concerns raised during the consultation process and I commend them to the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110719,Olympic airspace,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** On 7 March the Government announced plans to introduce temporary airspace restrictions in the South East of England during the London Olympic and Paralympic Games to help protect key Games locations from potential airborne risks. We also made clear that further work would be done to evaluate the potential impact of these measures before final decisions were made. Additional work was also envisaged on possible exemptions and alleviations to mitigate the impact of the proposed restrictions on the aviation industry where possible, without reducing the effectiveness and robustness of the security measures.

Since March further extensive work has been done in conjunction with the aviation sector to understand the likely impact of the planned restrictions on the industry. Alongside this, security experts have also carried out further analysis on the risks to the Games. This work has given us a more sophisticated understanding of the relative challenges as regards the Olympics and the Paralympics. The changes to the original measures have been made to minimise the impact of the restrictions without compromising the safety and security of the Games.

As a result of both this improved understanding and work with the aviation community, the Government is today announcing further development of the plans for temporary airspace control measures.

Between 14 July and 15 August 2012, the airspace measures will, as previously proposed, comprise an inner Prohibited Zone and an outer Restricted Zone, approximately 60 nautical miles across, centred on the Olympic Park.

Only certain categories of aircraft - those operating commercial services and subject to full aviation security procedures - will normally be permitted to operate within the Prohibited Zone. Aircraft involved in, for example, police, emergency medical, essential survey and Olympic Broadcast operations will be exempt. Subject to specific conditions, exemptions will also be granted to flights operating from Denham, Fairoaks and White Waltham airfields, and the London Heliport at Battersea - all located within the Prohibited Zone - directly to and from the boundary with the Restricted Zone.

As previously proposed, all types of aircraft will be permitted to operate in the wider Restricted Zone during this period provided that they can satisfy certain requirements designed to ensure that aircraft within the Zone can be readily identified and monitored by air traffic control. Additional changes to the original plans are now proposed, including exemptions for flights directly exiting the Restricted Zone from airfields within 3 nautical miles of the Zone's outer boundary, and the removal of the prohibition against cross country solo student flights. Small changes to the boundaries of the Prohibited and Restricted Zones are also being made, primarily for reasons of air traffic safety and ease of navigation. Further work is underway to look at whether the current minimum period for filing a flight plan can be reduced from the existing 2 hours.

From 16 August until the Paralympic Village closes on 12 September 2012, the Prohibited and Restricted Zones will be replaced by three separate, smaller, areas of restricted airspace one over Central London and the Olympic Park, one over the Eton Dorney Paralympic rowing venue, and one over the rowing Village at Egham. Access to this airspace will be restricted to those aircraft permitted to operate within the earlier Prohibited Zone. A specific exemption will be granted in respect of operations into and out of the London Heliport.

A similar approach - the introduction of localised areas of temporarily restricted airspace - will be taken in respect of the Games venues elsewhere across the country as and when appropriate during the Games period.

Full details of the planned airspace restrictions, including maps, can be found on the [Airspace Safety Initiative](http://www.airspacesafety.com/Olympics) web site.

It is not expected that any airports will need to close as a result of the planned measures. There should be no impact on scheduled air services, and a significantly reduced impact on most other types of operation within the Prohibited and Restricted Zones as a result of the changes made to the design and duration of the restrictions.

The Government's paramount objective is the delivery of a safe and secure Games for all. We are confident that the measures announced today are a proportionate approach, balancing the need to put in place appropriate and effective counter-measures against potential aviation based risks to the Games with the desire to minimise the impact on the aviation community.

However, should circumstances change, the Government reserves the right to implement additional airspace security measures should the need arise.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110805,New franchising programme,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport, Philip Hammond:** The Government is committed to a major reform of rail franchising that will benefit passengers and taxpayers alike. In preparing our policies we have paid careful attention to the views the rail industry, and others, have expressed to us. Our reforms will create longer, less prescriptive franchises that will give the industry more freedom to innovate, address passenger needs, and more incentive to invest. The reforms will also help achieve the radical efficiency changes needed for a sustainable lower cost railway for the long term. This will include a more equitable balance of risk between the public and private sectors, including replacement of the 'cap and collar' revenue support mechanism with one linked to economic indicators. There will also be stronger emphasis on partnership and closer working between train operators and their local Network Rail Route teams, allowing integrated decision-making which benefits passengers and drives out cost.

These new type of rail franchises will replace existing ones, as and when they expire, and I have today published a comprehensive forward timetable for the re-letting of rail franchises that represents a deliverable and balanced programme. My aim in doing so is to give the market clarity about the timing of the opportunities that will arise. In producing this timetable, I have had regard to the impact on bidders and their sub-contractors of trying to compete for too many franchises at once, and the likely reduction in value for money to the taxpayer that would result.

In summary, the new programme is as follows:

As I have already announced, the new Inter City West Coast franchise will commence in December 2012, with an Invitation to Tender (ITT) issued to the pre-qualified bidders in January 2012.

Following First Group's decision not to exercise its contractual entitlement to take up a 3-year extension on its existing Greater Western contract from 2013, this will now be the next long-distance franchise to come to market, with the new franchise commencing in April 2013, instead of 2016 as originally planned.

As a result, and to avoid having to offer more than one long-distance franchise competition at the same time, with possible consequences for taxpayer value, the new Inter City East Coast franchise will commence in December 2013.

Turning to commuter franchises, there is no change in my plans for Essex Thameside, with the new 15 year contract due to commence in May 2013. The same is true for South Eastern, where the new franchise will start in April 2014.

In light of the likely delivery timescales for Thameslink rolling stock, I judge it right to exercise my contractual entitlement to bring forward the start of a new franchise to September 2013. The franchise is likely to be shorter than 15 years, with a focus on managing services through the major Thameslink infrastructure upgrade. It would then be re-let at the end of the project.

To accommodate the changed dates for Thameslink and Inter City East Coast, I intend to move the start of the long term 15 year Greater Anglia franchise to July 2014, exercising the 12 month extension that is included in to the short franchise that is currently being competed.

I have concluded an agreement with First Keolis TransPennine Express (TPE) which extends the current franchise. The extension incorporates the flexibility to terminate the franchise between April 2014 and March 2015. This flexibility could allow the start dates for the new Northern and TransPennine franchises to be aligned in April 2014, by also exercising the short extension provision in the current Northern franchise. Having both existing franchises end at the same date could allow for these franchises to be combined, or split in different ways. I will be considering the optimal configuration and intend to seek views on the optimum structure from local interested parties. The timescales outlined above will allow for proper consultation and consideration of the possibilities of a radical restructuring in the Northern/TPE area.

In summary, Great Western and Thameslink have come forward (by 35 months and 18 months respectively), the Northern and TPE franchises could now be aligned with a start date of April 2014 - so that we have greater flexibility in re-letting - and two other franchises (Inter City East Coast and Greater Anglia) have been pushed back to accommodate the acceleration of Great Western and Thameslink. Three franchises (Inter City West Coast, South Eastern and Essex Thameside) remain unchanged.
I have already been clear that not all of these franchises will look the same. I believe in horses for courses and a pragmatic, not dogmatic, approach. I will be guided by what drives value for the taxpayer and service for the passenger on each individual franchise.

Some commentators have suggested this represents a huge programme of work and a major culture shift in Government. I agree with them. It is arguably the biggest programme of franchising since the industry was originally privatised. But it is also a major programme - and a significant culture shift - for bidders. There should be no doubt about our determination to deliver on this agenda, nor the importance of managing it properly.

Revising the programme in this way, while remaining clear about our objectives reflects my view that success depends on having a crystal-clear and unwavering strategy, coupled with a willingness and ability to be agile and tactical in implementing it.

The end result of this work will be a new rail franchising system that delivers better outcomes for passengers and better value for money for taxpayers.

The UK was represented by officials. The theme was: ""Mobilizing private financing for transport infrastructure"". The debate was based on a number of questions put by the Presidency, which were principally about the use of Public-Private Partnerships.

The key points conveyed by the UK are as follows:

  * For the UK, the primary factor determining PPP use is whether it offers the best value for money compared to alternative delivery options. The features that impact on the value for money decision include: public sector access to private sector capital and expertise and the transfer of financial risk from the public to the private sector.
A key feature of the UK public sector comparator process is that it is not entirely based on a quantitative calculation of the respective delivery outcomes. The calculation is supported by a qualitative assessment of the respective delivery routes in terms of their viability, desirability and achievability.
  * The UK set out several examples of the use of PPP in the transport sector, which included contracts for street lighting, highway maintenance and London Underground. We reported that that the experience of PPP in this sector has been mixed. While PPP programmes have helped secure significant infrastructure investment and, in a number of cases, achieved an improved record on the delivery of projects to time and budget, this has only been achieved by repeated interventions.
  * Work has recently been undertaken to achieve a stronger focus on flexibility. Project reviews are being undertaken to improve the delivery of cost reductions and value for money. New PPP projects are subject to tougher approval and assurance processes. The UK no longer uses the PPP format to source projects for which there is an insufficient capital requirement or continuing lifecycle maintenance/service obligation, or for lower value projects.
  * The UK emphasised that while PPP remains a useful procurement option, it is not suitable for every project and should only be selected when it can demonstrate that it provides a better value for money outcome than conventional procurement processes.
  * The UK noted that a fundamental feature of PPP structures is that they provide for availability payments over the life of a long-term service contract. However, EU regulations only provide for availability payments that are linked to development and construction pre-payments. If operational availability payments are not permitted, this could distort the decision-making process on the type of PPP structure that is adopted and unnecessarily constrain the options available to Member States.

Since it was established in 2006, the MIRG has responded to just six fire incidents and has not had a significant impact on the outcome of any of those. Since February the MCA has consulted those Fire and Rescue Services providing the current MIRG capability.

Feedback from the shipping industry suggests that the most valued service provided by the MIRG is their initial fire assessment advice. The MCA had therefore initially hoped that the Fire and Rescue Services providing the current MIRG capability would be able to provide such a service, but agreement on this has not been possible. The Government therefore intends to establish alternative arrangements for such a fire assessment and advice service using commercial salvors.

Under the new arrangements professional personnel will be deployed to an incident to make an assessment of the status of a fire and to provide advice on the best course of action and - as in many cases today - reassure port authorities that a ship can be safely accepted into a port so that shore based fire fighters can attend to the fire. This approach recognises that international legislation already requires that all ships' crews are trained and equipped to fight fires on ships.

The new service will not require funding from the public purse as costs will be recoverable. A 90 day notice period will begin today and the existing MIRG arrangement will end on 14 December 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110915,Sale of Trust Ports,Philip Hammond issues a revised policy to follow when considering an application under the Ports Act 1991 for the sale of a major trust port.,"**The Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond):** On 3 August 2011, I announced the criteria that the Government will consider particularly relevant to the appropriateness of the sale of a major trust port in England or Wales under the Ports Act 1991.  This followed the consultation that I announced on 16 May 2011 [_Official Report_ Column 4WS] and which closed on 27 June.  I regret that it was not possible to announce this first by Written Ministerial Statement to the House, but I did not wish to delay consideration of the application by Dover Harbour Board for a transfer scheme.

I am aware that Dover Harbour Board has now considered the criteria, intends to proceed with its application for a transfer scheme under the Ports Act 1991, and proposes to submit a new set of documents containing a further elaboration of its scheme for decision by the Minister of State under the new criteria.  If  interested parties would find it useful and seek my department's assistance, we would be happy to consider ways in which properly to facilitate discussions on all the options before the Dover Harbour Board submits its elaborated proposal. I should make clear that the decision minister would take no part in such discussions and would continue to perform her statutory functions in an objective, impartial manner whatever the outcome of any such discussions.

The following paragraphs set out the revised policy which the Secretary of State expects to follow when considering an application under the Ports Act 1991 for the sale of a major trust port in England or Wales. This covers the consideration of any proposal for a transfer scheme submitted under section 9 or 10 of the 1991 Act, together with the exercise of the Secretary of State's functions in respect of the subsequent sale of the port to which the scheme relates. The Secretary of State also intends to have particular regard to the policy considerations set out below before making a transfer scheme himself under section 12 of the 1991 Act or subsequently approving the sale of a port to which such a scheme relates.

## 1. Essential Criteria

  * **Community participation**
The Secretary of State will not approve an application for the sale of a trust port under the 1991 Act unless the sale is considered likely to deliver an enduring and significant level of community participation in the port. Such participation could take a variety of forms, but must include the ability to influence the port's long term development and may include the right to receive a share in the profits of the port, or the future increase in its value. It does not necessarily require a community role in the operation of the port.
  * **Future investment in, and development of, the port**
The Secretary of State will not approve an application unless the sale is considered likely to deliver an ownership model with the capability and access to capital to meet future investment needs and to exploit development potential of the port.
  * **Fair price**
The Secretary of State will not approve an application unless the sale is considered likely to represent good value for money, having regard not only to Exchequer proceeds and market conditions, but also to other benefits including those to the community and the wider economy.
  * **Fair competition**
The Secretary of State will not approve an application that is likely to deliver an ownership model which results in unsatisfactory levels of competition in the relevant sector.

## 2. Highly Desirable criteria

  * **Transport networks**
It is highly desirable for an application to be likely to deliver an ownership model which will cause the port to be operated so as to contribute to reliable, resilient and efficient transport networks.
  * **Sale process**
It is highly desirable that the sale should be conducted in such a way as to give all bona fide prospective purchasers a fair and equitable opportunity to participate.

## 3. Desirable criteria

  * **Employee involvement**
It is desirable for an application to be likely to deliver port employee participation in the ownership of the port, such as the right to receive equity shares or a share in its future success******.

******This is without prejudice to the Ports Act 1991 section 5(3) requirement to have particular regard to the desirability of encouraging the disposal of the whole or a substantial part of the equity share capital of the successor company to managers or other persons employed by the port company etc.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20111011,Consultation on High-volume Semi-trailers,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** Further to my [statement](http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110330b) of 30 March 2011 (Official Report col 23WS), the Department for Transport has today published its [response](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-06) to the consultation on a proposal to allow a 2.05 metre increase in the length of semi-trailers and a maximum overall length for articulated heavy goods vehicles of 18.75 metres.

The research underlying the consultation proposal suggests that high volume semi-trailers have potential environmental, safety and congestion benefits: they would allow up to 13% more loading space than current articulated lorries, resulting in fewer journeys needed to transport the same volume of goods.

The research predicts that by 2015 this would reduce lorry miles in the UK by 100 - 180 million a year, meaning reduced congestion, reduced air pollution and reduced carbon emissions (by around 100,000 tonnes a year reduction). The research also found that there would be a net decrease in casualties of around 1.6% from the reduction in lorry miles.

However, the evidence provided during the consultation exercise has identified a number of areas which merit additional investigation.These include possible effects if the number of longer semi-trailers introduced is significantly higher than that predicted by the research and the impact assessment attached to the consultation document; the impacts of longer semi-trailers on road infrastructure and design and on depot and distribution centre infrastructure and design; the impacts on SMEs of allowing longer semi-trailers; and the effectiveness of additional vision/sensor/safety systems fitted to improve detection of vulnerable road users.

The research underlying the consultation proposals was comprehensive. To gather further evidence on such impacts will therefore require a trial of longer semi-trailers in operation. The Department therefore intends to proceed with an operational trial of longer semi-trailers in order to gather practical evidence. Trailers taking part in the trial will operate under Vehicle Special Orders issued under Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.

The Department considers that the number of vehicles permitted in the trial will need to be limited, but that the number permitted should still allow meaningful evidence to be gathered on the likely take-up of longer semi-trailers across the vehicle fleet as well as their impact on infrastructure. This would require a trial of vehicle numbers that allows operators to swap a sufficient percentage of their fleet over to the longer semi-trailer to enable them to remove standard trailers from their fleet and make an effective comparison of performance.

The responses to the consultation also indicate that different businesses would wish to choose between additional trailer lengths of up to 1m and up to 2.05m, depending on the nature of their business. The trial provides an opportunity to validate the impacts of each length. The current trailer parc for articulated vehicle above 40 tonnes in the UK is estimated at around 100,000 trailers. The Department intends to proceed with a trial of up to 900 trailers of an increased length of up to 2.05m; and 900 trailers of an increased length of up to 1m, 1,800 trailers forming just under 2% of trailers on British roads.

Our baseline research shows that the ability to operate longer semi trailers would provide clear benefits to business and a spur to efficiency and growth. We expect the trial itself to offer a net present value of £33m, largely due to the financial benefits operators should see over the 10 year length of the trial (around £1,800 per vehicle per year). We would expect many of these benefits to flow through to the consumer.

Participation in the trial will be on a voluntary basis and at the participants' own risk; there is no guarantee that the use of the longer semi-trailers will continue to be permitted beyond the end of the trial period. The trial will run for 10 years, to allow those businesses wishing to participate the opportunity to cover the costs of investment in the longer semi-trailers. Expressions of Interest are invited from today, with the trial starting in January 2012. Information on how to apply can be found on the DfT website.

However, the Department wishes the trial to be closely monitored, to ensure that any significant issues, particularly on safety, that arise are addressed quickly and to ensure that the trial is meeting the Department's objectives.

The Department will therefore appoint an independent contractor to monitor and review trial progress. The contractor will report to the Department on a four monthly basis; at the end of each trial year the Department will review progress towards objectives, including considering any changes to the length of the trial and the numbers of trailers involved in the trial.

Although many of the responses from vehicle operators supported the development of tractor units with a safer more aerodynamic frontal design, it was evident from the majority of responses received from vehicle manufacturers that they are unlikely to progress with the development of improved frontal designs at this time. Therefore, the Department has decided not to include tractor units with an extension of up to 0.4 metres for improved frontal designs in the trial. However, we are keeping the situation under review.

The UK was represented by officials.

There was a Policy Debate on a draft Regulation amending Regulation 3821/85 on **recording equipment in road transport** and amending regulation 561/2006. The UK reiterated our support for measures that reduce burdens on business and expressed doubts that the costs and benefits of the Commission's proposal had been fully assessed. The Presidency noted that discussions were at an early stage and that consideration would continue at official level.

The mandate for enlarging the geographical scope of the existing **Interbus Agreement** was not discussed at the Council.

The Council agreed two negotiating mandates in the area of **aviation external relations**:

  * The first was to negotiate a High Level Agreement with the European Organisation for Safety of Air Navigation (**EUROCONTROL**).
  * The second was to open negotiations on a comprehensive air transport agreement with **Azerbaijan**.

The Council adopted Conclusions on the Commission Communication on ""The **EU and its neighbouring regions**: A renewed approach to transport cooperation"". A number of member states intervened in support. The Conclusions have taken on board UK's key concerns and are set broadly to maximise the opportunities for trade liberalisation, economic integration and regulatory convergence.

A lunchtime discussion on **trans-European transport network** was held. The UK stressed the need for realism on the TENs budget in the current economic climate and emphasised that decisions on which projects should be developed and invested in on national networks should remain with the member states concerned. Legislative proposals for all trans-European networks (transport, energy and digital communication) are expected to be published on 19 October.

Among AOB items, discussions were held on the **Emissions Trading System (ETS) for Aviation**. The Presidency noted that the ECJ had published an Advocate General's opinion which concluded that the Aviation ETS Directive was compatible with EU law. The Commission provided oral information noting that the situation was getting highly political and would require a united EU approach to face off third countries' opposition. The UK intervened to reiterate its commitment to the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS and its support of the Advocate General's opinion.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20111013,Traffic signs review,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Great Britain has one of the safest road networks in the world and the quality and clarity of our traffic signs make a significant contribution to this. The Department for Transport has now completed the most significant review of traffic signs for over forty years to ensure that this traffic sign system continues to meet the needs of road users now and in the future.

I am pleased to announce that the Department is today publishing the policy document, ""Signing the Way"", which sets out the findings of the review. This document provides a framework for a new traffic sign system which retains national consistency, but reduces central government involvement in local decisions, reducing costs and giving local authorities the flexibility to respond to local needs. It also sets out our proposals for streamlining the Traffic Regulation Order process which would reduce costs and time.

The review recognises that our travel behaviour is changing and that people are being encouraged to cycle and to walk where practical. The traffic sign system needs to reflect these changes and this review will ensure that our traffic signs meet the needs of all road users.

Traffic signs also directly affect how much clutter there is on our roads. While road users require traffic signs to undertake their journeys safely and legally, too much signing creates an untidy, unattractive and confusing environment. The review sets out measures to reduce the number of signs on the road and provides advice to local authorities on removing unnecessary signing.

The Review requires a major update of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions and the Department is proceeding with this work as a priority. In the interim, we will deliver changes where possible through the Secretary of State's traffic signs authorisation process.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20111020,Greater Anglia rail franchise,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** I can today announce that Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been awarded the Greater Anglia (Short) franchise.

The new franchise will begin operation on Sunday 5 February 2012. It will operate for 29 months (32 rail industry periods).

Bids were received from Abellio Greater Anglia Limited (NV Nederlandse Spoorwegen), Eastern Railway Limited (Go-Ahead Group PLC), and Stagecoach Anglia Trains Limited (Stagecoach Group plc).

Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been chosen to run trains on the network, which operates across Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. The franchise will also play a significant role in transport for the London 2012 Games providing crucial services to the Olympic Park area.

The terms of the contract the Government has agreed with the winning bidder will deliver a series of improvements for passengers during the 29 month franchise.

These include providing better station and ticket facilities and measures to improve passenger information. A text messaging service to keep passengers informed if service disruption occurs will be introduced. New information desks will be provided at major stations including London Liverpool Street, Cambridge, Norwich, Ipswich and Stansted Airport.

The new franchise will make it easier for passengers to buy tickets, including:

  * extending Oyster Pay As You Go between London Liverpool Street and all stations to Shenfield, and stations to Hertford East
  * improvements to ticket vending machines, and
  * introducing mobile phone and print-at-home ticketing facilities.

Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has also committed to provide an additional 600 car park spaces (subject to planning approvals), more cycle storage facilities and deliver a number of other measures to improve the service to customers including deep cleaning of stations and trains.

The train company will take over station leases from Network Rail, taking on responsibility for all repairs and renewals at stations. This accords with the Government's overall franchise reform programme which advocates transfer of more responsibility for stations to train operators as the passenger-facing side of the rail industry.

To date, only overall figures for the performance of the franchise as a whole have been published. From the start of the new franchise, Abellio Greater Anglia Limited will start publishing a break down of punctuality figures by route giving passengers more transparency over the performance of the lines they use. The reliability requirements for the new franchise are also more demanding than the previous one.

When the franchise is renewed again in July 2014, the contract is expected to be 15 years in length. This forthcoming franchise will provide the opportunity to seek further improvements for passengers. We also intend to draw on the work of Sir Roy McNulty in setting the terms of the franchise with the aim of reducing costs and improving efficiency.

I am also publishing, on the Department's website, a written response to the consultation and an updated version of the Appraisal of Sustainability that had been published as part of the consultation process.

The ports industry is a vital contributor to this country's economic recovery and success. Well over 90% of trade by tonnage passes through sea ports, and so the importance of a clear planning framework for their future sustainable development can hardly be overstated.

The NPS gives full prominence to the importance of development in sympathy with the environment, while also stressing the national need for developers' commercial judgements to be respected in what continues to be a successful, market-oriented and responsible sector.

It has been agreed with the House that the same procedure as proposed in the Localism Bill will be followed for the NPS. The Secretary of State intends to designate the NPS after a period of 21 sitting days has elapsed, or following a debate in the House of Commons if the House wishes one, and approves the NPS, within that period.

The ATOL Reform Consultation, which took place between 23 June and 15 September 2011, proposed that the new regulations for bringing Flight Plus holidays into ATOL would come into force on 1 January 2012.

Over 80 responses to the consultation were received.  The final details of the ATOL reforms are being decided in light of these responses.  However the overwhelming view from the travel industry has been that implementation on 1 January 2012 would provide insufficient time for businesses to make the necessary preparations to comply with the new requirements.  This is partly due to the time needed to update IT systems and put in place the processes required to enable businesses to identify when a Flight Plus holiday has been formed.

In recognition of these concerns, and to ensure that the new regulations are implemented fully, consistently and in a way that minimises the scope for error and subsequent confusion amongst passengers, I have decided that the new regulations will not now come into force on 1 January.  Instead I intend to implement the reforms in April 2012 in order to give the industry enough time to respond to these new consumer protection requirements.

I expect to make a further announcement before the end of the year about decisions on the other ATOL reform issues in the consultation.

It was further announced that the Department intended to enter into negotiations with the incumbent franchisee (West Coast Trains Ltd and Virgin Rail Group) to secure affordable and value for money operations until the start of the new franchise.

I am pleased to announce that the Department has now agreed an extension with West Coast Trains Limited and Virgin Rail Group. This agreement will extend their current franchise on the InterCity West Coast route from 1 April 2012 until the start of the new franchise.

Over the course of the extension three new 600-seat Pendolino trains will be added to the line. This is in addition to the new Pendolino train which entered service in July of this year. Also, 31 of the existing Pendolino trains will be lengthened from 9 to 11 carriages, increasing the number of standard class seats on each train by almost 50%, from 320 to 470. In all, 106 new carriages are being introduced on the route making 28,000 extra seats available each day, an increase of 25%. This will relieve crowding on some of the busiest parts of the West Coast Main Line which is one the UK economy's most important transport corridors.

Virgin will also be responsible for providing important services enabling people travel by train to the Olympic and Paralympic Games next summer.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20111103,Historic vehicles MoT exemption review,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department for Transport has today published a consultation on a proposal to exempt vehicles of historic interest (vehicles manufactured prior to 1 January 1960) in Great Britain (GB) from statutory MoT test, as allowed under Article 4(2) of the EU Directive 2009/40/EC.

The EU Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, Chapter II, Exceptions, Article 4 states: ""_Member States may, after consulting the Commission, exclude from the scope of this Directive, or subject to special provisions, certain vehicles operated or used in exceptional conditions and vehicles which are never, or hardly ever, used on public highways, including vehicles of historic interest which were manufactured before 1 January 1960 or which are temporarily withdrawn from circulation.  Member States may, after consulting the Commission, set their own testing standards for vehicles considered to be of historic interest._""

Sections 45 to 48 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 provide the legislative basis for MoT testing.  The purpose of the MoT test is to ensure that cars, other light vehicles (including some light goods vehicles), private buses and motorcycles over a prescribed age are checked at least once a year to see that they comply with key roadworthiness and environmental requirements in the Road Vehicle Construction and Use Regulations 1986 and the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989 (both as amended).

Whilst it is important to ensure that vehicles are safe to use on the highway, it is also important to ensure that regulations imposed are not excessive.  Currently, both the age and the categories of vehicles requiring the MoT test in GB go further than the EU Directive on roadworthiness test 2009/40/EC, which only subjects post-1960 registered vehicles to a compulsory roadworthiness test and does not require motorcycles of any age to do a statutory roadworthiness test.

The Government believes that the proposed exemption will reduce regulatory burden on owners of historic vehicles, meet its Reducing Regulation agenda and the desire to remove unnecessary burdens.  It will also bring the age of vehicles requiring the statutory MoT test in line with The Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) Regulations 1988, which already exempts unladen pre-1960 manufactured Heavy Goods Vehicles from the roadworthiness test.

Two-thirds of pre-1960 licensed vehicles (vehicles manufactured prior to 1 January 1960) are driven less than 500 miles each year.  This is significantly less than the 9,000 miles driven on average by all licensed vehicles.

Whilst the pre-1960 licensed vehicles made up about 0.6% of the approximately 35.2m licensed vehicles in GB in 2010, they were involved in just 0.03% of road casualties and accidents.  The pre-1960 licensed vehicles are largely well maintained by their owners.  The initial MoT test failure rate for these vehicles in 2009 was less than 10%, whilst the initial MoT test failure rate for post-1960 licensed vehicles was over 30%.

The purpose of the consultation is to invite views on proposals to exempt vehicles of historic interest from the statutory MoT test in GB.  In addition to no change, the consultation offers three options based on vehicle manufactured date, i.e. it seeks respondents' views on whether the Government should exempt from the statutory MoT test, pre-1960, pre-1945 or pre-1920 manufactured vehicles.

The consultation also seeks respondents' views (in all three options) on whether all vehicle categories and vehicles used for commercial purposes should be included in the exemption review.

The consultation will run until 26 January 2012.  Copies of the Consultation Document have been placed on the Library of the House. Further copies are available on the DfT website at [www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-27](/consultations/dft-2011-27).  Depending on comments received and the Department's response, amendments may be made to regulations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20111107,Responding to the consultation on the Renewable Energy Directive,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** Today I am publishing our response to the comments received in the consultation on our proposals for implementing the transport aspects of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), confirming action we will take to implement this Directive in the UK.

The RED requires the UK to source 10% of energy used in transport from renewable sources by 2020 and is closely related to the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) which requires fuel suppliers to land-based transport and similar applications to deliver a 6% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from their fuels by 2020.

Our policy on biofuels is relevant to both Directives. There remain a number of uncertainties regarding the sustainability of biofuels and their best use. However, I do believe that genuinely sustainable biofuels have an important role to play in our efforts to tackle climate change and in security of energy supply. This is particularly so in areas where there is no viable alternative fuel on the horizon such as for HGVs and aviation.

It is crucial that we do all we can to ensure that biofuels both deliver real greenhouse gas emission reductions and do not cause unacceptable environmental and social side effects in the process. There is much work being undertaken, nationally and internationally, to better understand the indirect effects related to biofuels and to investigate how the negative indirect effects can be reduced.

As the Directives currently stand, they do not take into account these indirect effects. While the extent of these impacts remains uncertain, there is robust evidence that widespread use of some biofuels can lead to significant indirect greenhouse gas emissions through the process known as indirect land use change (ILUC). The UK takes the issue of ILUC seriously. Earlier this year we published research on the scale of ILUC impacts and we are continuing to lead work on how to tackle these as well as encouraging the European Commission to address this issue on a Europe-wide scale with a robust solution. I have written to the European Commission twice, expressing the Government's concerns regarding ILUC and pressing for robust and proportionate action to be taken to address the impacts of ILUC.

There are concerns regarding the best use and deployment of biofuels. These concerns also extend to the issue of best use of biomass across all sectors. Since our consultations on the RED and FQD opened, the Committee on Climate Change has published advice on renewable energy. The Government is now considering this advice and awaiting the Committee's further advice on the best use of bioenergy across all sectors. Further evidence will also be drawn from the results of the Department's research into the best use of biofuels across transport modes and the Department's call for evidence on the future of aviation policy: [""Developing a sustainable framework for UK aviation: Scoping document""](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110509101621/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/open/2011-09/consultationdocument.pdf). In addition, the Government is working in a cross-departmental way to develop a bioenergy strategy which will look at the use of sustainable bioenergy across transport, heat and power as well as the impacts on other sectors.

The results of these reports and studies will establish a robust evidence base. When we have this evidence we will set biofuel targets beyond those set out to 2014 under the current Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO).

On the other hand, in response to those who have called for biofuel targets to be scrapped entirely, we continue to be of the view that there is a place for sustainable biofuels in our wider policy on carbon reduction. The UK must, in law, comply with the RED. Biofuels will be a key component in the achievement of these targets before that work has been completed.

We will prioritise implementation of the RED over that of the related FQD in order to ensure that financial reward is no longer given to those biofuels that do not meet the RED sustainability criteria. Most of what will be delivered through the FQD will be delivered by the closely-related RED, which we expect to be implemented through an amended Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation in December 2011, subject to the Parliamentary process.

Our consultations on proposals to implement the RED and FQD revealed a number of concerns regarding expansion of the RTFO to include fuels use in non-road mobile machinery (NRMM). Industry has requested additional time to prepare for this and we are considering how best to achieve this change. As such, we do not propose to bring into force any expansion of the RTFO to include NRMM fuels before April 2013.

In addition there remains uncertainty regarding key implementing measures for the FQD, which are currently being discussed at the European level.

However, we do intend to introduce new regulations to transpose the FQD requirement to reduce emissions by 6% by 2020, alongside new annual reporting requirements for fossil fuels and biofuels. We will be working towards putting the necessary legislation in place as soon as possible during the course of 2012.

The response published today sets out our decision to fully transpose all the sustainability criteria set out in the RED to ensure that the UK only rewards the supply of sustainable biofuel. Until we have a more robust evidence base, we cannot confidently set biofuel targets beyond those established under the current RTFO.

I would like to thank all those who took the time to respond to these consultations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111107,M5 Collision,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.

","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** Mr Speaker with permission I should like to make a statement to update the house about the serious collision on the M5 motorway in Somerset on Friday evening on the 4th of November.

As the House will be aware, at approximately eight twenty-five on Friday evening a road traffic collision occurred on the M5 northbound in Somerset involving multiple vehicles. Some of these vehicles subsequently caught fire. The incident occurred between Junction 25 Taunton and Junction 24 Bridgwater North, approximately a third of a mile north of Junction 25.

The emergency services and the Highways Agency responded to the incident immediately, and therefore a large number of emergency services vehicles and resources were able to attend the scene very quickly. At approximately 9pm Avon & Somerset Police declared a major incident based on the numbers of casualties and vehicles involved.

Due to the nature of the incident scene it took some time to confirm exactly how many people and vehicles were involved in the collision.  Avon & Somerset Police have now confirmed that 37 vehicles were involved in the collision.  Tragically, 7 people lost their lives.  A further 51 people were injured and were either treated at Musgrove Park Hospital, Yeovil District Hospital or at the scene.

I would like to again offer my - and I'm sure the House's - condolences to those who have lost friends or families in this horrific crash, as well our thoughts for those who have been injured.   The families of those who lost their lives are being supported by specially trained family liaison officers from Avon & Somerset police who will continue to work with them as long as they are needed.

Police investigations on the motorway were completed at ten past four on Sunday (6 Nov) and the scene was handed over to the Highways Agency and its contractors to begin repairs to the carriageway. The collision incident had caused a significant amount of damage to the highway; a stretch of 40 metres of road was damaged by fuel spillage from vehicles and a stretch of 60 metres was damaged by intense fire.   Two lanes of the southbound carriageway reopened yesterday at twenty past five, and following extensive resurfacing works, all lanes on the northbound carriageway reopened shortly before 9pm. The final remaining lane closure on the southbound carriageway was removed at twenty-five past nine last night, and the road is now running in both directions.

The Roads Minister visited the scene of the incident on Saturday, and I was there myself yesterday.  I was tremendously impressed by the determination and professionalism of staff from the emergency services - police, fire crews and ambulance staff - local hospitals and the Highways Agency, working with real dedication in the most difficult of circumstances.  Our efforts to deal with the scene also involved the Environment Agency.  The way in which all these agencies were able to work together highly effectively was critical in ensuring those involved in the accident were helped and treated speedily.  I pay tribute to Assistant Chief Constable Anthony Bangham who, as Gold Commander, led those efforts.

It was a harrowing and painstaking task for all concerned to deal with this incident and I would like to take this opportunity to massively thank all those involved for their efforts and bravery, including individual members of the public who were passing or near the incident (some of whom tried to help those trapped in vehicles).  I would particularly like to pay tribute to the local community, people and businesses, in and around Taunton.  From local people and hotels offering to accommodate relatives of those injured and members of the public offering support, to local off duty hospital staff turning up to their hospital to help provide care, it was humbling and inspiring to see how selflessly so many people were willing to offer their support to others who needed it.

It would be a mistake at this very early stage to speculate about the causes of the collision.  Investigations into the cause of the crash are still at a very early stage.  To put that in context the recovery phase only just finished yesterday and it is only today that the investigation phase becomes the key focus.  While Avon and Somerset police have indicated that the presence of smoke on the carriageway is a significant line of inquiry, Assistant Chief Constable Bangham has been clear to me that, in his words to me earlier today, it is 'far too early' to jump to conclusions on the causal factors of this incident.  Our first priority now must be to ensure that the police are able to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of the crash.

As I said, earlier today I spoke to the Assistant Chief Constable, Anthony Bangham, whose Avon and Somerset force are leading the ongoing investigation.   He told me that, given the large number of vehicles involved, the need to carefully look at the vehicles recovered and of course to talk to the many witnesses, it may be some weeks until the investigation can conclude on the cause or causes of this incident.  The police continue to appeal for witnesses, and I encourage anyone with any information to contact the police directly on 101 or by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 500 111.

Mr Speaker I would like to emphasise to the House the extremely high priority that I attach to road safety.  The UK has a proud tradition as a world leader on road safety and that is a tradition that I am determined to continue.  Although the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads has fallen dramatically over the last 20 years the horrific crash on Friday has reminded us of the terrible personal consequences of collisions for motorists and local communities.   This government published earlier this year a road safety framework which commits us to a range of activities which will help us to do even better in future.

We will of course take full account of any lessons from this terrible collision in developing our future policies, and supporting the future safe travel of our people.  The safety of our roads also requires effective partnership working across a wide range of organisations - national and local government, police and emergency services and many others.  We need to work effectively together if we are to do the best job we can of ensuring people stay safe on our roads.

Over the coming weeks, and going beyond any lessons that may be learned from this particular incident, I will be considering carefully our forward plans on road safety, to ensure that we have the right measures in place to deliver real and urgent progress with tackling the continuing blight of death and injury on our roads.

I commend this statement to the House.

","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** As the House will know, since taking up office as Secretary of State, a key early priority for me is to make a decision on the way forward following the Government's recent consultation on high speed rail (HS2).

My Department received around 55,000 responses to the consultation and an analysis of them has been undertaken. I am being provided with detailed information on the issues raised. This will provide me with extensive evidence in respect of all the issues that will affect my decision.

A number of colleagues have understandably requested meetings regarding HS2 and I believe it is important that that there should be an opportunity for me to hear directly from MPs on their views about HS2. Given that the consultation has closed, due process means it would not be proper for me to respond to any substantive points that are made at this meeting.

I wish to place on record that I will be providing MPs with an opportunity for such a meeting. I have scheduled this meeting for 21 November and have written to all members to ask them if they wish to attend. The meeting will take place in the Palace of Westminster. In the interests of transparency, I will arrange for a transcript to be made available, as a public record of the proceedings.

  * to provide a robust challenge of the continuing need for this NDPB - both its functions and form; and,
  * if it is agreed that it should remain as an NDPB, to review the control and governance arrangements in place to ensure that the public body is complying with recognised principles of good corporate governance.

The Triennial Review will build upon the internal review of the body conducted earlier this year.

I will announce the findings of the review later this year in line with the decision on the response to the consultation on high speed rail.

That is something we can and must tackle. The recent review by Sir Roy McNulty found scope to cut rail costs by 30 per cent - up to £1bn a year. My department is committed to working with the rail industry to develop a strategy to deliver a better value railway for the benefit of passengers, taxpayers and the wider economy.

In furtherance of that strategy, my Department has undertaken to develop and publish detailed proposals on delivering a sustainable railway including reform of Network Rail. I am today announcing my intention to publish a Command Paper that sets out those proposals early next year.

It will allow time for greater consideration of other issues central to the question of rail reform. This will also allow the Command Paper to properly reflect the consequences of my decision following our consultation on a national high speed rail network.

As part of the development of a comprehensive strategy for rail, and alongside the Command Paper, I also plan to consult on the scope to devolve responsibility for some rail passenger services in parts of England to sub-national bodies, and on issues relating to the review of fares and ticketing announced in May. In addition, the ORR expects to consult later this year on possible changes to its role, particularly in respect of future franchises.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111121,Airport security scanners,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** On Christmas Day 2009 an attempted attack on Northwest flight 253 from Amsterdam Schiphol to Detroit was made using an explosive device concealed in the underwear of a passenger. The device had been constructed with the aim of making detection by existing screening methods extremely difficult and had not been picked up by airport security at any point throughout the passenger's journey.

The previous Government's response to this threat included introducing security scanners at UK airports. Security scanners were deployed at Heathrow and Manchester airports in February 2010. They were deployed at Gatwick airport a few months later, meaning that today scanners are in operation at three of the largest UK airports.

A public [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/2010-23)on an interim code of practice for the use of security scanners began just before the General Election. After the election, my predecessor, Philip Hammond, extended the consultation to allow more time for people to respond. The consultation closed on 19 July 2010 and over 6,000 responses were received. These have been analysed and I can now announce how we intend to deploy security scanners in the future.

The overwhelming feedback from airports is that nearly all passengers accept the use of security scanners and find the process quick and convenient. Out of over a million scans the Government is aware of only twelve refusals. However, I recognise that some passengers have concerns about the use of security scanners and these concerns were reflected in the responses to the consultation.

The ways in which security scanners can be deployed have been restricted by European legislation. My predecessor asked the Transport Commissioner to bring forward proposals which relax these restrictions, and allow scanners to be used more flexibly. An outline package which would achieve this was presented to the European Aviation Security Committee in July and has now been agreed by the European Parliament.

Most responses to the consultation expressed discomfort with the idea of having an image of their body captured for analysis, and they indicated that - if selected for a security scan - they would prefer to opt for an alternative method of screening. I have considered this carefully. However, I have decided against it, on security, operational and privacy grounds.

Firstly, I do not believe that a 'pat down' search is equivalent in security terms to a security scan. The purpose of introducing security scanners in the first place was to protect the travelling public better against sophisticated terrorist threats: these threats still exist and the required level of security is not achieved by permitting passengers to choose a less effective alternative.

I have considered carefully whether there are alternative screening methods which might deliver equivalent levels of security to a security scan. A full private search - involving the loosening and/or removal of clothing in the presence of security staff in a private room - would deliver a reasonable level of assurance. However, I believe that this is likely to represent a greater intrusion of privacy than a security scan, and that nearly all passengers, if they fully understand the procedures, would be unlikely to opt for this alternative. It is also likely to be operationally disruptive to airports and other passengers. Appropriately trained security staff would need to be diverted from the main search area to undertake these searches, leading to increased costs and longer queues for everyone else. I do not, therefore, believe that this represents a viable way forward.

I am aware that the proposals recently agreed by the European Parliament include the right for passengers to request an opt out from scanning. The UK did not support these proposals when they were presented to the Aviation Security Committee. Given the security arguments against permitting such an opt-out, and the threat level that exists in the UK, the Government intends to use its powers under the Aviation Security Act to maintain the current position. Those passengers selected for scanning will therefore not be able to fly if they are not willing to be scanned.

The consultation also asked people whether they had any health concerns relating to the small doses of ionising radiation produced by some security scanners. Only a limited number of responses were received on this issue, but I recognise that it has continued to be a contentious issue. Last year, experts from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) conducted an official assessment of the x-ray backscatter scanner in use at some UK airports. The HPA found that the dose of ionising radiation received from deployed backscatter scanners is the equivalent to that received naturally through just two minutes of flying at high altitude.
The European Commission has called for further expert consideration of the potential health risks from security scanners and has asked the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to review the evidence. I look forward to the Committee's report and will consider it carefully before making decisions about which technologies should be deployed at UK airports in future.

However, it is right that the Government does what it can to address people's concerns wherever that is possible without compromising security. Therefore I can announce today that the Government intends to make further improvements to the privacy and data safeguards already in place for security scanners.

Software which automatically analyses images is currently in development. Where this technology has developed to a stage at which it passes rigorous Government testing, airports will be expected to deploy it when they renew or replace their equipment. This will mean that in the future images will no longer be seen by human reviewers. In addition, airports will also be required to undertake routine testing of hardware and software to ensure that they remain unable to copy, save, or otherwise transmit images. This will be verified by the Department's transport security inspectors.

I have also been considering whether security scanners should be rolled out more widely at UK airports. In principle, I believe that they should. My officials will work with the aviation industry to agree a risk-based approach to further deployments. However, I want to make sure that this is done in conjunction with the availability of enhanced screening technology with better privacy safeguards. The precise timing of further deployments will therefore be dependent on how quickly the new generation of security scanners is developed.

I have placed a copy of this statement, and the revised regulations on the use of security scanners at UK airports, in the Libraries of both Houses.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111123,Civil Aviation Bill,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** The publication of the [draft Civil Aviation Bill](/publications/civil-aviation-bill) today marks an important step in this Government's desire to put passengers at the heart of airport operations. The proposals are designed to modernise key elements of the regulatory framework for civil aviation in the UK, to enable the sector to increase its contribution to economic growth without compromising high standards.

Much of our aviation regulation is governed by 1980s legislation and needs to be updated. This draft Bill offers a package of reforms to make both regulation and the sanctions which support it flexible, proportionate, targeted and effective. It proposes removing unnecessary regulation and unnecessary intervention by central government. It devolves more responsibility to the independent specialist regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), while ensuring that the CAA is accountable and weighs the costs and benefits of its decisions. The draft Bill proposes that certain costs of regulating aviation should be moved from general taxation to the aviation industry.

Above all the draft Bill puts the consumer first. In the economic regulation of airports with substantial market power the CAA's primary duty will be to consumers; that is passengers and owners of cargo now and in the future. In addition the Bill gives the CAA a role in promoting better public information about airline and airport performance and about the environmental effects of aviation and measures taken to mitigate adverse effects.

Aviation enables people to travel for business, leisure and to visit friends and family; and it enables the rapid movement of goods to and from markets overseas. The Government wants to see a successful and competitive aviation industry. We are taking forward the work of the South East Airports Taskforce to improve our major airports within the constraints of existing runways. In the longer term, we have committed to producing a sustainable framework for UK aviation by 2013 which supports economic growth and addresses aviation's environmental impacts.

The draft Bill complements these policies. It is in three parts:

  * reforming the framework for airport economic regulation, following my predecessor's statements to the House on 3 March 2011 and 21 July 2010.
  * modernising the framework and functions of the aviation regulator, the CAA. Some of these measures stem from the independent strategic review of the CAA by Sir Joseph Pilling in 2008 and a consultation launched by the previous Government in 2009.
  * transferring certain operational aviation security functions to the CAA as part of wider work to improve aviation security regulation and deliver savings to general taxation. This proposal, mentioned in the July 2011 consultation document ""Better Regulation for Aviation Security"", would create a single regulator for aviation safety and security. The Secretary of State would remain responsible for aviation security policy and issuing aviation security Directions to the industry.

The Government has previously announced that legislation to implement airport economic regulation reforms would be introduced early in the next Parliamentary session. An opportunity has now arisen to introduce a Civil Aviation Bill into Parliament near the beginning of 2012. This would help ensure that the CAA does not have to set airport price controls for the 5-year period 2014-2019 under the existing system. I therefore intend to take up this opportunity. I still wish however to publish the draft Bill today to provide an opportunity, even though the time available is shorter than previously envisaged, for the Transport Committee and stakeholders to consider the proposals before they are introduced into Parliament.

It is possible that the scope of the Bill may be extended before it is introduced. One area which could be included is the reform of the Air Travel Organisers' Licence (ATOL), following the recently finished consultation on measures to protect consumers better in the 21st century holiday market and help create a more level regulatory playing field for businesses.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111128,Search and rescue helicopters,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** I wish to inform the House of the Government's intentions for the future of the search and rescue helicopter service in the UK. Following the cancellation of the SAR-H Private Finance Initiative in February, the Department for Transport will today publish a [notice](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/uk-sar-helicopter-services) in the Official Journal of the European Union to commence procurement for a new UK wide service contract.

My Rt. Hon Friend the Defence Secretary has agreed that the new contract will provide a search and rescue capability provided by civilian crews, enabling our Armed Forces to focus activity on their front line operations.

The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force crews have shown great dedication and professionalism in delivering an exemplary search and rescue service for many years, and we owe them all great thanks for this. Looking forward, we are confident that, building on nearly 30 years of civilian service provided under contract to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), a fully civilian service will be able to maintain the same standards in the future.

This competition will procure a contracted search and rescue helicopter service for the whole of the UK, for a period of approximately 10 years. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy will continue to provide search and rescue coverage until the replacement for this capability is in place, and it is my intention that the contract I let will require this to be the first part of the new service to become operational. This will ensure that the Ministry of Defence is able to meet its previously announced intention to withdraw from service and retire its fleet of Sea King helicopters by March 2016. The replacement for the capability currently provided by the MCA will follow on from this. This transition will ensure continuity of service.

Bidders for the future service will be able to put forward options which will utilise a mixed fleet of modern helicopters based on the capabilities required at each of the bases (such as range, carrying capacity and endurance). The services will be capable of delivery by different contractors providing complementary services.

The introduction of a modern fleet of fast, reliable helicopters will lead to major improvements in the capability available from the present mix of helicopters. Modern helicopters operating from 10 full-time bases can not only continue to meet all current service requirements but also provide faster flying times to a large part of the UK search and rescue region, as well as providing a more reliable service. This will therefore be reflected in the new contract.

It is my intention that search and rescue operations will cease at RAF Boulmer in 2015 and at MCA Portland when the interim arrangements that were announced in July expire. Other operations at RAF Boulmer will be unaffected by this.

Given the complexity of the issues that need to be considered by bidders during the procurement, I intend that this procurement will be undertaken using the competitive dialogue procedure. As far as is practicable however, I intend to run the competition using lean procurement principles during some stages of the procurement. This will, I hope, both expedite and simplify some stages of the procurement that would ordinarily be time consuming and costly for industry to participate in.

I expect to award a contract in early 2013 to give the future service provider time to mobilise the new capability.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111129,Strategic Rail Freight Interchanges,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: I am delighted to make this statement together with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government about the importance of rail freight and the need for a network of [Strategic Rail Freight Interchanges](/publications/strategic-rail-freight-interchange) to support growth and create employment.

The UK logistics industry makes a significant contribution to the national economy, generating around £110 billion annually and employing more than two million people. The rail network transports over 100 million tonnes of goods per year. It is of strategic importance - rail freight delivers over a quarter of the containerised food, clothes and white goods, and delivers nearly all the coal for the nation's electricity generation. Rail freight has expanded by 60% over the last decade, and is expected to grow by a further 30% up to 2019.

Over recent years, rail freight has started to play an increasingly significant role in logistics and has become an important driver of economic growth. Given the right conditions, the Government believes that rail freight could make an even stronger contribution to the country's economic recovery.

The Government supports the transfer of freight from road to rail, where it is practical and economic to do so and fully recognises that rail freight can generate valuable benefits for society where it provides an alternative to road haulage. Rail can deliver goods quickly, efficiently and reliably and help reduce both congestion on our roads and levels of carbon emissions. To secure this longer-term growth and modal shift, rail needs to be able to compete effectively with the use of road by heavy goods vehicles, and it is significant that in recent years our major retailers have been keen to choose rail over road for the long distance carriage of goods to market.

However, this expansion in rail freight will be very difficult to deliver unless the industry is able to develop modern distribution centres linked into both the rail and trunk road system - 'Strategic Rail Freight Interchanges' (SRFI) - in appropriate locations to serve our major conurbations. To date, this has proved extremely problematical, especially in the South East where growing demand and increasing congestion on the road network are creating serious logistical challenges.

The Government believes that an expanded network of SRFIs, complemented by other freight interchanges and terminals, is needed to support longer-term development of efficient rail freight distribution logistics. Whilst SRFIs operate to serve regional and cross regional catchment areas, they are also key components in national and international networks. These networks are of strategic importance in facilitating links between UK regions and the European Union.

The Government is therefore taking measures to unblock the development of strategic rail freight interchanges and unlock the necessary private sector investment in such facilities. Pending the publication of the Department for Transport's consultation document on the National Networks National Policy Statement (NPS), a statement of current Strategic Rail Freight Interchange policy has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and published on the Department's website. It may be used by the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) in its decision making on the development consent applications for SRFI infrastructure that fall within the definition of a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) as defined in the Planning Act 2008.

In parallel, the Department has asked Network Rail to provide industry support to the development of a network of SRFIs, working collaboratively with the wider logistics industry to: speed up the delivery of SRFI sites to meet business demand; assist with funding mechanisms (potentially including Network Rail funding); and establish appropriate delivery vehicles for rail infrastructure elements of such proposals.

Evidence shows that ships with armed guards are less likely to be attacked and taken for ransom, and the House will be aware that the Prime Minister confirmed last month that the Government now recognises the use of private armed guards as an option to protect UK registered ships and their crews from acts of piracy.  This applies in exceptional circumstances as defined below:

  * when the ship is transiting the high seas throughout the High Risk Area (an area bounded by Suez and the Straights of Hormuz to the North, 10°S and 78°E); _and_
  * the latest ""Best Management Practices"" is being followed fully but, on its own, is not deemed by the shipping company and the ship's master as sufficient to protect against acts of piracy; _and_
  * the use of armed guards is assessed to reduce the risk to the lives and well being of those onboard the ship.

I am therefore today, publishing interim guidance to shipping companies on the use of armed guards onboard UK flagged ships.  This guidance covers, amongst other things, the factors to be included in the risk assessment, advice on selecting a private security company, and a requirement for the shipping company to produce a counter-piracy plan and submit a copy to my Department.

A private security company (PSC) employed to put armed guards onboard UK ships will require authorisation from the Home Office for possession of any prohibited firearms as defined in the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended). Checks will be carried out by the Home Office and Police into the PSC and its personnel before an authorisation is granted.

The guidance to shipping companies, and the Home Office process for authorising the possession of prohibited firearms, are both interim and will be reviewed within 12 months so that they reflect continuing national and international work to ensure high standards in the provision of armed guards in the maritime domain.

Since taking up office in October I have been considering the issues, raised as part of the consultation and additionally have listened to the views of Honourable Members. In order to ensure that my decision is based on a careful consideration of all relevant factors, I have concluded that I should allow myself until early in 2012 to announce my decisions. I am therefore notifying the House that I will not be making a further statement on the subject of high speed rail this year, but I expect to announce my decisions in January.

This marks the first major revision of these systems since the first Wilson government, and represents a major decentralisation of power. It will greatly improve the ability of local authorities to make changes on their roads, and greatly reduce the amount of central government resource needed to run the system.

Under the new system:

  * Local authorities will have control over roads classification decisions in their area, determining which roads should be 'A' roads, 'B' roads, etc.
  * Local authorities will be able to set the roads used by the Primary Route Network ('A' roads with green signs), while central government retains oversight of the whole system.
  * Central government will continue to look after the strategic road network.

For roads classification and the Primary Route Network, the Department for Transport will reduce its role to handling appeals cases and any disputes which might arise between local authorities, leaving local authorities to manage their roads in the manner they judge most effective.

As part of the consultation, we also took the opportunity to examine whether there might be better ways to link the management of the system with satnav technology. The Department will be taking this work forward, and will make a further statement in the new year.

I am therefore pleased to announce today a further £37.5m of ""mid-tier"" Access for All funding for projects requiring up to £1m of Government support.

This forms part of the wider £370m Access for All programme launched in 2006 which will deliver an accessible, step free route at 148 key stations. Rail passengers will benefit from better access through the provision of new lifts, ramps, raised ""easier access humps"" on platforms as well as new accessible toilets.

Major improvements will take place at stations across the country including at London Paddington, St. Austell, Stratford, Stratford-upon-Avon and Ystrad Mynach.  Network Rail will also receive funding to add tactile edge paving at 27 stations and  £5m to provide ""easy access humps"" to reduce the stepping distance between the platform and the train. The full list of successful stations will be made available on the Department for Transport's website.

All work at the stations will be completed by March 2014. We are also taking the opportunity to increase the funding allocated to train operating companies. This funding will increase from £5m a year to £7m a year for the next three years, beginning in April 2012. It is based on the number of stations that they manage and is used to deliver smaller scale or more locally focused access improvements at stations.

Finally, I have agreed to release £57m from the existing budget earlier than planned to allow the accelerated delivery of obstacle free routes at 27 stations.

The Presidency will be seeking a Political Agreement on a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a single European railway area (Recast). The European Parliament had its first reading of this proposal on 16 November. Many of the Parliament's amendments differed significantly from the Council's general approach text. Following discussion at the one Council working group meeting that took place following the first reading it is expected the Presidency will seek a political agreement, which incorporates only those amendments that do not alter the general approach, and thus will be acceptable to the UK.

The Council will be asked to reach a partial General Approach on a draft Regulation amending Regulation 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending regulation 561/2006. The UK supports elements of the proposal that aim to reduce burdens on business. I will want to resist provisions that might impose unnecessary burdens or additional costs on Government or Industry, including the proposal to ban operators from installing and calibrating tachographs in their own vehicles. I will be seeking to minimise the risks of increases in costs and burdens via future decisions taken by the European Commission ('the Commission') under a delegated or implementing act, by pressing for clearly specified constraints on the scope of proposed action.

The Council will be asked to reach a General Approach on a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers. Although we would question the merit of a European database of Seafarer Certification, we have negotiated important changes which would require the anonymisation of seafarer personal data to be a mandatory pre-condition of the obligation to transfer data. We have also negotiated changes to align the text more closely with the deadline for the implementation of the amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers to avoid placing additional burdens on EU Member States which would put our flags at a competitive disadvantage with other countries' flags.

The Council will be asked to reach a General Approach on a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers (Recast). The UK is in favour of the General Approach proposed for the draft recast of these regulations which brings European law in line with amendments agreed at the International Maritime Organization.

There will also be a Progress Report on a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Union guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network. The UK recognises that the TEN-T Network should be focused on projects that carry clear EU-added value and should be supported by guidelines on projects seeking EU funding. We do not support standards and requirements being expanded to the wider TEN-T Network on a mandatory basis. We believe that decisions on national projects to be prioritised for development and investment should remain with the Member States and the transport operators concerned. Furthermore, the UK is keen to ensure that this proposal does not impose any additional financial or administrative burdens.

The main items under Any Other Business include the Commission's presentation on its proposal for an Airport package, the Implementation and exploitation of European satellite navigation systems and the Connecting Europe Facility. The Commission will also provide information on the European Aviation Safety Management System and Air cargo security action plan.

The Polish Presidency will provide information on the Ministerial Conference on Eastern Partnership held in Krakow on 24-25 October 2011 and on the High Level Conference on the Implementation of the Single European Sky and its extension to third countries held in Warsaw on 28 November 2011.

The Danish delegation will also provide information on the work programme of their forthcoming Presidency of the EU.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20111207,Court notification of drink-drive offences,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** In conjunction with my Hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Justice, the Member for Huntingdon, I wish to inform the House of serious errors that have been identified in the way in which data on drink drive convictions is shared between the Police, Courts and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

At the end of last year, I asked the DVLA to review communication between the courts and the DVLA. As a result of these investigations it became clear that the alcohol levels for some drink driving convictions were either not provided to the DVLA by the courts, or were inconsistent when there was a delay between the court sending the information and the reconciliation of this information by DVLA. These errors have been happening for more than 20 years. As a result, in some cases, driving licences were reissued to individuals whose ban had expired, but without them undergoing legally required medical tests.

As soon as the problem was reported to me in August 2011, DVLA put in place manual checks so that any court notification received at DVLA without an alcohol reading was immediately investigated and no licences were re-issued without the alcohol level being provided. In addition, DVLA have worked to identify cases where information was incomplete in the backlog of data since 1991.

The Courts and DVLA are now implementing IT changes which will mean that their systems will not allow cases to be processed at either the Courts or DVLA unless valid alcohol readings are provided. Furthermore, new operational guidance has been issued to staff who deal with these cases.

Drivers convicted of drink driving offences with more than two and a half times the permitted legal alcohol limit are regarded as High Risk Offenders (HROs). The law requires that such convicted drivers are required to prove their medical fitness before they can be relicensed at the end of their disqualification period.

As a result of the review DVLA have undertaken, I was informed that some convicted drivers who should have been treated as HROs have been granted a driving licence at the end of their disqualification on the basis of their own declaration of health, without undertaking the required medical assessment.

In total, 265,225 driver records have been found to be missing the relevant information on alcohol levels. Correct alcohol levels have now been obtained for 50,330 of these. We have identified within this group 3,895 drivers who should have been treated as HROs - and therefore should have undergone a medical assessment - before being granted a licence following their disqualification. These drivers present a potential risk to road safety and are being contacted so that they can undergo a medical assessment immediately. Those who fail to comply, or cannot demonstrate their medical fitness to drive, will lose their entitlement to drive.

The Ministry of Justice, Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service, The Scottish Courts Services and the Police are working together urgently to identify the correct alcohol readings for a further 28,830 records. Any further HROs identified from these will also be required to undergo a medical assessment.

We have identified that of the 265,225 cases, some 53,028 relate to convicted drivers who have not yet applied to renew licences. These individuals do not therefore pose an immediate road safety risk. Their records have been blocked to ensure that if they do apply for a licence in future any identified as being HROs will have to undergo the medical assessment before a licence can be issued.

Records retention policy and the time limits set under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, means that it will not be possible to act upon the alcohol readings in the remaining 133,037 cases identified. We cannot therefore say how many of these drivers would have been HROs at the time of their conviction.

It is with great regret that I inform the House that we have identified two cases in 1996 and 2006 where a driver who was issued a licence without first proving their medical fitness to drive, has subsequently caused death while driving under the influence of alcohol. Every death on the road is a tragedy and we have the deepest sympathy for anyone affected by the actions of these drink drivers. It is not possible to say whether the drivers in these cases would have got their licences back following a medical examination. Every effort is being made to contact the victims' families to inform them and to ensure they receive full and proper support.

I can assure the House that we regard road safety and ensuring convicted drivers are treated correctly as of critical importance. Everything possible will be done to take action, where we are legally able, against those who represent a risk to other road users. The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Justice and I have ensured that immediate action has been taken to deal with this issue and to make sure it does not happen again. I must make clear that this investigation is continuing but due to the complexity of accessing very old court data, final figures will not be known for a number of months.

A new £50m Better Bus Area Fund will provide grants of up to £5m to a minimum of 10 local authorities working in partnership with local bus operators for them to spend in 2012-13. The aim of the fund is to increase bus patronage in busy urban areas, and the Department's aims of creating growth and cutting carbon.
Authorities wishing to bid for bus funding will be asked to submit bids in February to allow the Department to make awards by the end of March. Detailed bidding guidance will be placed on the departmental website shortly.

To support further the establishment and development of Community Transport, I am also making available £10m to be distributed to 76 local authorities in England, outside London, by formula; this is a repeat of the _Supporting Community Transport Fund_ announced in March 2011. Letters will be sent to eligible local authorities in the New Year, with details of the timing of payments. This comes on top of the £10 million distributed back in March 2011.

As well as these two new funds, last week the Chancellor announced £25m of funding for environmental improvement to buses. £20m of this will be available to bus operators to help them buy low-carbon emission buses through a further round of the Green Bus Fund, for which detail bidding guidance will be published shortly. The remaining £5m will allow older buses in London to be retrofitted with pollution-reducing equipment to help deliver air quality improvements in the capital. Together with additional funding from Transport for London, the total amount being committed is £10m. Not only should this deliver a step change in the environmental performance of buses in the capital, but it will help promote jobs across the UK in the companies that supply clean vehicle technology.

But times change and so do the needs of customers. To make sure the DVLA meets those changing needs, I am announcing today the launch of a consultation on a programme of work which will transform the way that the DVLA delivers its services to customers.

This programme will make it easier for motorists to carry out their business with the DVLA. This will be achieved by centralising services and providing much more choice and flexibility around how and when motorists deal with the DVLA. The proposals could deliver significant efficiencies with an estimated £28 million year on year saving.

As a result of these proposals I expect the DVLA to centralise services at its Swansea offices and to deliver those services electronically and in partnership with others. To this end, the DVLA will withdraw from its network of expensive, regionally located offices by the end of 2013. As this proposed centralisation of services is expected to have an impact on resources, the DVLA will now consult staff in these offices and the trade unions on the impact of the changes.

Also, motorists in Northern Ireland currently do not have access to all vehicle services that are available on the mainland, for example, the facility to tax a vehicle online is currently unavailable in NI. As part of this programme, the DVLA will also look to offer the full range of services to motorists in Northern Ireland.

The DVLA will ensure that the motor trade and customers are fully involved in the consultation on the transformation programme and that service delivery will not be adversely affected; rather, the expectation is that for many, services will be enhanced.

I am committed to improving the service all motorists receive while increasing efficiencies. I believe these changes will bring service improvements, better value for money and a faster, more responsive service for customers, while at the same time delivering greater productivity from the DVLA's workforce.

""The Petition of residents of Dartford and readers of the Dartford Messenger newspaper, declares that the Petitioners are opposed to any increase in tolls charged for the Dartford Crossing. The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Department for Transport not to increase tolls on the Dartford Crossing and to reconsider the emergency measures to lift the barriers during severe congestion and extend the local residents discount scheme. And the Petitioners remain, etc."" [P000960]

Regrettably, the 'Observations by the Secretary of State' published by the Department for Transport on 14 October were incorrect, and related to another petition. The observations should have been as follows:

The Government set out its intention to revise the road user charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing as part of the outcomes of the Government's 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2010.

Subject to consultation, the Government proposed increasing the levels of road user charges in 2011 and 2012, in order to continue the prioritisation of improvements to the Crossing in the short, medium and longer term. The improvements include the suspension of charges at the times when an emergency exists such as severe congestion, the implementation of new, free-flow, charging technology, and the review of options for additional crossing capacity.

The Department for Transport published for consultation the details of its proposed revisions to the road user charging regime on 30 June 2011 and the consultation period closed on 23 September 2011.

The Department recently announced that there will be no increase in charges in November 2011 or April 2012.

The Department is considering the responses made during the consultation, and will consider carefully all the representations made before making any announcements on its conclusions.

The Highways Agency began a six month trial of an operational charge suspension protocol in July 2011, and it will review the effectiveness of the trial following its conclusion in December 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111214,Funding decisions on local authority major transport schemes,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** Following the 2010 Spending Review the Government committed to a £1.5 billion programme of investment in major transport schemes promoted by local authorities, recognising the impact that such schemes can have on growth and the economy.

Our aim was to ensure that the programme of investment for the spending review period would be affordable, would promote growth and would achieve better value for money for the taxpayer. All local authority promoters with schemes already in the pipeline were challenged to improve their scheme design, reduce costs and secure a greater proportion of funding from local sources.

In February 2011 we confirmed funding for the first 9 of these schemes and announced an expanded Development Pool of 45 schemes that would be considered in more detail.

The local authority promoters of the Development Pool schemes were invited to submit revised funding bids in September 2011. Funding for 20 of these schemes was confirmed on 29 November as part of the Autumn Statement.

I am today announcing funding for a further 21 schemes as follows. These represent a mix of road and public transport schemes across England.

  * A684 Bedale-Aiskew-Leeming Bar Bypass
  * Bath Transportation Package
  * Beverley Integrated Transport Plan
  * Camborne-Pool-Redruth Transport Package
  * Chester Road (Birmingham)
  * Coventry-Nuneaton Rail Upgrade
  * Croxley Rail Link (Watford)
  * Darlaston (Walsall)
  * Elmbridge Transport (Gloucester)
  * Leeds Inner Relief Road Maintenance
  * Loughborough Town Centre Transport Scheme
  * Luton Town Centre Transport Scheme
  * Morpeth Northern Bypass
  * North Fringe to Hengrove BRT (Bristol)
  * Norwich Northern Distributor Road (NNDR)
  * Nottingham Ring Road
  * Pennine Reach (East Lancs Rapid Transit)
  * South Yorkshire Bus Rapid Transit Phase 1 (Sheffield/Rotherham)
  * Sunderland Strategic Corridor
  * Weston Package
  * Worcester Transport Strategy.

This is a major programme of investment. The schemes announced today will cost £854m with a DfT contribution of up to £586m in this spending review period and beyond. The total DfT contribution to all 41 schemes will be up to £972m, compared to the £1.575bn that was previously requested for these schemes prior to the spending review - a 38% reduction. This means that a far greater number of schemes can go ahead than would otherwise have been the case.

All the schemes announced will now be able to progress towards construction subject to securing any remaining necessary planning and statutory approvals and subject to confirmation of value for money where material changes to the scheme have been proposed.

We are not yet able to make decisions for a further four of the Development Pool schemes.

In two cases, we have not yet been provided with sufficient evidence to allow us to assess the schemes' value for money. These are the Leeds New Generation Transport (Trolleybus) and South Essex Rapid Transit schemes. In these cases the promoters will have until 31 March 2012 to provide the necessary additional information, and we will make decisions within two months of receipt.

The Waverley Link Road proposed by Rotherham Borough Council is opposed in its current form by Sheffield City Council, whose land is required for the proposed route. We recognise that there is a case for additional transport capacity in this area but the currently proposed scheme does not appear to be deliverable. We are inviting Rotherham to work with Sheffield and other stakeholders and to propose a resolution to the issue by 31 March 2012.

We recognise the critically important role that transport improvements could play in the regeneration of the Bexhill-Hastings area and the economic case underpinning the Bexhill-Hastings Link Road, though we are also aware of concerns regarding the proposed scheme, including its environmental impact.

Before we take a final decision on the scheme we want to be sure that it offers the best approach for regenerating the area and also to consider other transport options to achieve this, including local trunk roads such as the A21, A259 and local rail. We also want to consider whether further environmental mitigation measures could be deployed to address the impacts of the proposed Bexhill-Hastings scheme.

Over the next three months the Department will work alongside the scheme's promoters and other local and regional partners to gather further evidence on the optimal solution for the area. We would intend to make a decision swiftly thereafter.

Details of each of the schemes and the funding offered by the Government are available on the DfT website and will be followed by a more detailed document setting out the details of our decision making process, and information on our assessment of the schemes.

Within the Road Transport Red Tape Challenge, my department put forward every secondary regulation relating to road transportation for public discussion - 415 in total. 376 of these are judged still to be live, and of these I propose to scrap, merge, simplify, amend or improve 142 - well over a third.

Amongst the measures we are pursuing, we will be:

  * Scrapping the regulation requiring motorists to hold a paper counterpart to their driving licence by 2015 - saving drivers up to £8m;
  * Improving the regulation surrounding the notification process for vehicles that are not in use on the road (Statutory Off Road Notification or SORN). Once drivers have notified the DVLA that their vehicle is SORN, they will no longer have the burden of annual SORN renewal;
  * Only issuing hard-copies of V5C vehicle registration certificates for fleet operators when needed (with the potential to offer the same to private motorists);
  * Introducing a limited exemption from drivers' hours rules so that those who also drive as Territorial Army reservists in their own time can continue to do so.

The Challenge has also considered various administrative measures that are not based in legislation and has examined pieces of primary legislation that can be amended or simplified.

Other proposals include:

  * Removing the need for an insurance certificate. The Department for Transport will work with the insurance industry on removing the need for motorists to have to hold an insurance certificate.
  * Abolishing the requirement for drivers to prove they have insurance when applying for tax, meaning 600,000 more people will be able to tax their car online. This has been made possible by new checks of existing databases for insurance under new Continuous Insurance Enforcement rules. (The DVLA's records are now compared regularly with the Motor Insurance Database (MID) to identify registered keepers of vehicles that appear to have no insurance).
  * We will look at experience in other countries on driver Certificates of Professional Competence (CPC) - the qualification for professional bus, coach and lorry drivers. In particular, to see if we could remove the need for some sectors, such as farmers who drive stock to market, from needing a CPC.
  * Local Authorities will now have to ensure business interests are properly considered as part of any future proposed Workplace Parking Levy scheme. They must show they have properly and effectively consulted local businesses, have addressed any proper concerns raised and secured support from the local business community.
  * Abolishing the regulations on the treatment of lost property on buses. Bus companies currently have to wait 48 hours before they can throw away perishable items left on the bus.

The full list of 376 regulations, explaining what actions we are taking on each, is available on my Department's website at [http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/gov-20110520](/consultations/gov-20110520).

Overall, this represents an ambitious programme of deregulation, some elements of which will represent a major shift in the way my Department does business. I am pleased with the results of this section of the Red Tape Challenge and the deregulatory mindset it has helped foster. I look forward to similar outcomes from the ongoing rail and maritime theme and next year's examination of aviation red tape.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20111215,EU Transport Council,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: I attended the second Transport Council of the Polish Presidency in Brussels on 12 December.

The Council reached Political Agreement on a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a **single European railway area (Recast)**. At its first reading of the proposal on 16 November the European Parliament made amendments which differed significantly from the Council's general approach adopted at the June Transport Council. However, the Political Agreement text only incorporates those amendments that do not alter the general approach, and are acceptable to the UK. The Commission hopes a 2nd Reading deal can be struck with the European Parliament under the Danish Presidency.

The Council agreed a partial General Approach on a draft Regulation amending Regulation 3821/85 on **recording equipment in road transport**. This proposal would amend the specification for tachographs, which measure hours spent at the wheel by commercial lorry and bus drivers.

The Council also agreed a General Approach on:

  * a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the **minimum level of training of seafarers** to bring the Extant Directive into line with the latest International Maritime Organization rules; and
  * a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the **accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers (Recast)**. The amendments reflect changes to the international regime for tankers adopted at the International Maritime Organization between 2002 and 2009.

The Council noted a Progress Report on a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Union **guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network**. This item generated substantial discussion. I intervened to acknowledge the importance of good cross-border infrastructure for the single market, but expressed concern about binding obligations proposed and the financial and administrative burdens they would place on member states at a time when fiscal constraints are substantial and also stressed the need for member states' to retain their responsibility for planning decisions, processes and implementation. On the proposed increase to the TEN-T budget I said budgetary restraint must be the priority.

Under Any Other Business, the Commission presented its new proposals on a '**Better Airport package**' which cover a recast of the slot allocation Regulation, and revisions to the current Directives on ground handling and noise which are intended to address issues of capacity, growth, environmental concerns and competitiveness. The proposals on ground handling and noise have been recast as (directly applicable) Regulations.

The Commission reported on the **European Aviation Safety Management System** and **Air cargo security action plan**. I intervened in strong support of the European Aviation Safety Management System and to request that the Commission report back on progress at a future transport.

The Commission, at the request of Finland, reported on the current state of play with regards to the **aviation EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)**. There had been three main developments since the June Transport Council: the US House of Representatives had approved a Bill that would prohibit US airlines from complying with ETS; there had been political messages against ETS emerging from the ICAO Council in November; and President Obama had specifically raised the issue at the EU/US summit on 28 November, noting the need to avoid confrontation. The Commission's assessment was that while international opposition was strong, so was the EU response. The Commission acknowledged there still could be a challenge in ICAO under the Chicago Convention, and that it was important to understand what forms retaliatory action could take. Following a legal challenge from the US Air Transport Association and 3 US airlines the European Court of Justice will deliver its judgement on the case on 21 December.

Antonio Tajani, Commissioner responsible for Industry and Entrepreneurship, updated Ministers on recent developments within the **Galileo programme** and indicated that since the successful launch of the first two satellites in October the system was now up and running with real momentum behind it. The Commission also presented their proposed regulation on Galileo Governance and Exploitation.

Before the Council, I met Ministers from Finland, and Ireland, the German State Secretary, and the Northern Irish Transport Minister to discuss items on the Transport Council agenda, in particular TEN-T. In a separate discussion after Transport Council, I exchanged views on TEN-T and **better regulation** with the Siim Kallas, the Transport Commissioner.

The UK did not participate in the vote on one item on the A point list, namely Article 81 based Council Decision authorising the EU to accede to the 2002 Protocol to the **Athens Convention** relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea. The UK has however subsequently notified its intention to opt-in to the Council Decision.

The Danish delegation presented the work programme of their forthcoming Presidency of the EU. The incoming Danish Presidency's overarching aim in the transport sector will be ""green growth"" and they will take forward work on current Council dossiers. For example, they will be seeking to reach a 2nd reading agreement with the European Parliament on the recast of the first railway package. They will also commence work on proposals included in the recently published Commission work programme such as the airport package and the proposals on driving licences and the satellite navigation programmes as well as on an expected proposal on enforcement of the maritime labour convention. Their main priorities are the TEN-T guidelines and the airport package, especially ground handling and noise reduction proposals.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120110,High speed rail,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport."," **The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: The consultation High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future was one of the largest national consultations ever undertaken by the Department for Transport. 54,909 responses were received, from individuals, businesses and organisations across the country. It is clear from the consultation that a national high speed rail network - High Speed 2 - generates strong feelings, both in favour and against the scheme.

Since becoming Secretary of State for Transport I have taken time to consider all aspects of the consultation proposals and the evidence arising from both consultation responses and further work undertaken or commissioned by my Department and HS2 Ltd. This statement summarises my decisions.

I have decided Britain should embark upon the most significant transport infrastructure project since the building of the motorways by supporting the development and delivery of a new national high speed rail network. By following in the footsteps of the 19th century railway pioneers, the Government is signalling its commitment to providing 21st century infrastructure and connections - laying the groundwork for long-term, sustainable economic growth.

High Speed 2 (HS2) is a scheme to deliver hugely enhanced rail capacity and connectivity between Britain's major conurbations. It is the largest transport infrastructure investment in the UK for a generation, and, with the exception of High Speed 1 (HS1), is the first major new railway line since the Victorian era.

The HS2 Y network will provide direct, high capacity, high speed links between London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, with intermediate stations in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire. There will also be direct links to Heathrow Airport and to the Continent via the HS1 line. It will form a foundation for a potentially wider high speed network in years to come.

HS2 will be built in two phases to ensure that the benefits of high speed rail are realised at the earliest possible opportunity. The line from London to the West Midlands and the connection to HS1 are expected to open in 2026, followed, in 2032-33, by the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds and the connection to Heathrow. The capital cost at 2011 prices of building the complete Y network is £32.7 billion. At present values, it will generate benefits of up to £47 billion and fare revenues of up to £34 billion over a 60-year period.

The benefits of HS2 will extend beyond the network itself; links to current lines will enable direct trains to run to cities such as Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh and, with long-distance services transferring to the new network, space will be freed up for new commuter, regional and freight services on other lines, opening up new opportunities for Britain's existing railways. Links to key urban transport networks, such as Crossrail, will help to spread the benefits further still.

HS2 is entirely consistent with the Government's objectives for carbon emissions. Electrified rail is a comparatively low-carbon mode of transport, especially with the continued decarbonisation of the grid. Speed increases power consumption, but also makes HS2 more attractive to those currently flying or driving. The faster journeys on HS2 - Edinburgh and Glasgow will be just 3.5 hours from London - could transfer around 4.5 million journeys per year who might otherwise have travelled by air and 9 million from the roads. HS2 will also create more rail capacity on existing conventional speed lines for freight - removing lorries from our busy trunk roads. HS2 is therefore an important part of transport's low-carbon future.

In securing these benefits for our country, I am committed to developing a network with the lowest feasible impacts on local communities and the natural environment. I have been mindful that we must safeguard the natural environment as far as possible, both for the benefit of those enjoying our beautiful countryside today and for future generations.

People living along the line of route highlighted particular concerns and provided constructive and thoughtful comments about the London to West Midlands route proposed at consultation. Following careful study by my engineers I can announce a package of alterations to further reduce the route's impacts. The changes mean that more than half the route will now be mitigated by tunnel or cutting and there will also be a reduction in the impacts on people and communities, ancient woodlands and important heritage sites.

The changes include:

 * A longer, continuous tunnel from Little Missenden to the M25 through the Chilterns;
 * A new 2.75 mile (4.4 km) bored tunnel along the Northolt Corridor to entirely avoid major works to the Chilterns Line and impacts on local communities in the Ruislip area;
 * A longer green tunnel past Chipping Warden and Aston Le Walls, and to curve the route to avoid a cluster of important heritage sites around Edgcote; and,
 * A longer green tunnel to significantly reduce impacts around Wendover, and an extension to the green tunnel at South Heath.

The revised route offers considerable improvements to communities, with the number of dwellings at risk of land take almost halving and the number experiencing increased noise levels reducing by a third. Despite these improvements to limit the negative impacts of the line, HS2 will inevitably affect some homeowners, communities and businesses. To help those affected, we will bring in a package of measures, which are over and above what affected homeowners are already entitled to under law. These include:

 * A streamlined purchase scheme to simplify the statutory blight process for property owners;
 * A sale and rent back scheme to give homeowners within the safeguarded area more flexibility;
 * A streamlined small claims scheme for construction damage which will allow individuals and businesses who are entitled to compensation under existing law to claim it more quickly and simply;
 * A package of measures to reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels. Homeowners will be offered before and after surveys, a thorough assessment of the impact of similar tunnels, an explanation of the measures that will be taken to prevent perceptible vibration impacts, financial compensation for the compulsory purchase of subsoil, and a legally binding promise that HS2 will be permanently responsible for resolving any related settlement or subsidence issues; and,
 * A refreshed hardship-based property purchase scheme.

Finally, we will work constructively with local authorities along the line of route to minimise the negative consequences of HS2 and maximise the benefits.

In November I announced the Triennial Review of HS2 Ltd, and in making my decision I have accepted the finding that HS2 Ltd is the appropriate body to continue undertaking this work.

Today I have presented to Parliament a full account of my decisions titled High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future - decisions and next steps. My Department has published a series of supporting documents which set out in further detail the basis on which I have reached my decisions. All of this material is available at [www.dft.gov.uk/highspeedrail](/topics/high-speed-rail).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120110,Blue Badge Improvement Service,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am today providing an update on implementation of the Blue Badge reform programme that I announced in February 2011.

One of the key reforms to the Blue Badge scheme is the Blue Badge Improvement Service. This service has been developed in close consultation with disabled people and local authorities. It is a major initiative aimed at tackling rising levels of badge fraud and abuse, helping to ensure that disabled people receive improved customer service and ensuring that the scheme remains sustainable in the long term for those who rely on it most.

The Blue Badge Improvement Service became operational on 1 January 2012. I am pleased to say that every local authority in England has signed up to use the service and I would like to thank them all for their support in helping to deliver important and necessary changes that are vital for the future sustainable operation of the Blue Badge scheme. The Service should also help them to realise efficiency savings of up to £20m per year.

In an innovative move by the Department for Transport, the capital costs of the service are being met through private sector investment from Northgate Information Solutions who will deliver the secure web-based service, and Payne Security who will print, supply and distribute the newly designed badge.

The service establishes a common store of key information on badges and badge holders that will enable verification checks to be made quickly and easily.

To counter fraud, the design of the Blue Badge was changed in Regulations that came into force on 1 December 2011. The old-style cardboard badges have been replaced by new ones made from a fused and bonded hard plastic material and which contain a number of overt and covert security features.

For the first time, people can now apply for a Blue Badge using a national system that is available on Directgov. This should result in a quicker turnaround time for people re-applying for badges whose circumstances are not going to change. Those who use the online application form will only be asked to complete those sections that are relevant to the eligibility under which they are applying. They can also sign up for text and email reminders at re-application time, track the progress of their application and there will be an eligibility checker for those who want to find out if they are eligible for a badge. From 1 April 2012, badge holders will be able to report lost and stolen badges and update changes to their details online.

There is a new national helpline for general enquiries about Blue Badges that will signpost callers to the relevant local authority. However, local authorities will still be in charge of administering the Blue Badge scheme, making decisions about whether applicants are eligible and issuing badges.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120110a,High Speed Rail 2,"Oral statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.

","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: This morning, I made a written statement to the House announcing my decision to give the go-ahead to High Speed 2-a national high-speed rail network. With the exception of High Speed 1-a 68-mile stretch of line-it will be the first major national railway line to be built in Britain since the Grand Central line opened to passengers in 1899. I would like to provide Members with further detail of the substance of, and rationale for, my decisions.

I weighed up the evidence after one of the largest public consultations in our history. We wrote to more than 172,000 people living or working near the proposed line from London to the west midlands, visited communities along the 140-mile route and held 41 days of roadshows attended by almost 30,000 people over the five-month consultation period. Almost 55,000 responses were received from individuals, businesses and organisations across the country representing a wide spectrum of views. Many of those views were expressed strongly both in favour of and against high-speed rail, and I have considered them carefully in making my decisions.

Since becoming Secretary of State for Transport, I have examined all the available evidence, including the work undertaken by my right hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr Hammond) and by the previous Labour Administration in developing the consultation proposals, the evidence submitted during the consultation, and the further work undertaken by my Department and HS2 Ltd. My decision had to consider not only the full environmental impact of HS2 but its benefits to our economy, jobs and our competitiveness not just today but decades into the future.

I also had to be clear about the implications of not investing in high-speed rail-about how it would affect our leading cities, and how that would affect the road network and aviation. Generating growth, helping people back to work and supporting Britain's companies and wealth creators so that they can compete and win in the global marketplace are at the top of the Government's priority list, and, from day one in office, the coalition has had a laser focus on investing in and modernising our country's transport infrastructure with unprecedented levels of investment.

When it came to HS2, I could have made the easy choice: I could have gone for the short-term option, relying on a patch-and-mend approach and leaving our rail networks overstretched, overburdened and less resilient. But let us be clear: the price for that would have been paid in lost business, lower growth, fewer jobs and more misery for passengers on a network without the capacity to cope. We would have failed future generations depending on us to create the prosperous country that they will want to live in.

Good government is about acting in the long-term national interest and about taking decisions, however difficult, to improve people's quality of life and the country's economic prospects not just for the next four or five years but for the next four or five decades. Our Victorian predecessors would have been immensely proud to see their railways providing massive benefit today --more than 100 years later--but as a result of today's announcement the railway revolution that they started is happening again. We are ready for a new chapter in Britain's transport history--one designed to boost our economy and our country just as the first coming of the railways or the motorways did for previous generations.

That is why I have given the green light to HS2. In spite of the challenges of rising demand, our railways have been a huge success since privatisation. Passenger demand is growing year on year, particularly in the inter-city market. I recognise, however, that further rounds of upgrades to our major north-south lines, even if they offer apparently good value for money, can only provide a short-term fix-one that is incapable of meeting the long-term challenge. In truth, they could add only limited further capacity; they could not offer the step change in performance that passengers wish and need to see.

What is more, upgrades would consign rail passengers and the vitally important rail freight industry to years, if not decades, of future engineering disruption, delay and unreliability-something that users of the west coast main line will remember only too well. The question, therefore, is not, ""Do we build new lines?"" but, ""What type of line should we build?"" And when we weigh up the economic and social rewards, there is only one answer: high-speed rail. A high-speed line will deliver £6.2 billion more in benefits to the country than a line running at conventional speeds, at an extra cost of only £1.4 billion. Therefore, by slashing journey times, as well as providing the step change in rail capacity that we need to keep the country moving, a high-speed line will give a return on the additional investment of more than four to one. A modern, reliable and fast service between our major cities and international gateways, as befitting the 21st century, will transform the way we travel, and promote Britain's economic and social prosperity.

HS2 will be built in two phases, to ensure delivery of its benefits at the earliest possible opportunity. Phase 1 will link London to the west midlands, as well as delivering a direct connection to the continent through the channel tunnel via High Speed 1. Even in the first phase, cities and towns off the HS2 network-such as Stockport, Warrington, Liverpool, Preston and Glasgow-will be served by trains able to use both HS2 and inter-city lines, saving over half an hour on journeys to London. Phase 2 will provide onward legs to Manchester and Leeds, with intermediate stations in the east midlands and South Yorkshire, plus a direct connection to our international hub, Heathrow airport. HS2 will also mean substantial time savings between Britain's cities, reducing Birmingham-to-Leeds journeys from two hours to just 57 minutes, and Manchester-to-London journeys from two hours eight minutes to only one hour eight minutes. Edinburgh and Glasgow will benefit from a three-and-a-half hour journey time from London, encouraging modal shift from short-haul flights to high-speed rail.

In delivering HS2, I look forward to working with the Scottish Government and others to identify and evaluate options for developing the high-speed network and further reducing journey times. However, I want to emphasise to the House that in making my decisions, I have been particularly mindful of our responsibility to safeguard the countryside and its wildlife, and to protect local communities as far as possible. I have worked hard to look at more tunnelling, to lower the route into cutting to reduce visibility, and to move the route away from homes wherever viable. I have looked hard at how we can better protect our landscape, our wildlife and our heritage. For that reason, my engineers have carefully re-examined the route in the light of all the evidence. I can therefore announce a package of alterations that I believe will significantly reduce the railway's impact.

Those improvements include a longer, continuous tunnel under the Chilterns from Little Missenden to the M25, and a new 2.75-mile bored tunnel along the Northolt corridor to avoid major works to the Chiltern line and impacts on local communities in the Ruislip area. Of the 13 miles through the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty, less than 2 miles will be at or above the surface. The rest will be in deep cutting or tunnel. There will also be a longer green tunnel past Chipping Warden and Aston le Walls, and another longer green tunnel to reduce impacts around Wendover, as well as an extension to the green tunnel at South Heath. There will also be a green tunnel past Greatworth. Those are just a few examples from the suite of improvements detailed in full in the Command Paper that I presented to the House this morning.

The changes will bring significant benefits to communities and the environment. Compared with the consultation route, there will be a more than 50% increase in tunnel or green tunnel, now totalling around 22.5 miles. In addition, around 56.5 miles will be partially or totally hidden in cutting, as a key way of helping to reduce noise in neighbouring communities, and 10 miles less track along viaduct or embankment. In all, that means that around 79 miles--more than half the route--will be mitigated by tunnel or cutting. The revised tunnel alignment through the Chilterns will avoid an important water aquifier--[Hon. Members: ""Aquifer.""]--aquifer--significantly reducing impacts on water. You see, Mr Speaker, I am always happy to listen to people when they see a better way of doing things.

There will also be a reduction in the impacts on ancient woodlands and heritage sites. Communities affected will benefit from the changes, with a near 50 % reduction in the number of dwellings at risk of land take, and the number of households experiencing noticeably increased noise levels reducing by a third, to just over 3,000 properties.

I have always been clear in my mind, however, that, whatever the mitigation measures, there can be little comfort to someone in knowing that the country will benefit enormously from HS2 when it is their house, or their business, that has to be knocked down to make way for it. The meeting that I had with MPs earlier last year allowed many of those representing communities along the proposed route to communicate the views of their constituents to me directly.

So, to help people, we will bring in a package of compensation measures over and above those that affected homeowners are already entitled to under law. These include: a streamlined purchase scheme to simplify the statutory blight process for property owners; a sale and rent back scheme to give homeowners within the safeguarded area more flexibility; a streamlined small claims scheme for any construction damage; and a package of measures to reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels.

Homeowners will be offered before and after surveys, a thorough assessment of the impact of similar tunnels, an explanation of the measures that will be taken to prevent perceptible vibration impacts, financial compensation for the compulsory purchase of subsoil, and a legally binding promise that HS2 will be permanently responsible for resolving any related settlement or subsidence issues. There will be also be a refreshed hardship-based property purchase scheme, and, finally, we will work constructively, and in a structured way, with local authorities along the line of route to minimise the negative consequences of HS2 and maximise the benefits.

Having made the decision to press on with HS2, my intention is to drive it forward as fast as is practicable, so that we can gain from its benefits as early as possible and end the unwelcome uncertainty for those affected. A key part of this will be to engage fully and actively with organisations, communities and individuals along the whole route of the Y network. People presented legitimate concerns in the consultation and, even though we have made significant improvements, I am keen to work hard with local communities so that as many concerns as possible are properly addressed.

I have instructed HS2 Ltd to undertake a range of activities to prepare for and deliver both phases of the network. It is my intention to introduce a hybrid Bill in the House by the end of 2013, including a detailed environmental impact assessment to provide the necessary powers to construct and operate the line from London to Birmingham. I have instructed HS2 Ltd to deliver this project at pace, but within milestones that will stand the test of time and with regular reporting to me on progress. The Major Projects Authority, which this Government launched last March to improve the performance of major Government projects in delivering on time and in budget, will provide critical support and oversight.

This spring, we will consult on the draft directions for safeguarding the proposed route from London to the west midlands, as well as separately consulting on detailed compensation proposals. I aim to bring final safeguarding directions and an agreed compensation policy into effect later in the year. In March this year, HS2 Ltd will advise me on the route and station options to Manchester and Leeds, and in autumn 2012, we will start an engagement programme on a preferred route to discuss local views.

I warmly welcome the political consensus on HS2, on the basis that it will help to ensure that the planning and construction of this transformational scheme are carried through to completion. HS2 matters to the long-term success and prosperity of the whole of Britain. It will help to create jobs, support growth and regenerate our regions. It will better connect communities and improve people's opportunities, and, with its potential to attract people and freight on to trains and away from long-distance road journeys and short-haul flying, combined with the increasing decarbonisation of the grid, HS2 will be an important part of transport's low-carbon future.

Britain has faced such challenges before. The Victorian railway pioneers had the vision to build a rail network that has promoted growth and created jobs for more than a century. Those innovators transformed this country's fortunes. Our industries flourished, our exports multiplied, and our economy grew wealthy. Half a century later, another generation had the vision to start building the motorway network. Post-war planners developed the motorway network, connecting major cities and transforming the capacity of our road network. Half a century on again, we now need to do for our Victorian railway what previous generations did for our road network. The time has come again to seize the moment, to be ambitious and to show the world that this is a can-do country. The lesson from history--and the lessons from our global competitors--is that no matter how hard times are, we cannot stop planning for the future or investing in our infrastructure if we want Britain to flourish. HS2 will be the backbone of a new transport system for the 21st century, offering the vital capacity that we need to compete and grow as a country. It will transform the economic shape and balance of our country, linking our major cities to a level previous generations could only dream of. By backing HS2, this Government are backing Britain, and I commend this statement to the House.

The consultation was launched on 5th January 2010 in conjunction with a related consultation on Electric Personal Vehicles (EPVs) and ran until 30 March 2010. The EAPC Regulations were also included within the 'Retail' and 'Road Transportation' themes of the 'Red Tape Challenge' which ran from April 7th to June 17th 2011.

The Department has considered the responses and supports recommendations to harmonise power limits (from 200 Watts to 250 Watts) with similar provisions in place across the EU - allowing consumers access to a wider range of electrically assisted cycles.

Regulatory proposals will be developed to update power limits and consider other amendments, for example on weight limits, once EU discussions on a much wider group of 2, 3 and light 4-wheeled vehicles conclude. The outcome of EU discussions could have implications for the regulation of EAPCs, and it would therefore be unhelpful to make amendments at this time which might need to be subsequently repealed.

Spend for the period 1 April 2010 - 31 March 2011 was £3.8m. This includes £0.7m of spend during the previous administration. In 2009-10 the spend was £6.7m. This represents a 44% reduction in the amount departments spent on the ministerial car service compared to the previous financial year.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120117,Plug-in car grant extended to vans,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am pleased to announce the launch of a Plug-In Van Grant alongside the continuation of the existing Plug-In Car Grant to help stimulate the market for ultra-low emission vehicles. The Plug-In Van Grant, available to both private and business buyers across the UK, will provide a point of purchase discount of 20%, up to a maximum value of £8,000, for the purchase of eligible new ultra-low emission vans1.

Minister of State for Business and Innovation Mark Prisk and I have reviewed the existing Plug-In Car Grant, which provides a discount of 25%, up to £5,000 off the price of eligible ultra-low emission cars. We examined the need for and value of the grant, as well as its scope. We have concluded that there remains a strong case for the grant. We have therefore decided to continue with the Plug-In Car Grant at the current level, with provision out to 2015.

In addition, we are persuaded that there is a strong case for supporting ultra-low emission technology in vans - which often have fixed duty cycles and return to base regularly where they can easily recharge. An upfront purchase grant, when combined with the lower running costs and tax benefits, can make switching to an ultra-low emission van an attractive choice for businesses. The Plug-In Van Grant, alongside the existing Plug-In Car Grant, is designed to help private individuals and businesses adopt new, cleaner technology. Businesses, especially those with fleets, will be a key driver in increasing the market share of ultra-low emission vehicles.

The shift towards clean technology is an opportunity to further reinvigorate the UK automotive industry, where many van manufacturers are based, alongside helping to increase our energy security. The Plug-In Van Grant will help to improve local air quality in our cities, reduce carbon emissions and meet Government targets. The technology fits well with a large portion of the van market that relies on short urban trips to and from base.'

Only [vans which meet strict performance criteria for range, tail-pipe emissions and safety will be eligible](/topics/sustainable/olev/plug-in-van-grant/) for the Plug-In Van Grant. We are today opening the application process and inviting van manufacturers to apply for their vehicles to become part of the scheme. Applications can be received at any time. I expect to confirm shortly the first vans to join the scheme, for which applications will need to be received by 31 January.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20120117,Civil Aviation Authority environmental objectives,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","## Updating the 2002 guidance to the Civil Aviation Authority on environmental objectives relating to the exercise of its air navigation functions

**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** When the CAA is exercising its air navigation functions it is required under the Transport Act 2000 to take account of environmental Guidance given to it by the Secretary of State.  The current Guidance was issued in 2002 by the then Department for Transport, Local Government and Regions.

The CAA has been able to take account of the Guidance to make decisions on over 70 proposals for airspace change over the last nine years.  The Guidance recommends that the CAA keeps abreast of current Government policy including on planning, sustainable development and noise as well as guidance issued by the devolved administrations.

Given the length of time since the Guidance was published, and the recommendations of Sir Joseph Pilling in his July 2008 strategic review of the CAA and the Transport Select Committee in its 2009 report on the Use of Airspace, the Government recognises the need to update the Guidance to reflect current Government policy, including on issues such as noise and climate change.  This will be done next year following development of the _Sustainable Framework for UK Aviation_ and will include a public consultation so that all views can be heard on this important subject.

In the interim the Department for Transport is publishing today a technical addendum to the Guidance.  The addendum updates references and lists relevant policy documents and legislation published since 2002 that the CAA takes into account when considering airspace change proposals.

The consultation included proposals that would require new primary legislation to help bring greater clarity and coherence to holiday protection.

Following the consultation and after careful consideration of the responses, I am pleased to announce that the [Civil Aviation Bill introduced today](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/civilaviation.html) includes a clause that would widen the Secretary of State's powers so that holidays sold by airlines or arranged on an 'agent for the consumer' basis could be included in the ATOL scheme in the future. The Government's intention is that such a step would only be taken following full consultation with stakeholders including an impact assessment.

The Government intends to make a further statement on the full range of proposals for ATOL reform, shortly.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-2012012,InterCity West Coast rail franchise,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** In May last year, the then Secretary of State announced that the next InterCity West Coast franchise would start on 9th December 2012.

The Department for Transport has today published an Invitation to Tender to mark the commencement of the formal bidding stage of the competition to replace the current operator on the West Coast Main Line. The new franchise will continue through to March 2026, this date being aligned to the introduction of High Speed services along the proposed HS2 route.

  * [InterCity West Coast franchise](/publications/rail-passenger-franchise-intercity-west-coast)

Increasing capacity and tackling overcrowding is our priority. 106 extra 'Pendolino' carriages are being provided for the West Coast. In addition to the 45% increase in capacity delivered in December 2008, 31 existing Pendolinos are being lengthened from 9 to 11 carriages and 4 new trains are being introduced, increasing the number of standard class seats on each train by almost 50%, from 320 to 470.

In all, the 106 new carriages will make 28,000 extra seats available each day, an increase of 25%. We expect that the additional and lengthened trains will be targeted on those routes and times of day with the highest demand.

It was further announced in May that a consultation would take place on a revised Train Service Requirement (TSR). A summary of and response to this consultation has also been published today on the Department for Transport website.

The TSR has been designed to give bidders greater flexibility to respond to passenger demand and run their businesses in a more commercial way within a framework set by the franchise that protects key outcomes for passengers, taxpayers and the economy. The TSR requires the provision of the same number of weekly stops at each station as set out in the current franchise; but will allow the franchisee to vary the capacity provided on individual days of the week in order to cater for the variations in daily demand.

The ITT contains less specification than in previous competitions, with a stronger focus on outcomes, for example on passenger satisfaction, rather than detailed prescriptive inputs. We expect the additional flexibility set out in the ITT to enable bidders to provide both a better service for passengers and an improved financial return for taxpayers.

However we will continue to specify core requirements and to manage overall compliance of key deliverables, such as performance and service quality. The franchise will contain new obligations based around passenger satisfaction with stations, trains and customer services.

The franchise length of up to 15 years including an option to extend by 20 months is intended to encourage the development of long term relationships between the operator and stakeholders giving greater scope to challenge and reduce excessive industry costs. We also expect the certainty provided by a long franchise to encourage investment in assets such as stations, by extending the period over which commercially attractive schemes can pay back. The new franchisee will take over full repairing responsibilities for the 17 stations they manage. We believe that cost savings can be achieved through combining roles currently split between the operator and Network Rail in relation to stations.

A new risk sharing mechanism based on macroeconomic variables has been introduced to remove some of the perverse operator behaviour experienced under the Cap and Collar system, while still providing an appropriate allocation of risk between the taxpayer and the operator.

Cap and Collar led to stronger concentration on revenue generation schemes rather than on cost reduction because support was available in the event of underperformance on revenue. Our new risk sharing mechanism helps create a more balanced approach to revenue and costs when bidders are considering how to develop their business.

A profit share mechanism has been introduced to enable the taxpayer to benefit from a share in profits above an agreed threshold which the franchise has generated, while continuing to provide sufficient incentive for the franchisee to outperform.

The franchise will specify the introduction of ITSO based smart ticketing. The introduction of smart ticketing will provide significant benefits for passengers and the use of the ITSO standard will enable the same card to be used on a range of different public transport services.

The InterCity West Coast ITT takes forward the franchising reforms set out in January 2011. Given the diversity of the rail network, our approach will be adapted to meet the individual requirements of different franchises. Future franchise contracts will not be identical but common themes will underlie all of them, including an emphasis on innovation, passenger satisfaction and greater commercial freedom to respond to the needs of passengers.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120123,Review of Government support for maritime training scheme,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** Further to my announcement of 22 June 2011, I would like to inform Parliament of the outcome of the independent review into the requirement for Government support for merchant navy training and skills development and how best to spend any continuing Government funding.

I have concluded that continuing Government support for maritime training is required. The consultants' findings, accepted by the independent panel, were that there was a good value for money case for the retention of Government funding. Evidence was presented to me showing that for each working year of a seafarer who has benefitted from Government funding, approximately £14,500 in additional output is created relative to that of a UK worker displaying average productivity.

With over 90% of the UK's import and export trade by weight transported by the maritime sector, I believe continuing Government support in this area will reflect our ongoing commitment to economic growth and will help to maintain the competitiveness of this sector.

I have therefore decided to provide a budget of £12million a year for the support for maritime training scheme for the remainder of this Parliament. In view of the forecast national shortage of trained seafarers and the need to develop the next generation of UK officers and ratings, I intend that the majority of the budget be focussed on supporting initial training for cadets studying at junior officer level with the remainder supporting ratings training and ratings to officer conversion training.

I will be making a number of minor changes to the current scheme to achieve greater value for money by maximising the intake of trainees while ensuring more rigorous accountability structures are in place.

These changes are consistent with the Government's wider commitment to improve the transparency and accountability of public spending.

I will also be considering longer-term options to deliver merchant navy training within an overarching skills and apprenticeship framework.

A copy of the consultants' findings and the recommendations made by the independent panel have been placed in the Library of the House.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120125,Charging Heavy Goods Vehicles,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department for Transport has today launched a [consultation on a proposed road user charging scheme for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) of 12 tonnes and over](/consultations/dft-2012-03/). This is one of the commitments in the Coalition Programme for Government.

The proposal's primary objective is to ensure fairer arrangements for UK hauliers. UK-registered HGVs already pay tolls or user charges on motorways and, frequently, other roads in most EU Member States. Save on some specific pieces of infrastructure (the M6 Toll and various bridges and tunnels), there are no tolls or user charges in the UK. As most foreign operators currently purchase their HGVs' fuel outside the UK, they therefore contribute nothing towards the cost of our roads.

A scheme for HGV road user charging cannot discriminate between UK-registered vehicles and vehicles registered elsewhere in the EU. It will therefore apply to both UK and foreign-registered HGVs. It must also comply with the Eurovignette Directive (Directive 1999/62/EC as amended by 2006/38/EC and 2011/76/EU) which sets out a framework of rules for tolls and charges, including maximum daily rates for the latter.

We propose a simple time-based charge, applying to the use of any road in the United Kingdom, meaning that a five axle HGV of 38 tonnes or more would pay £1,000 a year or £10 a day. The Eurovignette Directive's maximum permitted charge is currently €11 per day, although by the introduction of the charge this is likely to have been uprated by inflation to €12 (about £10 at current exchange rates). The precise level of charges will depend on exchange rate movements and inflation between now and the implementation date later this Parliament. UK hauliers would pay an annual (or six months) charge for each HGV at the same time and in the same transaction as they pay its Vehicle Excise Duty. This would avoid extra administration costs for UK business. Foreign hauliers could pay daily, weekly, monthly or annual charges.

As VED and the charge are paid 12 months in advance, UK hauliers would begin to pay the user charge as they renewed an HGV's VED from eleven months before the introduction of charging for foreign vehicles.

The Government will also come forward with measures to offset the additional user charges for UK hauliers, through reductions in taxes, duties or charges they currently face, or through appropriate spending measures. The Chancellor has discretion over tax and spending measures, but the most likely balancing measure in practice will be a reduction in VED towards minimum EU levels.

The overall cost burden will not increase for the vast majority of UK-registered vehicles. We believe that, if we reduce VED to levels at or just above the minimum rates set out in the Eurovignette Directive, around 94% of the current UK vehicle fleet would be no worse off, with 98% paying no more than £50 a year extra.

Non-payment of the user charge would be a criminal offence, which could result in a fine imposed by the courts. The user charge would be enforced by DVLA records, ANPR cameras and checks by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) at the roadside. VOSA would also be able to issue fixed penalties on the spot to non-compliant drivers (and take financial deposits from drivers based outside the UK).

We are consulting on whether the scheme as a whole should be implemented, as well as on the details of the proposed charging bands, how the scheme will be administered, payment methods, enforcement and support for UK hauliers.

The consultation will run until 18 April 2012. The consultation document and associated tax impact assessment are available in the Library of the House, or on the DfT website at [www.dft.gov.uk](http://www.dft.gov.uk).

Lane rental would involve the local authority applying a daily charge where street works obstruct traffic at the busiest times, providing a clear financial incentive for works to be carried out in less disruptive ways.

The Government is now inviting applications from authorities wishing to operate 'pioneer' schemes. The guidance I am publishing today makes clear that the Government is prepared to approve up to three such schemes, in areas where the local authority has already sought to achieve the desired effect through other means, including through a road works permit scheme. Lane rental charges would need to be targeted on those streets where works cause the greatest disruption, and would need to provide a genuine opportunity for works promoters to avoid charges by carrying out their works at less disruptive times. Evidence from the performance of the 'pioneer' schemes will inform future decisions on whether lane rental should play a wider role. Any revenues raised from lane rental will have to be used for purposes that will help to reduce the disruption caused by works - for example research and development into disruption-saving techniques and technologies.

The guidance and other documents are now being published on the Department for Transport's website, and I will be laying the necessary Regulations before Parliament shortly.

In the light of that consultation, I find that there are persuasive arguments that this level of repayment would be insufficient to reflect the adverse impact on competition with other ports. I therefore intend shortly to seek independent advice on a more appropriate figure.

I will report further to the House when I have reached a decision on the DfT objection. As Liverpool City Council is aware, turnaround operations would also require State Aid clearance from the European Commission.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/grenning-20120131,Consultation on devolving local major transport schemes for the next Spending Review period,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** Today I am launching a consultation paper to take forward discussions for deciding a new devolved system for prioritising and funding local major transport schemes for the next Spending Review period - schemes which have cost over £5m.

The previous Government's Regional Funding Allocation process failed to give local people and communities proper transparency for decisions, and control over spending - investment decisions were taken centrally and it was a bureaucratic and inefficient system which hampered local enterprise and delivery. The Government has already made efficiencies on the programme of schemes inherited from this process. In total, schemes commencing construction in this Spending Review period are forecast to deliver benefits of around £8 for every £1 of public money spent, with a 34% reduction in the central Government contribution compared to previous plans.

We now have the opportunity of developing a new system for beyond 2015. A system which ensures that the best outcomes are achieved for the economy whilst balancing the need for developing sustainably and reducing carbon emissions; a system which hands real power to local communities; and, a system which is fit for purpose in practical delivery terms.

As local major transport schemes can take on average four years to move from business case to the start of construction, it is vital that we begin to develop a new system now.  And to fully empower local areas means giving them freedoms and flexibilities they have not had before.

Proposals set out in the consultation paper include: using a population based formula to allocate funding rather than putting in place a costly bidding process; a locally led assessment process for prioritising schemes, reducing the role of central Government which many local areas perceive as costly, time-consuming and autocratic; and, putting Local Enterprise Partnership areas in the driving seat over which transport schemes are delivered.

The Government is proposing to devolve decisions to democratically accountable local transport bodies involving Local Enterprise Partnerships and local authorities, which are given responsibility for establishing a prioritised programme of schemes for investment. These local transport bodies would oversee the delivery of individual schemes, but would not be the vehicle for delivery, which would remain with individual local authorities or other relevant delivery agencies.

Local Enterprise Partnerships would be central to decisions, to ensure that transport investment is fully aligned with plans for economic development. Local Enterprise Partnerships can play a strong role in helping to make the tough trade-offs between competing priorities and will have a say in investment financing. Transport authorities, however, would also be crucial given their expertise, responsibilities and leadership role on transport matters.

The new system would encourage decision-making across Local Enterprise Partnership boundaries to local transport consortia - groupings of Local Enterprise Partnership areas - in order to manage a handful of big schemes, which were experienced under previous systems.   However, the Government will not force consortia formations, which would risk creating ineffective and artificial partnerships that lack legitimacy.

Instead it will be for local areas to decide what collaborations are right for them and to prioritise eligible transport interventions, which they collectively agree to deliver local growth.

In return for greater devolution, central Government will need assurances on effective governance, financial management, accountability and the achievement of value for money - matters which businesses and local authorities do every day.

In particular, the Government proposes that while local areas will have the freedom to decide their own priorities and appraise individual schemes, all schemes would need to follow the Transport Business Case framework and be appraised in line with webTAG, the Department's best practice and well-evidenced guidance on transport appraisal and evaluation.

Individual schemes would also be expected to be dealt with transparently, in particular through the publication of business cases at each stage of scheme development, individual schemes meeting minimum value for money thresholds, ongoing review and monitoring, and pre and post delivery evaluation of scheme benefits.

The offer of devolution will be available to all, but different local areas will have different challenges and ambitions. The Government will take an individual approach with each local transport body to put in place a tailored system that is fit for purpose and secures value for money for the tax-payer.

I welcome responses to the consultation paper. The consultation runs from 31st January 2012 until 2nd April 2012. This is shorter than the usual 12 weeks but will help ensure there is a system in place which enables local areas to begin to construct schemes by 2015.

Following the end of the consultation, my Department will consider all responses and produce a summary report alongside setting out the next steps. I will make a further statement to the House at that point.

  1. Maintaining vehicle road worthiness and servicing is one of the most important costs of running a car for most motorists.  I am today announcing the Government's intention to work with industry and motoring organisations to improve the motorist's confidence and experience when they have to take their car, motorcycle or other private vehicle to a garage.

  2. Motorists are generally not experts in the mechanics, electronics or component parts of their vehicles -- what matters to them is that the vehicle is safe to be on the road, that they are paying a reasonable price and that what they are paying for is necessary work carried out to a good standard. Motorists want reliable servicing and MOTs from garages they trust and it is in the interests of reputable garages to deliver to a high quality.

  3. Almost every motorist has to visit a garage or other authorised testing station at least once a year for their vehicle to undergo an MOT test -- and for many people, that minimum statutory spot check of a vehicle's roadworthiness is either combined with an annual service or leads to repairs and further work. Each year in Great Britain some 35 million MOTs take place at some 21,000 authorised premises -- the annual cost to motorists of the test alone is in the region of £1.5 billion. The UK car service and repair sector is worth around £9 billion per year to the GB economy.

  4. The garage sector is regulated in several ways. The sector has to comply with business laws and consumer protection legislation. The MOT scheme is regulated by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) of the Department for Transport. Self-regulation has an important role to play also. For example, around 6500 garages self-regulate their customer service through the Motor Codes Ltd Code on Service and Repair which has full approval status under the OFT Approved Codes System. And nearly 1000 garages have been accredited with the BSI Kitemark scheme for automotive services.

  5. The package of measures I am announcing today does not duplicate these existing controls and arrangements. But they will add value for the motorist and enhance their experience when having to deal with garages whether for an MOT test or more generally.

  6. I am taking two immediate steps today. Firstly, having listened closely to the very many views put forward and considered the available evidence, I have decided that I am not going to carry out further work in relation to relaxing the first test date or the frequency of testing.

  7. Secondly, I am publishing for the first time today information gathered by VOSA about the standards of MOT testing. VOSA's MOT compliance survey 2010/11 showed that, despite large parts of the MOT test being subjective, 88% of testers were applying correct and consistent standards. There were 12% of testers who had their overall assessment of the vehicle's roadworthiness challenged by VOSA, suggesting there is still room for improvement. Publication of this data represents a considerable increase in transparency on the accuracy of MOT tests.

  8. VOSA already carries out targeted work to improve this figure.  However, I want to go further and make it easier for consumers to take action if they have not received the service they need from MOT testers. Further short term steps I am therefore taking are to:

    * engage the key motoring organisations in surveying their members over the next few months to determine the most significant and frequent problems they encounter at garages, how transparent and consistent charging and service standards are and what examples of best practice customer service they have experienced - and to publish their results.

    * Identify and work with organisations able to carry out mystery shopper exercises that could supplement those which VOSA already carry out as part of their targeted supervision of the scheme.

    * work with the Motorists' Forum to establish a sub-group to bring together a broad range of relevant motoring and industry organisations, such as the MOT Trade Forum, to help deliver the package that follows;

  9. Over the next six months my Department will carry out the following actions:

    * so that consumers can be confident that the garage they choose has signed up to deliver to the highest standards, we will work with the industry and stakeholders to encourage much wider adoption of existing Codes (such as that provided through the SMMT and Motor Codes Ltd) and to develop those Codes to include MOT testing services.  Our ambition is that it should be the norm for garages to comply with such Codes.

    * in order to make more information available to help motorists know how the scheme is supervised, which garages perform well and which less well, we will review the MOT data gathered by VOSA and - informed by the surveys above - further improve transparency.

    * we will also work with industry, motoring organisations and others to make it easier for consumers to give feedback on their experiences of garages in a transparent way that others can view, and to boost awareness of existing consumer feedback tools.

    * we will help motorists to spot clocked vehicles by arranging for MOT test certificates to show mileage information for the last three years, and encouraging car buyers to check the full MOT history of vehicles by accessing online the authoritative MOT database.

    * to help motorists know how long wear and tear items such as brakes and tyres are likely to last after an MOT test, we will work with the MOT trade initially to consider whether to adjust the MOT technical test standard.

  10. The Government intends to develop with the Motorists' Forum sub-group a robust means by which we can measure consumer confidence over time across all garage services.

  11. I see the above package of measures as an important element in our overall road safety policy, alongside delivering increased confidence and value for money for motorists having their vehicles MOT tested or serviced. I expect more ideas and measures to develop once the Motorists' Forum subgroup is established, and there will be opportunities for all interested parties to contribute to the debate.

The projects funded by this package support the key objectives of the £560m Local Sustainable Transport Fund - building a strong economy and tackling carbon. This additional £15m funding will be geared to supporting jobs, enhancing access to employment and supporting the end to end journey, helping to bring about changing patterns of travel behaviour and encouraging greater use of more sustainable transport modes.

The projects will be delivered to meet local demand and needs, and will be implemented through Sustrans and the Cycle Rail Working Group.

Sustrans will receive £8m to create routes along the lines of their successful ""Peoples' Millions"" Connect2 programme, further building on the Department's investment in Links to Schools, which have seen the construction of safe, traffic free and traffic calmed routes for cyclists and pedestrians between schools and the National Cycle Network.

The Cycle Rail Working Group will receive £7m to invest in improving integration between cycle and rail at stations across the country, including through improved cycle facilities at stations. This additional sum will complement other projects already being delivered by Network Rail, who are themselves delivering a £7m programme of cycle facilities at stations and safe access routes to stations.

Further details of the projects to be taken forward will be announced by press notice, and deposited in the libraries of the House, in March.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20120209,ATOL reform regulations,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** Today I am pleased to announce the Government's decisions on the proposals set out in last Summer's consultation on the reform of the Air Travel Organiser's Licensing (ATOL) scheme which can be introduced through new regulations under existing powers.

ATOL is a longstanding and important scheme, which last year protected 18 million holidaymakers from travel company failure. ATOL is particularly relevant in today's uncertain times, allowing consumers to book with the confidence that if their holiday company fails, their money will be protected or they will be able to return home as planned if they are already away, without any extra cost.

It is essential that the scheme should apply in an effective way in the modern holiday market; so that consumers are clear about their rights and how to use them, and holiday companies know which of their products must be protected.

In addition the Air Travel Trust Fund, which provides for refunds and repatriations under the scheme, is operating at a deficit and is supported by a Government guarantee. The Fund needs to return to a financially self-sustaining basis as soon as possible so that taxpayers' money is no longer exposed to risk.

Between 23 June and 15 September 2011 the Government consulted on a set of initial reforms to the ATOL scheme with the following objectives:

  * Improving clarity for consumers about what holidays are protected.
  * Returning Air Travel Trust Fund finances to a self-sustaining basis, with the deficit repaid and Government guarantee phased out.

The longer to medium term objectives are to:

  * Further improve the clarity of the scheme and develop a more consistent and coherent regulatory framework for businesses.
  * Look at options for how the ATOL scheme is managed and* financed once it is financially self-sustaining, with a view to reducing its cost to the travel trade and consumers.

The ATOL reform consultation received eighty two responses. I am grateful to stakeholders for taking the time to reply. In light of the responses and further analysis, I am confirming today that new ATOL regulations will be made that will:

  * Bring into the ATOL scheme Flight-Plus holidays sold by tour operators and travel agents. These are holidays that look like packages but don't meet the legal definition, and so do not currently require protection under the scheme. Including these holidays will end a significant source of confusion for consumers, and we expect up to an additional 6 million holidays a year will be fully ATOL protected as a result.
  * Ensure that on paying for an ATOL protected Flight-Only, package holiday or Flight-Plus, consumers receive a certificate confirming that their trip is covered by the scheme. To give the travel trade sufficient time to prepare, this requirement will come fully into effect on 1 October 2012. Until then, consumers will receive clear confirmation that their holiday or flight is ATOL protected.

Taking account of consultation responses and further discussion with stakeholders, the new ATOL regulations will include a number of changes to the draft regulations consulted on. These include changes to the definition of a Flight-Plus holiday and a revised approach to the exemption for Flight-Only sales where tickets are provided immediately on payment. Further details on these changes are included in the summary of responses and the Government's decisions published today on the Department's website.

  * [ATOL reform consultation summary of responses](/consultations/dft-2011-17/#responses)

It is intended that the new regulations will be laid in Parliament in March, before coming into effect on 30 April 2012.

In addition to bringing greater clarity to consumers about ATOL protection for holidays and flights, we expect that these reforms should allow the ATOL scheme's financial deficit to be repaid within three years. This will pave the way for possible future changes to improve how the ATOL scheme is funded and managed. The Civil Aviation Authority plans initial discussions with stakeholders on options for this later in the year, building on responses to the question posed in the consultation on this subject.

These regulations complement the clause in the Civil Aviation Bill introduced on 19 January 2012 that would allow the ATOL scheme to cover holidays sold by airlines and those organised on an agent for the consumer basis. Subject to Parliamentary process, the Government's intention is that such a step would only be taken following full consultation with stakeholders including an impact assessment.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120227,The Government Car and Despatch Agency: Delivering greater efficiency and reform,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: On 16 January 2012, I announced the significant operating cost reductions we have made in running the Government Car and Despatch Agency (GCDA) since May 2010. The previous Government had Ministerial cars for most Ministers, costing £6.8 million in 09/10. We are now spending just £3.8 million or 55% percent of that, and the number of Ministers requiring cars has reduced by around half.

Today, I am announcing our plans for the coming year in which we expect to deliver further operating cost savings of around one-third. This is part of our ongoing commitment to driving efficiency and improving value for money and transparency for tax payers. It will also allow us to start to reduce the overhead costs associated with the service.

To reflect the government's approach to providing vehicles for Ministers' official travel while maintaining adequate levels of security, I am taking this opportunity to identify a better taxpayer value service, reduce the vehicle fleet and maximise driver and vehicle utilisation. This approach will enable us to re-shape the agency and its estate to deliver a leaner and substantially smaller organisation.

We are working closely with Departments to deliver the main elements of this efficiency and reform programme which are:

  * the phased closure of the Government mail despatch service by the end of the year. I expect current users to make alternative, cost effective arrangements with their existing service providers or to utilise existing government frameworks to secure new services from the private sector;
  * a 50% reduction in the GCDA fleet with a new approach that gives greater control over management of the resource to Departments;
  * a review of estate options;
  * a review of the GCDA's agency status and whether, in the light of the much smaller scale of the operation, that continues to offer the best value for money.

The GCDA is working with Departments to help manage the transition to new arrangements. Subject to those discussions, I expect the changes to the car service to be fully operational by April this year and the transition to new mail arrangements to be completed by the end of the year.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120228,Crossrail train procurement,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** I would like to inform the House that the Invitation to Negotiate for the procurement of rolling stock and associated depot facilities has today been issued by Crossrail Limited.

Together with the Mayor of London, my co-sponsor on the Crossrail project, I welcome this major milestone in Crossrail's journey from inception to reality.

Crossrail will create vital new transport infrastructure to support economic growth. It will deliver faster journey times and a 10% increase in the capacity of London's rail network.

Crossrail Limited is inviting suppliers to design, manufacture, finance and service around 60 new trains and build a depot at Old Oak Common in West London. These new trains will provide around 27,000 seats, reducing congestion and bringing an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of London's major business centres.

Honourable members will recall that the previous Secretary of State for Transport committed to consider any relevant findings of the Government's Growth review as part of this and other large scale procurements. Honourable members will also be aware that My Right Honourable friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, published the National Infrastructure Plan in November 2011 and included a package of measures to reform public procurement in the Autumn Statement.

My department has been working with colleagues across Whitehall, and suppliers and delivery bodies to implement these recommendations. Across the transport sector we want to improve dialogue with suppliers and increase the long-term visibility of forthcoming contracts in order to strengthen the capability of the UK supply chain.

In respect of Crossrail, reflecting its stage in the procurement process, this Invitation to Negotiate is a clear example of how, working in partnership with the Mayor and Crossrail Limited, we are already adapting our approach:

First, the Invitation to Negotiate includes requirements for 'responsible procurement'. This means that bidders are required to set out how they will engage with the wider supply chain and provide opportunities for training, apprenticeships, and small and medium size businesses within their procurement strategy. Bidders are also required to establish an appropriate local presence to manage the delivery of the contract.

The Mayor and I are also keen to understand and communicate the benefit of this contract to the UK economy; bidders are being asked, in the Invitation to Negotiate, to specify from where each element of the contract will be sourced. This is not an assessment criterion in the decision process however the successful bidder will be required to report against their proposed estimates.

Second, Crossrail Limited, which has already developed a reputation for being an industry leader in this field, will ensure that, going forward, this procurement is efficient and effective and does not involve unnecessary costs for the bidders.

In addition, this contract will provide a significant element of public investment, alongside private finance, optimising the balance of public debt and transfer of risk to the private sector.  This approach will help ease the costs of debt repayments to the public purse, as well as reduce bidders' requirements to raise debt and equity, while still transferring significant risk to the private sector ensuring that we secure value for money. First and foremost, the successful bidder must be able to deliver the right trains and depot facilities.

Above all, I want this procurement to be a fair process that provides best value for money for the UK taxpayer and future fare-payers and high quality, reliable trains for the millions of people that will use Crossrail services every week.

Four bidders will be receiving the Invitation to Negotiate having performed strongly at the pre-qualification stage and I look forward to a highly competitive process. The contract will be awarded in Spring 2014.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120301,Mobility Scooters and Powered Wheelchairs,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker): In 2010, the Department for Transport undertook a consultation into possible reforms of the use on the highway of mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs (referred to in legislation as ""invalid carriages"").

I am today publishing the Department's response to the consultation. A summary of the results of the consultation is also attached to that document.

I have concluded that no changes should be made regarding the following issues, which formed part of the consultation:

  * speed limits and maximum permitted speeds;
  * the minimum age for using a Class 3 vehicle; and
  * the law relating to the use of a mobility scooter by only one person.

I do not, at this stage, propose that there should be an alternative to the current arrangements for registering Class 3 vehicles or any additional requirements for making vehicles conspicuous, such as adding reflective strips to vehicles or a requirement on users to wear high visibility jackets. I have decided that the maximum unladen weight of Class 2 powered wheelchairs should be increased to 150kgs, but that the Class 2 mobility scooter should stay at the current maximum unladen weight of 113.4kgs.

I have also decided that the legal term ""invalid carriage"" should be replaced with a more suitable and contemporary term, and have asked officials to consider how this might be achieved, recognising that unfortunately, the term is set by primary legislation.

I indicated in Parliamentary Answers last autumn (Official Report 26 October 2011: Column 249W and 27 October 2011: Column 284W) that I was considering the case for mandatory eyesight testing. I have concluded that this is not necessary for users of Class 2 vehicles, but in response to points made by respondents to the consultation, I believe the position in respect of Class 3 scooters requires further consideration. To that end, I intend to convene a meeting of interested parties to review the available evidence and options, including matters relating to insurance and the use of specialist training providers. I am conscious of the crucial role such vehicles play in some people's lives and that will be an important factor in deciding what further actions, if any, to take.

From 2013, the police will be able to record whether a vehicle has been involved in an accident on the public highway, but I have also asked officials to examine how current legislation aimed at reducing accidents could be better enforced.

The Transport Select Committee invited the Department to look into the carriage of mobility scooters on public transport. The Confederation of Passenger Transport has produced a Code of Practice regarding carriage on buses, while train operators have their own individual arrangements. I have asked my Department to work with transport operators and the industry to develop a kite marking scheme for public transport, which would enable a disabled person to have more confidence that they can travel with their mobility scooter - this work is currently underway. I have also asked officials to work with the industry on suitable designs for public transport. I will report back on this work as soon as possible.

I am also publishing today, improved guidance and information for mobility vehicle users.

## Opening remarks

With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on railways.

Our rail network matters... to our quality of our life... our national wellbeing... and our country's future prosperity.

For this Government it's a simple equation... good transport equals good economics.

But, too often, we find ourselves frustrated and disappointed when the cost, punctuality or comfort of rail travel don't come up to scratch.

I believe that Government and the rail industry can and must do more for passengers and for taxpayers.

Of course, investment has a huge part to play.

That is why we've been investing in our transport infrastructure... because that's one of the best ways to support business, generate growth and create jobs.

And, for rail, that has meant the biggest modernisation programme since the Victorian age with  £18 billion invested in this spending period.

But Mr Speaker, it's not enough only to invest in them... it's also vital to make sure they are set up for success.

So today, I am setting out our plans to do precisely that, with the publication of our Rail Command Paper, entitled 'Reforming our Railways: Putting the Customer First'.

## Efficiency Gap

Mr Speaker, I have taken the 'Ronseal' approach to the name. This strategy will do what it says on the tin: put the customer first.

The hallmarks of our railway must be high standards **and** low costs... a railway that offers the best services **and** the best value.

That means a rail network which is efficient, effective and affordable.

Nevertheless, in his Rail Value for Money Study, Sir Roy McNulty concluded that our railways are among the most expensive in Europe... and that's in spite of the strong and steady growth in the number of passengers using them.

Sir Roy identified inefficiencies worth £2.5 to £3.5 billion-a-year... and the people picking up the tab for this costly efficiency gap are passengers and taxpayers.

So reform is long overdue.

**Passengers** rightly want to know that we have a plan to end the era of inflation-busting fares seen over recent years.

And **taxpayers** rightly want to see railway subsidy reduced to help us tackle the fiscal deficit.

My message to everyone today is very clear. The days of spiralling and unjustified rail costs are coming to an end.

Under this Government, the rail industry will only be able to compete for future investment if its long-term cost issues are addressed, and if it can earn the right to grow.

I'm pleased to say that Network Rail is already due to deliver £1.2 billion of efficiency savings by 2014 with at least a further £600 million expected by 2019.

But, as Sir Roy so clearly set out, we need to go further. The railway **as a whole** needs to become less dependent on Government subsidies. That's why we want the industry to fully close the efficiency gap of £3.5 billion per year identified by Sir Roy, by 2019.

Managing and reducing costs. Balancing budgets. Targeting investment where it can drive long-term growth and jobs, delivering more capacity and better service for the investment that goes in.

## Government's response - the Command Paper

The time is right for reform. I believe we are in a good position to build on recent efficiency gains to further improve the performance of the industry - and to improve the passenger experience.

The programme of work that will decide rail outcomes and funding for the five-year period from 2014 is now well under way, and this sits alongside a period when we will see the biggest round of re-franchising since the privatisation of the industry. Both represent a further opportunity to really change our railways for the long-term better.

Today's Command Paper sets out our ambitions for Britain's railways and the agenda for change that both Government and industry will follow in the months and years ahead.

By reforming the industry, we will achieve substantial savings. Those savings will allow us to cut and then abolish above-inflation rises in average regulated fares... and it will ease the burden of the railway on the broader public purse.

Taken together with my decision to limit the most recent increase in regulated fares I believe this will have a positive long-term impact on household budgets.

## Closer working between industry parties

For reform to really be effective there needs to be closer collaboration between the infrastructure managers, in other words Network Rail, and those who provide passenger services, generally the Train Operating Companies.

Only through better joint working will we reduce costs and improve the customer experience.

The industry is already pushing for better alignment between track and train.

We look to them to bring forward partnerships equipped and incentivised to deliver not just better services, but also better value.

The rail industry, led by the Rail Delivery Group, has also declared itself willing and able to respond to the strategic and operational challenges that the railway faces.

Such leadership across the industry will be essential if we are to get the most out of our reforms.

## Franchises, fares and ticketing

Rail franchises will be reformed with greater transparency around costs and efficiency... again to ensure best value for fare-payers and taxpayers.

Franchises will be longer, giving train operators the flexibility they have been asking for, more time to make the biggest investments - to deliver what passengers want, within a sustainable budget.

We will also move to a more transparent, modern and flexible approach to fares and ticketing. We are launching a consultation today to take views on how these key aims can be achieved.

It's time to bring fares out of the 1970s and into the 21st Century.

We will expand smart ticketing to give more passengers the kinds of benefits that travellers in the capital already enjoy with Oyster cards.

Working with industry we will roll out smartcards across England and Wales and across different operators, increasing convenience for passengers.

Smartcards are also pivotal to introducing a more flexible system tailored to customers, with a wider choice of tickets and season cards, recognising the reality that not all journeys take place five days a week during rush hour.

## The rail workforce

Mr Speaker, If we duck the reform challenge then it won't just be rail users and the public purse that pay the price... ultimately the rail industry and the wider economy will suffer too.

So we want everyone working in rail, be it management or front-line, to help make these reforms work.

By reducing costs and increasing demand set alongside this Government's huge investment in railways there is genuine potential to boost jobs across the industry.

## Network Rail

It's important to reform governance too.

Network Rail is giving greater decision-making powers to its regional Route Directors, making it more responsive to local conditions and increasingly focused on day-to-day train operations at the local level.

We welcome Network Rail's efforts to find new and more efficient ways of managing its assets, including long-term concessions to third parties for the management of parts of the network.

Network Rail is rightly taking steps to reform corporate governance... including its management incentives package - so that it is more accountable to passengers and freight customers.

I would also like to welcome its sensible decision - to be announced shortly - to voluntarily appoint a Public Interest Director, who will ensure the concerns of taxpayers are fully reflected at board level and help strengthen the role of members.

## Decentralisation - local authorities and the ORR

Mr Speaker, it's time to give communities more control over local services.

So today we are also consulting on devolving decisions about the railway to sub-national bodies.

And our joint consultation with the Office of Rail Regulation on a greater role for the ORR in regulating passenger franchises closed recently. With a smarter regulatory approach, our aim is to remove Government from day-to-day industry involvement by adopting a more unified regulatory structure for the railways.

We will publish our conclusions in due course.

## Concluding remarks

Mr Speaker,

Facing up to reality... saving farepayers and taxpayers £3.5 billion a year... reforming our railways... putting the customer first. That's what this Command Paper is all about.

And, by working together on this package of reform, I believe industry, regulator and Government can generate the savings and the change we need.

Lower costs, better services and ticketing offering greater choice and flexibility.

A rail industry built to last because it's efficient, effective and affordable.

That's what this Command paper will deliver and I commend it to the House.

In December 2010, I made a commitment not to increase light dues for at least three years; the industry welcomed it, and I remain committed to it [Official Report, Column 19WS].

Over the last year, I have continued to work with the General Lighthouse Authorities to identify where it is prudent and appropriate to rationalise services, enlisting the expertise of the Authorities' Joint Strategic Board to examine the question of pension liabilities and ever-closer working between the General Lighthouse Authorities themselves. We have identified and exploited considerable opportunities for greater efficiency, the most notable relating to aids to navigation monitoring centralisation, buoy yard reorganisation and staffing reductions. These have succeeded in lowering running costs substantially, against a targeted five year reduction of 17% the General Lighthouse Authorities now expect to achieve 19%.

Furthermore, the Department for Transport tendered and replaced part of the General Lighthouse Fund investment portfolio to facilitate its use for a General Lighthouse Authorities staff pension reserve; the new portfolio reduces investment risk and facilitates stability.

These initiatives and efficiencies have enabled me to freeze light dues this year. Since I became Shipping Minister, there has been a real terms light dues reduction of around 10%.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120313a,Street works overrun penalties ,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: Today I am announcing the Coalition Government's plans to increase the penalties that local authorities can impose where street works by utility companies and others overrun their agreed duration. This follows a consultation launched by the previous government.

The maximum charge for the busiest streets will rise from £2,500 a day to £5,000 a day for the first three days of overrun and £10,000 a day thereafter, rather than the £25,000 per day planned by the previous administration. I consider that the new charge level will result in a decrease in the number of works which overrun their agreed period, and better reflect the congestion costs overrunning works impose on society.

I also intend to change the regulations such that works planned to be only of a short duration attract the same overrun charge as those of longer planned durations, in recognition of the fact that all these works cause equivalent disruption to the road user.

These changes are in line with the Government's commitment to ensure regulatory proposals are proportionate, our desire to see congestion caused by roadworks reduce, and for utilities and others who work in our streets to be held accountable for that congestion.

The full consultation response can be [found on the Department's website](/consultations/dft-2010-13).

To take forward these proposals, I will lay regulations before this House in the summer. It is my intention that the changes come into force in October of this year.

The Presidency hopes to achieve general approach on the following:

A proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Union guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). Progress to date has been encouraging. The revised text issued by the Presidency has gone some way to addressing our concerns particularly in relation to binding standards and deadlines. And also by recognising the need to take account of Member States' finances and to consider the economic viability of projects. Additionally, I will continue to push for changes on the Core Network and TEN-T corridors to minimise risks to the UK. I will consider whether the improvements achieved are satisfactory to justify UK support for a general approach.

A proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council. This proposal would amend the specification for tachographs, which measure hours spent at the wheel by commercial lorry and bus drivers. The proposed general approach addresses many of the concerns raised through negotiations, including:

  * Removing the proposed ban of operators with tachograph workshops from installing or calibrating tachographs in their own vehicles. Member States are left to take appropriate measures to prevent conflicts of interests between workshops and operators.
  * Removing the proposal to merge the driving licence with the tachograph card.

These represent significant gains for the UK with regard to minimising costs and burdens on industry and the Government.

A proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on ground-handling services at EU airports and repealing Council Directive 96/67/EC (part of the airport package). The proposed regulation has been subject to intense official-level scrutiny by Council Working Groups and these discussions are ongoing. Progress to date has been encouraging from a UK perspective, and we believe that the resulting regulation could potentially help further open-up market access while minimising administrative and financial burdens for industry. However, at this stage, it remains unclear whether or not it will be possible to seek a general approach at the March Council. If it is not possible, there will be an orientation debate instead.

Under any other business, the Commission will provide information on the Costa Concordia accident, the Aviation Emissions Trading System and the Galileo and EGNOS Programmes.

In line with my duties under the GLA Act 1999, and after formally consulting the Mayor, I am therefore today reconfirming the GLA Transport Grant for 2012-13 at £2.829 billion. This grant is provided by the Government to Transport for London to deliver transport services and investment in the capital, including London Underground.

In line with my [predecessor's 20 October 2010 letter to the Mayor ""Spending Review 2010: TfL funding agreement""](/publications/hammond-20101020) and the Chancellor's fare announcement on 20 October 2011, £881 million of this grant is designated an Investment Grant. This will support the delivery of vital tube upgrades, providing journey time savings and extra capacity for passengers, as well as investment in station upgrades and other projects, as set out in Annex B of the 20 October letter. The remaining £1.948 billion is for the purposes of TfL.

Taken together, this significant investment will get more people on buses, and so aid the Department's overarching objectives of helping to create growth and cut carbon.

The quality of the bids for the Better Bus Area Fund and Green Bus Fund have been excellent and I am pleased to report that because of the prudent financial management of the Department's funds by the Secretary of State and her Ministerial team, I have been able to increase the allocations previously announced, from £20m to £31m in respect of the Green Bus Fund, and from £50m to £70m in respect of the Better Bus Area Fund.

Projects under these two funds will help drive forward our bus travel in England, helping buy, amongst other things:

  * 439 low-carbon buses to forge the future of the low carbon economy (we expect the majority of these to be manufactured in the UK);
  * the development of hop-on hop-off multi-operator tickets that put spontaneity back into the hands of the passenger;
  * real time information for bus passengers and for bus operators to cut down waiting time and prevent buses bunching up. No more waiting for a bus and then three come along at once;
  * smarter traffic lights that recognise buses and give them priority with barely an impact on other traffic.

24 lead local transport authorities across England will benefit from the £70m Better Bus Area Fund, right across the country. 5 local transport authorities and 26 bus companies have been awarded £31 million of Green Bus funding.

Together this package will encourage people onto the bus, cutting congestion, promoting a low carbon transport infrastructure and encouraging growth.

Documents listing the successful bidders under each competition have been placed in the libraries of the House, and are being published on the DfT website.

I will be in a position to make a further statement on bus subsidy reform in the near future.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120326a,Olympic penalty charges,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) made proposals to me, following consultation, for the level of penalty charges and associated fees that should apply for civil contraventions of parking and other traffic management measures in Traffic Regulation Orders and Notices made for defined Games purposes on the Olympic Route Network (ORN) and elsewhere in England.  I am today announcing my decision on these proposals under the provisions of the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006.

The ODA proposed that in most locations the normal level of penalties and fees should apply, and that in all places the normal discounts and surcharges for early and late payment should apply. However they also proposed that in order to help secure a high level of voluntary compliance with the temporary parking and other traffic management measures essential to the Games' success increased penalties of £200 should apply on the ORN, and in two of the Residents and Business Parking Protection (or 'LATM&P') Areas being established around the Games venues - around the Olympic Park and in the Greenwich River Zone.  In addition ODA proposed a higher vehicle pound release fee of £300 in the same two areas.

I have decided not to approve higher than normal penalties and fees on the ORN and in these areas, and to require all penalties and fees to be set at normal levels. I endorse the importance of securing a high level of compliance with the temporary traffic management measures, for the benefit of both the Games and local residents and businesses.  However I am not persuaded that a higher level of penalties and fees is an essential addition to the strategy of communication and advice to residents, businesses and motorists about the measures and their enforcement that is already well underway, supported by plans for effective on-street enforcement activity during the Games, including tow-away resources. I consider that increased penalties and fees would be an unnecessary burden in a challenging economic climate when we are already asking businesses and commuters to consider making significant changes to their travel behaviour during the Games.

My decision concerns penalties for contraventions of new temporary measures implemented for the Games.  It is consistent with that taken by the Mayor of London on 15 March not to approve temporary increases in the penalties and fees for contravention of existing measures in Traffic Regulation Orders on the ORN in London and in the same Residents and Business Parking Protection Areas.

I am placing in the Libraries of the House a copy of ODA's table showing their proposals and the normal penalties and fees applicable in different locations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120326a,"Bus policy, regulation and funding","Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am today announcing a series of reforms which I propose to make to improve the system of local bus subsidy and regulation in England. These are set out in the paper 'Green Light for Better Buses', copies of which I have placed in the libraries of the House.

I am also pleased to announce today an extra £15 million in funding for increasing the uptake of smart ticketing equipment, particularly among small and medium-sized companies. This makes a total bus funding package of £115m, if taken alongside last week's announcement (_Official Report_ 23 March 2012, Column 81WS) on Better Bus Areas (£70 million) and the Green Bus Fund (£31 million).  This considerable sum underlines the Coalition Government's firm commitment to investment in transport infrastructure, tackling congestion, and decarbonising transport.

Over the past year, I have been discussing with bus companies, local transport authorities and passenger groups the need for reforms to the Bus Services Operator Grant which the Government pays to every company that runs local bus services. The system of subsidy we have inherited is poorly targeted. It does not distinguish between profitable services and those that require local council support. It does not take into account the differing public transport needs of urban and rural areas. And it does little to incentivise fuel efficient buses.

The proposals I am announcing today have been carefully formulated to attract more people onto buses, to ensure better value for the taxpayer and to give local transport authorities more influence over their local bus networks. They also signal a move to break the link between fuel use and subsidy.

The Government has also responded today to the recommendations from the Competition Commission's report into the supply of local bus services in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland and London). We have committed to introduce regulatory changes that will remove the barriers facing bus companies that attempt to engage in competition on new bus routes and in new bus markets.

We will also support and guide urban areas in their efforts to introduce new reasonably-priced tickets that can be used on any bus, not just on those of a single company. And we will help local councils in their procurement of tendered bus services.

The Government's forthcoming Aviation Policy Framework will set out key parameters for aviation, including on noise annoyance to local communities. To ensure our proposals to replace the current night flying regime can take account of the Aviation Policy Framework which the Government has committed to have in place by next spring, and will include the framework for managing noise, we will extend the existing night flying regime at these airports for a period of two years until October 2014. As a first step to replace the current regime in 2014, we will launch a first stage consultation later this year which will seek detailed evidence of the effectiveness of the current regime including costs and benefits and airlines' fleet replacement plans. This will be followed by a second consultation next year which will enable us to take account of adopted policy when developing our specific proposals.

The Government will take into account the freeze in quota limits during this extension period when setting the next regime and expects airlines to continue to improve their environmental performance in the interim.

Further details of the extension and the timetable for setting a new regime have been published on the Department's website.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20120327a,EU Transport Council,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers)**: I attended the first Transport Council under the Danish Presidency (the Presidency) in Brussels on Thursday 22 March.

The Presidency sought agreement to a general approach on a proposal for a regulation which defines the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). This sets out the actions to be undertaken at EU and Member State level to develop the network. I was able to support the general approach after securing a UK amendment that will ensure that progress on the projects required by the Regulation would be subject to the availability of financial resources. This amendment received support from Germany, Latvia, Finland, Romania, Ireland, Bulgaria, Slovenia and France. In my contribution to the debate I also argued that governance structures on corridors should be less burdensome, more flexible and focus on contentious cross-border projects. Most member states supported the compromise text which was viewed as a balance between the Commission's initial proposals and what they could accept.

The Council also agreed a general approach on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on ground-handling services at EU airports and repealing Council Directive 96/67/EC. This proposal is part of the Airports Package. My intervention emphasised the UK's reservations about the cost impact and administrative burdens of the original proposal, but I acknowledged that these had been largely addressed in the Presidency's revised text. In particular, I welcomed the removal of compulsory licensing and of the Commission's proposed powers to tell a Member State to close its markets to third country operators that refused to open theirs. Another important point secured in the negotiations in the run up to the meeting was the assurance that service quality would be set locally, with enforcement centred on the contractual relationships between airports, airlines and ground-handlers, with efforts to set homogenised Europe-wide standards removed from the proposal.

In the light of these changes and the fact that the regulation is expected to deliver more competition in ground-handling at airports in other European countries and hence reduce costs for airlines (and indirectly for passengers), I felt able to support the Presidency's compromise text.

Under any other business, the Commission set out their future intentions on the follow up to the Costa Concordia accident in Italy in January. They intend to carry out a review of legislative proposals on domestic passenger ships, to be submitted for consideration at the IMO (International Maritime Organisation). The Commissioner also indicated there may be a revision to the Ship Stability Directive, and work on watertight doors, with a second wave of regulatory activity later in the year. The Commissioner was supportive of renewed discussion both with the EU and the IMO on Passenger Ship Safety. Italy gave an account of the emergency response to the accident and noted there would be an administrative enquiry.

I intervened to stress the need for a considered response that takes on board the outcome of the investigation currently underway before any decisions are taken as to whether regulatory changes are needed.

Also under any other business, the Commission provided an update on the international reaction to the inclusion of aviation in the Emissions Trading System (ETS). The Commission reported that the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) had initiated new work to identify a global market based measure for the aviation sector. If this work leads to an international agreement on tackling climate change emissions from aviation, the EU could, as set out in the ETS Directive, review its legislation. I stressed the importance of maintaining a unified and robust European position and there was clear support from other Member States for the Aviation ETS.

The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport on which the Presidency was hoping for a general approach and the any other business item Galileo and EGNOS Programmes on which the Commission was providing information, were not discussed at the Council.

During my visit, I was also able to hold a bilateral discussion with the Vice President of the Commission, Siim Kallas on the main items for Transport Council discussion. A constructive exchange took place on upcoming Commission proposals for airport slots and rail policy. I used the opportunity to highlight the UK's work with the Commission on the better regulation agenda.

I also met my counterparts from Cyprus and Ireland to discuss plans for their forthcoming Presidencies of the EU, in July-December 2012 and in January-June 2013, respectively. The Cypriots' main priorities focus on re-energising the Integrated Maritime Policy, and promoting 'Blue Growth'. The Irish are at an early stage in their preparations and sought UK's views ahead of their Presidency. My discussion with the Cypriots and Irish Ministers also included an overview of the important work that the UK is taking forward with the European Commission on the Better Regulation agenda.

Early indications from a limited pilot are encouraging and I am pleased feedback so far has been positive.

I have now asked the Agency to further develop the model. Five additional areas have been identified in and/or surrounding: Kettering, Glasgow, Manchester, Worcester and Watford. These will be centred on an existing driving test centre 'hub'. They represent a mix of urban and rural locations. Examiners based at the hub will conduct tests from additional satellite locations within the zone. Subject to finding suitable premises and the availability of driving test standard routes I have asked DSA to explore the possibility of providing tests from the following satellite locations:

Kettering - Corby, Market Harborough and Wellingborough

Glasgow - Johnstone, Renfrew, East Kilbride, Cathcart and Bearsden

Manchester - Cheadle, Altrincham, Salford, Middleton, Ashton-under-Lyne and Oldham

I am also pleased to announce the publication of a Prior Information Notice in the Official Journal of the European Union for public and private organisations to work in partnership with the DSA to identify and provide locations from which the practical car test could be delivered. DSA will encourage engagement by a wide section of the business community, including retail and hotel groups to provide premises from which the Agency could operate.

Tests will continue to be conducted by DSA examiners.

This is an important next step in our aspiration for a truly national high speed network, as set out in our Programme for Government. Phase 2 of High Speed Two will spread the benefits of high speed rail further across the country, increasing capacity and enhancing connectivity by extending high speed rail lines to Leeds and Manchester and connecting other major conurbations in the North and in Scotland through seamless transition onto the existing network.

In fulfilment of its remit, HS2 Ltd's advice will include options for stations in Manchester, Leeds, South Yorkshire, the East Midlands and at Heathrow Airport, as well as advice on the case and potential locations for additional stations. It will also cover the impact of Phase 2 of the network in releasing capacity on the Midland and East Coast main lines, as well as further extending the benefits of released capacity within the West Coast corridor.

I will consider this advice objectively and in detail over the coming months, and I intend to publish it in the autumn together with a Government response setting out initial preferred route and station options. An important part of this process will be to consider the views of delivery partners in the cities where HS2 stations may be located, including any underpinning evidence which they have identified. Understanding local desires and plans for development will be crucial in helping me reach initial preferences for station locations. I am particularly keen to ensure that the network best supports the economic potential of the cities and regions it serves, through well-integrated station locations that build on local and regional plans.

Minimising the risk of blight is a serious consideration, and it is for this reason that I expect to publish HS2 Ltd's advice once I have reached a view on routes and station options. Publishing a detailed range of possible options without an indication of the Government's preferences would generate unnecessary and harmful blight across areas that ultimately might never be affected by the lines. I will be working with national environmental stakeholders to discuss key sustainability issues and how best to consult on lines of route going forward to help meet the needs of different stakeholders and the public.

Following publication, the input of interested parties, including MPs and their constituents, will be valuable to help further develop the proposals that will go forward for subsequent formal public consultation. Only once a full public consultation has been launched and completed will any decisions be reached.

When preferred route options are published in the autumn we will consult on and introduce an Exceptional Hardship Scheme to assist property owners impacted by the proposals. Further, in order to reduce uncertainty for those affected by the proposals, and to ensure that the benefits for passengers and business of a national high speed rail network are realised as soon as possible, I have asked my officials to explore options for bringing forward formal public consultation on Phase 2 of High Speed 2 to 2013, and I will set out my proposed timetable later this year.

We also committed to undertake further work to evaluate the potential impact of these measures before final decisions were made. This work, undertaken in conjunction with the aviation sector and the Government's security experts, led to a revised set of planned airspace restrictions which were announced on 19 July 2011.

Since July 2011, the Government, with the assistance of the Civil Aviation Authority, has been preparing the necessary Statutory Instruments to give effect to the planned airspace restrictions. These detailed Regulations have now been signed on behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport and will enter into force on 1 June 2012. NATS, the UK's en-route air traffic service provider and publisher of the UK's aeronautical information, will be publishing the details of these Regulations on 17 May 2012 in its next Aeronautical Information Circular. In addition, full details of the planned airspace restrictions, including maps, can be [found on the Airspace Safety Initiative web site](http://www.airspacesafety.com/Olympics).

In total there are 15 sets of Regulations, three covering the London area (a restricted zone for the main Olympics and prohibited zones for the Olympics and for the Paralympics), five covering the Olympic football tournament stadia at Old Trafford, Coventry, Newcastle, Glasgow, and Cardiff, and the remainder protecting the sailing venue at Weymouth, rowing at Egham and Eton Dorney, the road cycling events at Leatherhead and Brands Hatch, the canoeing events at the Lee Valley White Water Centre and the mountain bike racing at Hadleigh Farm in Essex.

Following extensive engagement with the aviation community, the Regulations have been designed to minimise, where possible, their impact on aviation business, while ensuring the safety and security of the Games. They also provide specific exemptions for aircraft such as those operated by the Police or emergency medical services to enter the protected airspace, and for the Olympic Broadcasting Service to operate over the venues. We do not expect that any airports will need to close as a result of the planned measures, and there should be little or no impact on scheduled air services.

The Government's paramount objective is the delivery of a safe and secure 2012 Games for all, and the airspace restrictions will help to provide this whilst minimising the impact on the aviation community, so far as possible. However, the Government reserves the right to implement additional airspace security measures should the need arise.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20120515a,Operational freedoms at Heathrow Airport,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** My statement of 14 July 2011 (Column 55WS) announced a phased trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow Airport to gather evidence in relation to the greater use of tactical measures, in defined and limited circumstances, to prevent or mitigate disruption and to facilitate recovery. The trial is run by BAA, the airport operator, with oversight provided by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the independent aviation regulator.

These measures are consistent with the Government's commitment to runway alternation at Heathrow. I would also emphasise that the trial will not increase the number of flights at Heathrow which remains capped at current levels.

Phase one of the trial ran from 1 November 2011 until 29 February 2012. An interim report on the first two months of phase one was published by the CAA on 21 February 2012 . [The CAA has today published its final report on phase one](http://www.caa.co.uk/apfg), alongside a report by BAA, assessing the impact on operations at the airport and on communities around Heathrow.

The CAA's report is encouraging about the benefits of the measures trialled so far, but suggests that more detailed data and analysis is required from phase two to draw definite conclusions on these and the impacts on local communities.

The CAA report concluded BAA ran phase one of the trial within the parameters agreed with Government and generally collected and published data for analysing the trial in an appropriate and transparent manner. The CAA noted that the broad spectrum of interested parties, and the technical nature of the measures trialled, made successful engagement with local communities challenging; and they made suggestions for improvement.

The report also accepted BAA's analysis that phase one of the trial recorded:

  * dual arrivals were deployed for 3.2% of westerly arrivals at the airport (1802 out of 56260 arrivals); an average increase of 13 de-alternated flights each day on westerly arrivals, from 21 to 34 per day;
  * dual departures were deployed for 0.07% of westerly departures at the airport (38 out of 55860 departures);
  * operational improvements in relation to arrival punctuality and delay, stacking (under specific circumstances) and taxi times following arrival;
  * A large increase in complaints, although it was not clear whether these were generated by the use of operational freedoms, as a proportion appear to correlate to a prolonged period of easterly operations which was due to weather conditions rather than the trial;
  * generally low awareness of the trial but some support for it from residents surveyed when its objectives were explained; and
  * no detriment to safety.

In my previous statement, I also set out the timetable for phase two of the trial. Following advice from the CAA, I am announcing today that I have agreed to a six month extension of phase two which will now run from July 2012 to March 2013.

The CAA concluded that the relatively short duration of phase one meant that the evidence it provided on the impact of operational freedoms was more limited than anticipated, partially as a result of an unusually high level of easterly operations. The extension until March 2013 will increase the amount of data generated enabling a more robust analysis of the benefits and impacts, allowing a direct comparison between phases one and two. A longer trial will also reduce the risk that external factors (such as easterly winds) significantly limit the amount of usable information. This will ensure that the eventual consultation with local communities on whether a more permanent operational freedoms regime is adopted at the airport is based on a sufficient level of evidence.

Phase two will also mean that Heathrow will benefit from greater resilience during the Olympic and Paralympic Games period when the airport will be under more pressure than usual.

Improving punctuality, tackling delay and strengthening resilience at Heathrow would improve the quality of the UK's international connections and enhance the reputation of our largest international gateway. Phase one has shown that, without prejudging our views on the associated impacts, there is potential to deliver operational benefits without increasing capacity. We therefore have grounds to believe that there is still more that can be done to deliver a better Heathrow, while continuing to protect communities affected by aircraft noise.

I have therefore agreed to the continuation of the trial of tactical use of dual arrivals and departures measures agreed for the first phase. I have also agreed that the following freedoms should be added to phase two:

  * Aircraft scheduled to arrive after 0600 will be permitted to land between 0530 and 0600 provided that the same number of flights scheduled to arrive between 0430 and 0500 are rescheduled to after 0500. This is expected to delay the onset of noise disturbance to local communities in the early morning period and enhance the resilience of the schedule;
  * During ""segregated"" operations departing aircraft may be re-directed (radar vectored) by air traffic control from their normal routes of departure (mostly within pre-determined noise preferential routes). This is expected to improve the reliability of the schedule by increasing the departure rate from a single runway and improve the scope for reducing the number of unscheduled night flights;
  * Subject to approval of the safety case by CAA, it is intended to apply the same principles to enable dual departures later in phase two, but only within the pre-determined noise preferential routes;
  * The cap on the more flexible use of dual arrivals allowed as part of the trial will be raised from 6 to 12 per hour;
  * The proactive tests used briefly in phase one will be continued. The periods during which these tests will be undertaken will be announced on BAA's website during the first month of phase two.

BAA will shortly begin a further period of engagement with local authorities, communities and other stakeholders around the operation of phase two, particularly on the monitoring of noise impacts. Once the trial is complete, the evidence collected will provide the basis for a consultation with local communities. This will consider whether an operational freedoms regime of some form should be adopted on a more permanent basis at Heathrow and if so what safeguards should apply in relation to its use. This consultation will inform the subsequent decision by Ministers.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120516a,Airport Charges Price Controls,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: Today, I am issuing directions under section 40(9) of the Airports Act 1986 to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) not to make references to the Competition Commission (CC) in respect of mandatory airport charges conditions for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. These references would have been made in the context of the economic regulation of these airports under the 1986 Act before the expiry of their current price controls on 31 March 2014.

The Civil Aviation Bill is proposing to remove the Competition Commission reference from the price review process permanently and replace it with a licensing and appeals regime. This will enable proportionate and accountable regulation, and will give airlines and airports a new right of appeal which the aviation sector have not had before - modernising the airport regulatory framework and putting in place a more flexible and responsive regime for the future.

The Civil Aviation Bill has already made significant progress through Parliament, having successfully concluded Report stage in the House of Commons, and will shortly continue its passage through the House of Lords.

In light of this, it would be unrealistic to ignore that a new regime is on the near horizon which will form the basis for the next regulatory settlement due to come into effect on 1 April 2014. Progressing with the mandatory reference under the existing legislation is likely to introduce unnecessary costs and uncertainty into the process for the CAA, the Competition Commission, and the aviation sector, in a manner that would undermine the Government's objective of reducing unnecessary regulation. I have therefore decided to remove the mandatory Competition Commission references for price controls at these airports now.

The directions that I am issuing follow an informal consultation between 19 January and 29 February 2012 with industry and careful consideration of their responses. I am also publishing today [my letter to industry setting out my response to the issues raised in that consultation and my letter to the CAA](/publications/greening-20120516a).

I have asked South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive to lead the delivery of the vehicles and to sponsor the pilot in collaboration with Network Rail, Northern Rail and Stagecoach Supertram.

The pilot I am announcing today will allow us to determine the practical and operational issues of extending Tram Trains from the national network to on-street running and running trams and heavy rail vehicles safely over existing heavy rail infrastructure. It will also allow us to gauge passenger perception and acceptability of Tram Train.

The knowledge that we obtain from the pilot will enable us to understand the technical and operational challenges involved in this project so that the concept can potentially be rolled out elsewhere in the UK.

The pilot will see the introduction from 2015 of new Tram Train vehicles capable of using both light and heavy rail infrastructure, so providing continuous travel from Sheffield's Supertram network onto Network Rail's national rail network, as well as providing more capacity on the Supertram system itself.

The new vehicles will provide three services an hour operating from Parkgate Retail Park in Rotherham, travelling through Rotherham Central Station and joining up to the existing Supertram network at Meadowhall where the services will then continue onwards to Sheffield City Centre. The project is also expected to create 25 new driver jobs locally, plus around 10 additional jobs in maintenance and revenue protection.

The pilot will run for two years and alongside the additional capacity being provided for the Supertram system, is expected to cost  £58 million, including the cost of the vehicles and infrastructure changes.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120521a,Historic Vehicles MOT,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: Today I am announcing the Government's plan to exempt all vehicles of historic interest (vehicles manufactured prior to 1 January 1960) in Great Britain (GB) from statutory MOT test, as allowed under Article 4(2) of the EU Directive 2009/40/EC. I am also publishing the outcome of the consultation (with Government response) on our proposal to exempt historic vehicles from the MOT test which closed on 26 January 2012.

The EU Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, Chapter II, Exceptions, Article 4 states: ""Member States may, after consulting the Commission, exclude from the scope of this Directive, or subject to special provisions, certain vehicles operated or used in exceptional conditions and vehicles which are never, or hardly ever, used on public highways, including vehicles of historic interest which were manufactured before 1 January 1960 or which are temporarily withdrawn from circulation. Member States may, after consulting the Commission, set their own testing standards for vehicles considered to be of historic interest.""

Whilst the pre-1960 manufactured vehicles made up 0.6% of the 35.2m licensed vehicles in GB they were involved in just 0.03% of road casualties and accidents. Two-thirds of them are driven under 500 miles a year and their initial MOT test failure rate (10%) is only a third of that of post -1960 manufactured vehicles.

Following consultation, the Government has concluded that we should proceed with exempting all pre-1960 manufactured vehicles from the MOT test. The Government believes that the exemption will reduce regulatory burden on owners of historic vehicles, meet its Reducing Regulation agenda and the desire to remove unnecessary burdens. It will also bring the age of vehicles requiring the statutory MOT test in line with The Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) Regulations 1988, which already exempts unladen pre-1960 manufactured Heavy Goods Vehicles from the roadworthiness test. Owners of pre-1960 manufactured vehicles will still retain the option to do voluntary MOT test on their vehicles.

The outcome of [consultation with Government response can be found on the Department's website](/consultations/dft-2011-27/).

An amendment will be made to regulation 6 of The Motor Vehicles (Tests) Regulations 1981 to enable the MOT exemption. It is my intention that the changes come into force by 18 November 2012.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20120522a,Revising the charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock river crossing,"Written statement by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","## Revising the Charging Regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing

**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning)**: On the 30th June 2011, the Department for Transport launched a consultation on proposals to revise the road user charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing. The consultation closed on the 23rd September.

The Government had to make hard choices at the time of the 2010 Spending Review, and accepted the need to increase revenues from the Crossing to enable the continuing prioritisation of planned improvements.

The Department's proposal was that cash charge for cars would increase from £1.50 to £2.00 from late 2011, and then to £2.50 in spring 2012, and that prices for other vehicles would also increase at broadly proportionate rates. These increases were part of a strategy to both manage demand at the Crossing and to continue to prioritise short, medium and long term improvements at the Crossing.

On 24th November 2011, I informed the House that in recognition of the number of representations made, and to allow the Department time to carefully consider the responses further, there would be no increase in either 2011 or spring 2012 as set out in the consultation.

The Government remains committed to tackling the current and forecast traffic congestion at the Crossing in recognition of its strategic importance, its role in facilitating the movements of goods and people and its contribution to national and local economies.

The Department received over 1300 responses to its proposals for revising the charging regime at the Crossing. Following careful consideration of all the points made during that consultation I am today announcing the Department's conclusions and the actions it intends taking.

The Department has decided to keep the road user charging regime at the Crossing as part of its strategy to manage demand for its use, and also to allow the Department to delivery its strategy for future improvements. This includes the medium term measure of implementing free-flow charging technology at the Crossing in Autumn 2014. To achieve this, consultation on the necessary secondary legislation will begin in Autumn this year, followed by awarding the contract for customer charging and enforcement management services in Autumn 2013.

In terms of the charges, the Department intends to increase these in two successive steps, as originally proposed, but to introduce the first increase in October 2012 (after the Olympic period), and the second at the same time as implementation of new, free-flow charging technology at the Crossing, currently scheduled for October 2014.

In terms of the levels of increase, the Department intends to increase the level of the cash charge for cars by 50 pence in October 2012, and again by a further 50 pence in October 2014. The cash charges for other vehicle classes will rise by broadly proportional amounts.

Discounts offered to regular users of the Crossing who pay in advance through the electronic Dart-Tag system will remain, with the costs of the discounted crossing charge increasing at the same rate and at the same time as the increases for cash payments.

Delaying the increases until after September responds to views expressed in the consultation about the proposed timing of increases, particularly in relation to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and about adverse impacts on the national and local economies.

As promised, the Department will maintain the levels of discounts to those eligible through the Local Residents' Discount Scheme, and there will be no increases in the levels of the crossing charge for them. The Department is committed to ensure that the discount scheme for residents remains effective and easy to use, and I have asked my Department to undertake a full review of the scheme to ensure it provides suitable discounted benefits to local communities who are impacted by the Crossing.

One of our short term measures to improve the Crossing included the deployment of a charge suspension protocol which was trialled during 2011 by the Highways Agency. The Agency has reviewed the effectiveness of the suspension protocol, taking into consideration the views expressed during the consultation on charges and we will shortly announce the conclusions of that review.

Subject to the completion of the necessary Parliamentary processes, the Department intends to revise the road user charging regime as set out above. The full response to the consultation can be found on the [Department's website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-08/).

**The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** On 26 January (Official Report, col 26WS) I undertook to report back to the House after taking external advice on an appropriate figure for grant repayment by Liverpool City Council in order to assuage competition concerns sufficiently to withdraw the Department for Transport's objection to turnaround cruise at the City of Liverpool Cruise Terminal.

The grant condition precluding turnaround had originally been set in 2007 in order to avoid unfair competition with other UK ports, which had invested in facilities without grant support. Liverpool City Council had requested that the condition be lifted and it was agreed that a proportion of the grant be repaid.

I have now received this advice and have decided to accept the recommended figure of £8.8M as a lump-sum repayment, or a total of £12.6M if phased over 15 years. In my view this represents a fair outcome that addresses competition concerns while enhancing the benefits to secure which the grants were initially paid.

Final removal of the grant condition by DCLG will be dependent on securing State Aid clearance from the European Commission, which will now be sought. The Department will assist in that process.

On 24 February 2012, the Department received 53 bids to Tranche Two of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from 48 lead authorities.

Proposals were assessed against the criteria as published in the Guidance on the Application Process, which was published on 19 January 2011. Successful proposals were those judged to perform well against the twin objectives of supporting the local economy and facilitating economic development, while reducing carbon emissions. They were also scored on their potential to deliver wider social and economic benefits, to improve safety, to bring about improvements to air quality, or to promote increased levels of physical activity.

Proposals were required to demonstrate financial sustainability with benefits enduring beyond the life of the Fund, to incorporate a credible delivery plan, and to include a commitment to make a local contribution towards the overall costs.

In line with the published guidance, an assessment of value for money was undertaken. The Department is confident that the overall package of proposals approved in this second round represents high value for money.

I have decided to announce funding for 30 proposals in this round today, with a further announcement regarding the status of 18 more bids to be made soon. 26 proposals will be funded in full and a further 4 proposals will be funded in part. The list of decisions made today regarding Tranche 2 bids is attached.

On 20 December 2011, the Department received 13 business cases for larger projects (requiring up to  £50 million funding from DfT). I intend to announce by the end of June which of those authorities have been successful.

I am very pleased that all eligible local authorities across England have applied for funding to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, either as a lead bidder, or as a partner authority to a large project. The Fund has been well received by local government and I am confident that it will be effective in addressing the two key objectives of creating growth and cutting carbon.

Alan Cook, the non executive chairman of the Highways Agency, led this review and his report ""A Fresh Start for the Strategic Road Network"" was published in November 2011. I am very grateful to Alan for his work on the study, and to the many stakeholders who offered advice and supported this process.

Today I am publishing my response to this review. I am also publishing the terms of reference for the study which the Prime Minister has asked my Department and HM Treasury to carry out, into the feasibility of new ownership and financing models for the strategic road network. This will build on the evidence provided in Alan Cook's report on the efficiency savings which have been made in the regulated utilities, and will test whether similar savings can be made through a different structure for managing the road network. The study will develop options for bringing more private sector involvement into the strategic road network, generating increased investment and driving further efficiencies in the network.

  * [Roads Reform - A Fresh Start for the the Strategic Road Network: The Government Response and Feasibility Study Terms of Reference, 24 May 2012](/publications/roads-reform/)

Nevertheless, we do not need to wait for the conclusions of the feasibility study before making progress on a specific set of reforms as recommended by Alan Cook, which are both worthwhile in their own right and essential precursors to any future structural reform.

My announcement today constitutes the first stage in an ambitious integrated programme for reforming the road network to ensure that ultimately we deliver a more effective and efficient strategic road network, which enhances the experience of motorists and puts the road users and communities which rely on this network at its very heart.

I have carefully considered Alan's recommendations and solutions and my response sets out how the Government intends to take these forward in parallel with the feasibility study. I am accepting, in detail or in principle, many of the actions which Alan recommends that I or the Board of the Highways Agency should take. At this stage, the area where I am not progressing Alan's recommendation is on the question of changing the status of the Agency within the public sector. I do not propose to make decisions on the Agency's status ahead of the feasibility study concluding and the Government taking decisions on the future reform of the roads network.

In my response to Alan's report, I set out a programme of work to transform the Agency into a best in class executive agency by:

  * Delivering a long term strategy and setting an outcome performance specification for the strategic road network, providing far greater clarity about what Government wants, as well as a basis for consistent and transparent challenge to the Highways Agency to deliver against this specification.
  * Championing the road user. I am determined to ensure that the voice of the user is listened to and championed. I will be bringing a stronger 'consumer focus' to the Department's role, by developing our ability to test and understand the views and concerns of users and to respond to those through the setting of the performance specification.
  * A much smarter approach to planning through the production of route based strategies. These documents will set out investment plans to inform our decisions for the next spending review and will support much greater participation in planning for the network from local and regional stakeholders.
  * Work towards smarter financial relationships with Government .We are not accepting in full Alan's recommendation about funding certainty and ending annuality, but we do propose to work closely with the Highways Agency and HM Treasury to consider the evidence for embedding greater certainty and flexibility into the funding regime of the strategic road network. This will help to inform any future decisions we may make on changes to the funding regime in any operating or ownership model for the network.

In advance of the conclusions of the feasibility study on ownership models, this immediate programme of work will deliver real progress towards a better performing strategic road network, with a clear strategic purpose, transparent expectations on performance, locally grounded investments plans, and a real consumer-focused culture.

My response and the feasibility terms of reference can be found on the Department for Transport website and electronic copies have been lodged with the House library.

This follows up key commitments from the Government's Strategic Framework for Road Safety published in May 2011.

With careless driving, the current enforcement process is time consuming and inefficient. We are therefore proposing to make careless driving a fixed penalty offence and open to the offer of education training. We believe this will help the police to enforce against this offence more efficiently. It will also provide greater flexibility in dealing with those low level careless driving behaviours that fall below the threshold for a court summons, enabling the greater use of educational training.

We will also be consulting on raising the level of many motoring fixed penalty notices (FPN), including increasing the penalty levels for many (usually endorsable) road traffic £60 FPN offences to £90. We have broadened the scope of the measure and are consulting on other options including, increasing the levels for non-endorsable offences, motor insurance offences, and graduated fixed penalties - all by a similar proportion.

Most of these penalty levels have not been increased since 2000 and are lower than other fixed penalties such as for Disorder. This risks offences being perceived as minor infringements. In addition, increasing penalty levels will encourage the introduction of educational courses for other offences, such as, not wearing a seat belt and the proposed careless driving fixed penalty.

There are no proposals to make any changes to penalty levels for parking restriction FPN offences.

These measures will play an important role in improving road safety for all road users as well as maintaining compliance with motoring laws.

The consultation documents can be found on the Department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House library.

The Council reached a partial General Approach on two Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF)-related regulations: a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Connecting Europe Facility and a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation and exploitation of the European satellite navigation systems.

I made statements on both Regulations saying that while we supported what had been negotiated so far in the text, we could not formally support the draft Regulations ahead of the agreement on the overall MFF negotiations as this might prejudge the overall MFF budget.

On the proposal for a Regulation establishing the Connecting Europe Facility, I supported an Irish proposal that would allow co-funding for road schemes where there were isolated (rail) networks as defined in the TEN-T Regulation. I also stressed that our participation in the core corridors was subject to the provisions of Art 172 of the Treaty that require member state approval and would be kept under review until we saw the final requirements in the TEN-T Regulation before finalising our position.

The Council reached a General Approach on a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at European Union airports within a Balanced Approach and repealing Directive 2002/30/EC. I was able to welcome the general approach text, which would reassure the public that at the local and EU level we were taking noise management seriously.

The Presidency provided progress reports on two proposals to bring EU law in line with provisions of the 2006 (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention, noting some of the outstanding issues following official level discussions.

A policy debate was held on the Blue Belt Pilot Project which had been initiated under the Belgian Presidency to look at reducing administrative barriers to sea trade, especially in the area of customs formalities. The Presidency concluded that there was support for the Commission taking initiatives to follow up the project, including legislation, though there would need to be analysis first to ensure benefits would justify costs. I noted that there would need to be much greater clarity on benefits before any consideration was given to setting the project in a legislative context.

Under any other business, the Commission provided an update on the inclusion of aviation in the Emissions Trading System (ETS): Compliance with the 31st March emissions reporting deadline had been high, although Chinese and Indian airlines had refused to comply with the ETS following a direction from their respective administrations. The US Senate held a hearing on the ETS prohibition Bill on 6 June - DG Clima testified at the hearing. Discussions at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) continued, the next significant meeting would be at the end of June, when the ICAO Council would discuss market based measures. I stressed the need to continue to maintain a united EU position to opposition. I highlighted that what we want is a global deal, with a target and specific measures.

Also under other business, the Commission reported on delays in the introduction of the European Electronic Tolling Service (EETS) which should allow drivers to pay road tolls in any country with a single on-board unit and account. Finally, the Commission reported on the recent conference on piracy and maritime transport.

I also met with my French, Dutch and Italian counterparts to discuss EU and bilateral issues in the margins of the Council.

This is in addition to the £15 million support for cycle safety improvements within London announced by the Government in March.

This fund will provide capital support to improve safety at junctions identified as having a record of road incidents that have resulted in cyclists being killed or seriously injured.

The Department for Transport will now work in partnership with local authorities and the Cycling Stakeholder Forum - which brings together cycling groups, safety experts, local authorities and other interested parties - to identify and prioritise junctions. This process will use Department for Transport analysis of official accident data to highlight potential targets.

Further information on how the money will be allocated will be announced in the Autumn.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120626a,Regulation of Aviation Security,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening):** Today I am publishing a summary of responses to the Government's consultation on better regulation for aviation security, and announcing the Government's decision on taking forward the initiative.

The consultation document [Better Regulation for Aviation Security](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-21/dft-2011-21-consultation.pdf) set out proposals to modernise the regulatory regime for aviation security to bring it into line with better regulation principles, promote innovation and efficiency and ensure the best possible passenger experience. It proposed a move to an Outcome Focused Risk Based (OFRB) approach which would give operators the flexibility and responsibility to design security processes that deliver specified security outcomes, perhaps more focussed towards the needs of their passengers, rather than requiring them, as at present, to comply with prescriptive security requirements. It builds on the successful and similar approach that now applies in aviation safety regulation.

The move to an OFRB approach would be managed through the introduction of a Security Management System (SeMS) developed and operated by each responsible organisation. A SeMS is an organised, systematic approach to managing security which embeds security management into the day-to-day activities of the organisation.

We will begin with a series of SeMS pilots, starting at London City Airport once the Olympics have finished, in which industry operators will develop the SeMS approach and in so doing enhance their internal security cultures. The pilot at London City Airport will be concerned only with the organisation and governance of security at the airport, not with the security checks themselves, which will continue to be managed and delivered in the current way.

Once these pilots have been concluded, and we are satisfied that the SeMS process is sufficiently robust and will deliver its intended benefits, we shall look to roll it out generally across the industry. This will provide a sound basis for the development and piloting of the OFRB approach.

The consultation ran from 14 July until 7 November 2011. Some 116 responses were received, from a range of organisations and individuals in the aviation industry as well as from interested bodies. I am grateful to them for the time they took in responding and for their informed and constructive comments.

I am pleased to say that there was overwhelming support for the proposed new approach. In publishing the consultation the Government acknowledged that these are complex proposals which require further development. The responses have been helpful in clarifying some of the issues involved, including importantly the proposed timetable.

The consultation proposed that the new arrangements should be phased in over three years starting in April 2013. The Civil Aviation Bill, which is currently before Parliament, provides for various aviation security functions that are currently performed by the Department for Transport to be conferred on the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Subject to the date of Royal Assent, we are preparing for the CAA to take on those functions from April 2014. The OFRB proposals would represent a significant change in the approach to the regulation of aviation security. We have therefore decided that development and roll-out of SeMS is the right first step to take towards the roll-out of the OFRB approach. The CAA has been consulted and supports this decision. The conferring of functions on the CAA does not depend on this development being completed.

The summary report, with further information about our plans for implementing the new approach, will be available in the Libraries of both Houses and on the Department's website.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120627a,£266 million investment in local sustainable transport schemes,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am pleased to announce today that I am awarding a further [£266m to support authorities in delivering local economic growth whilst cutting carbon emissions](/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process/) from transport. This funding unlocks further local funding sources to deliver £460m investment in local sustainable transport schemes.

Today's announcement is the third and final instalment of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, which is now delivering over £1 billion investment in sustainable travel across England, and demonstrating that economic growth and carbon reduction go hand in hand. To facilitate today's announcements, I have secured an additional £40m for the Fund, on top of the original £560m allocation.

On 20 December 2011, the Department received 13 business cases for Large Projects for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund.

I have decided to announce £225m for 12 large projects today, and I have also reserved up to £5m funding for a small project from Tyne and Wear ITA, which my officials will progress with officers from Tyne and Wear during the coming weeks. The list of decisions made today regarding Large Projects is attached.

On 24 February 2012, the Department received 53 small project bids to Tranche 2. On 24 May 2012 I announced £113m to fund 30 small projects, and I am today committing a further £41m to fund 15 more. The list of decisions made today regarding the remaining Tranche 2 bids is also attached.

I am very pleased that every single eligible local authority across England has applied for funding to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, either as a lead bidder, or as a partner authority to a large project. The Fund has been well received by local government and I am confident that it will be effective in addressing the two key objectives of creating growth and cutting carbon.

All projects were assessed against published criteria. Successful projects were those judged to perform well against the twin objectives of supporting the local economy and facilitating economic development, while reducing carbon emissions. They also demonstrated potential to deliver wider social and economic benefits, to improve safety, to bring about improvements to air quality, or to promote increased levels of physical activity.

All large projects included a full economic appraisal based on the Department's WebTAG guidance. The vast majority of funded large projects offer at least high value for money, with several offering very high value for money.

The consultation recognised the need to modernise the way these services are delivered and to respond to the growing demand for more flexible public services.

Today I am announcing that DVLA will press ahead with its proposals to modernise its services. As a result of this decision the DVLA will centralise its enforcement operations by March 2013 and will close its 39 local offices by the end of 2013. While I recognise that a large number of respondents expressed concerns, I believe that many of these concerns can be mitigated and I am confident that this programme will result in modern, effective services delivering savings of £26m each year.

I am also announcing that DVLA will work to ensure that customers in Northern Ireland have access to the full range of vehicle services available to the rest of the UK. This will include on-line taxing of vehicles and introducing additional benefits such as retaining registration marks.

The DVLA will build on its successes in electronic delivery by providing more transactions online. Local businesses will act as intermediaries to offer motorists more convenient access to certain DVLA services through at least 4000 outlets nationwide compared to the current 39 DVLA local offices. The DVLA will ensure that alternative service channels will be available before offices close.

Many of the concerns arising from the consultation related to issues around potential degradation of services and uncertainty over the alternative channels. The DVLA has developed its proposals to address these concerns. Discussions with stakeholders have helped shape these proposals, which will provide the motor trade and individual motorists with a more efficient and effective service through a greater number of convenient, accessible channels.

I am grateful to all those who engaged in the consultation process as their views have helped to develop the proposals in a way that can ensure customer needs are met.

Today, I am publishing a package of documents, including an impact assessment and a formal response to the consultation. These documents provide more detail of the future services and will be available on the DVLA website and in the Library of the House.

I am committed to maintaining or enhancing current service levels for all motorists and the DVLA will continue to work with stakeholders to support their transition onto new channels.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120709a,Personal Independence Payment and eligibility for a Blue Badge ,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):** I am today publishing a [consultation document on Personal Independence Payment and eligibility for a Blue Badge](/consultations/dft-2012-30/). The consultation period closes on Tuesday 2 October 2012.

The Coalition Government is taking forward important reforms to the welfare system. One of these reforms will involve changes to Disability Living Allowance and will affect eligibility for a disabled person's parking permit or Blue Badge. About a third of all badges are currently issued to people who receive the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance. My Department is therefore consulting on the options we have for dealing with the impact of the changes. The consultation covers arrangements for England only.

I am committed to ensuring that the Blue Badge scheme continues to be focused on those people who will benefit most from the parking concessions that it offers, and that it is sustainable in the future. The Government has identified three main options for responding to the implementation of Personal Independence Payments. The three main options are:

  * Option 1 - no legislative link between eligibility for a Blue Badge and eligibility to Personal Independence Payment,
  * Option 2 - establishing a legislative link between Blue Badge eligibility and the enhanced mobility component of Personal Independence Payment,
  * Option 3 - establishing a legislative link between Blue Badge eligibility and those who score 8 points or more within the 'Moving Around' activity within Personal Independence Payment. This assesses a person's physical ability to get around.

The Government's preferred option is Option 3 as it would mean that eligibility for a Blue Badge would be most similar to the current scheme and the potential impacts of this option are minimal. We will, however, consider this in light of views and comments sent in as part of the consultation. The Government is also asking for other suggestions for other practical and sustainable solutions.

The consultation concludes on 2 October 2012. Personal Independence Payments will be introduced for new claimants aged between 16 and 64 from April 2013 onwards. It will begin to replace Disability Living Allowance for existing recipients aged between 16 and 64 from October 2013 onwards. Any consequential changes to the Blue Badge scheme will also be phased in and will affect existing badge holders when an existing badge expires and they need to apply for a new one.

A copy of the consultation document has been placed in the library of the House.

The responses, along with work done by my officials in conjunction with other stakeholders, highlighted the strategic importance of NATS to the UK and the far reaching implications of a sale at this time. These include the continued development of the Single European Sky agenda and the ongoing work on the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research Programme (SESAR).

In parallel I have considered the potential value that could be realised through a sale of the shares alongside the benefits from receiving dividends from a retained shareholding.

After considering these factors, I have concluded that it is in the best interests of the British taxpayer, the travelling public and the company itself to retain the Government's shares in NATS at this time.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20120710a,Transparency - Train Punctuality Information,"Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker)**: In line with the Government's transparency agenda, and the commitments made in the Command Paper 'Reforming our Railways: Putting the Customer First', additional information will from today be made available by the Office of Rail Regulation and Network Rail about the punctuality of train services.

In addition to the existing Public Performance Measure (PPM), which indicates the proportion of train services arriving at their destination within 5 or 10 minutes, for short and long distance services respectively, information will now be published on trains which are 'right time' at their final destination - that is, which arrive early or within a minute of the due time.

PPM is and will remain the Government's and industry's key measure of rail punctuality and reliability:

  * it recognises the different passenger expectations and operating practicalities between short and long distance services;
  * it incentivises the industry to ensure that the vast majority of services - significantly over 90% - get to their destination at or close to time; and
  * it gives the industry essential flexibility to manage minor operational disruption, which would not be possible with an absolute on time measure.

But the Coalition Government recognises that passengers want more information about their services, including whether they are actually on time, and that is why Ministers have asked the industry to develop plans to provide this. We welcome the positive response which it has now made.

As a first step, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) is today publishing annual statistics on right time performance at industry sector level - ie Long Distance, London and South East, and Regional (including Scotland), going back to 2001/02. Network Rail (NR) will from now on be updating these figures for each industry period, alongside the main PPM measure.

These figures show that, for the network as a whole in 2011/12, 69.8% of trains arrived 'right time', compared with 91.6% meeting the PPM target. This is a high level of performance by historical standards and represents a significant improvement over the last five years, compared with 62.7% right time and 88.1% PPM in 2006/07. Overall, the average delay incurred by passengers is now around 2 minutes.

Results of the Spring 2012 National Passenger Survey just published by Passenger Focus showed very high levels of satisfaction with rail travel in this country (Great Britain). Nationally the percentage of passengers satisfied with their journey overall was 83 per cent, and for punctuality and reliability it stood at 81 per cent.

Right time information is generated by existing industry signalling systems, but these were not designed for precise monitoring of time-keeping, and there is some uncertainty over the accuracy of the data at individual operator level, so ORR is commissioning an urgent independent study into this.

In the light of that study, it is intended that right time information will be published at operator level from October 2012. In addition, Network Rail announced on 28 June that it was making available real time information on the reliability of individual trains, making it possible to analyse train performance at a far more granular level.

This will put our railway in the forefront of the transparency agenda, providing more information on punctuality and reliability for passengers than any other European country.

A good deal of information is also published on other key transport modes in this country, and the Coalition Government is keen to see further progress on transparency over time.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/villiers-20120710a,Annual update on Crossrail,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","**The Minister of State for Transport (Theresa Villiers):** Crossrail is now moving firmly into its construction phase. A number of significant milestones have been achieved in the last twelve months. The purpose built Tunnelling and Underground Construction Academy was opened in East London last year and welcomed its first students in September 2011. Tunnelling began in May, with the first tunnel boring machine launched at the Royal Oak Portal in west London. Construction contracts for Paddington, Farringdon, Whitechapel, Tottenham Court Road and Liverpool Street stations have been awarded. The Canary Wharf station box structure is now complete. The Invitation to Negotiate for the Crossrail Rolling Stock and Depot contract was launched by Crossrail Limited on 28 February, with the first round of tenders due to be returned during late summer.

To reduce the number of lorry movements, excavated material from Crossrail's western tunnels has started to be transported directly from Royal Oak to Northfleet in Kent by rail. A former freight line from the North Kent Line has been completely reconstructed to enable freight train movements from London. Two-thirds of excavated material generated by tunnel, station and shafts construction will be taken to Northfleet and transferred by ship to create a new 1,500 acre nature reserve at Wallasea Island in Essex.

Network Rail is responsible for delivering improvements on the existing surface sections of the Crossrail route. The Overall Target Price for these works was approved in April 2012 and was within the £2.3bn funding envelope. Network Rail has also begun construction of the expanded Stockley Flyover in west London to enable higher frequency Crossrail trains to operate to Heathrow Airport.

Crossrail services are on schedule to be operational from 2018 with full services operating from late 2019. The Crossrail Board continues to forecast that the costs of constructing Crossrail will be within the agreed funding limits. We expect Crossrail to cost no more than £14.5billion.

During the passage of the Crossrail Bill through Parliament, a commitment was given that a statement would be published at least every 12 months until the completion of the construction of Crossrail, setting out information about the project's funding and finances.

In line with this commitment, this statement comes within 12 months of my last one which was published on 13 July 2011. The relevant information is as follows:

Total funding amounts provided to Crossrail Limited by the Department for Transport and Transport for London ('TfL') in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period (22 July 2008 to 29 May 2012).
£2,751,624,360

Expenditure incurred (including committed land and property spend not yet paid out) by Crossrail Limited in relation to the construction of Crossrail in the period 30 May 2011 to 29 May 2012 (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases).

Total expenditure incurred (including committed land and property spend not yet paid out) by Crossrail Limited in relation to the construction of Crossrail to the end of the period 22 July 2008 to 29 May 2012 (excluding recoverable VAT on Land and Property purchases).
£2,928,548,000

The Amounts realised by the disposal of any land or property for the purposes of the construction of Crossrail by the Secretary of State, TfL or Crossrail Limited in the period covered by the statement.

The numbers above are drawn from Crossrail Limited's books of account and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the update provided last year. The figure for expenditure incurred includes monies already paid out in relevant periods, including committed land and property expenditure where this has not yet been paid. It does not include future expenditure on construction contracts that have been awarded.

On 27 March 2012 I announced to the House the next steps of that programme. I also informed the House that we would be seeking public and private organisations to work in partnership with the DSA to identify and provide locations from which the practical car test could be delivered.

I am pleased to report that real progress has been made and there are proposals being developed for partnerships with Halfords Group PLC and Mantra Learning Limited. Subject to working agreements being finalised and suitable premises with driving test routes being identified, driving tests should be delivered, in the locations I have already announced, from premises of these organisations in the near future. These will be non exclusive arrangements and DSA may, in future, consider other partnering agreements to provide premises, which meet its criteria. Local agreements with the Fire and Rescue Service, particularly in areas not otherwise covered, are also being explored and there have also been discussions with several universities.

Significantly this use of property will be provided at no cost to DSA. Tests will continue to be conducted by DSA examiners.

DSA will evaluate the success of these arrangements and I will keep the House informed.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/greening-20120712a,Aviation Policy Framework,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Justine Greening)**: In March 2011, the Government launched a scoping exercise towards developing a new sustainable policy framework for UK aviation. I am grateful to the more than 600 organisations and individuals who responded. We have given careful consideration to their responses in preparing the [draft Aviation Policy Framework consultation document](/consultations/dft-2012-35), which I am publishing today.

The responses to the scoping exercise reflected a wide degree of consensus on aviation's significant economic contribution and its other benefits, that its global and local environmental impacts are real and need to be tackled effectively and that maintaining the UK's excellent international connectivity is critical. The consultation document sets out the Government's high level policy in each of these areas and seeks views on some of the measures we propose in support of our approach.

We clearly recognise the value of aviation as an important economic sector in its own right and as a key driver of UK economic growth. It contributes around £17 billion of economic output and employs over 220,000 workers directly and many more indirectly. And we recognise the strength of the UK's aviation connections which give us the third largest aviation network after the US and China and make London one of the best connected cities in the world with direct links to over 360 destinations worldwide, more than either Paris or Frankfurt.

The Government has a package of measures underway to improve the passenger experience at our airports and make the best use of existing capacity, as well as taking forward a process to address the UK's international connectivity needs in the medium and longer term.

First, we are improving efficiency at our borders. My Rt Hon Friend, the Home Secretary is reviewing the UK's visa regime, to improve the passenger experience and to ensure that our border policy supports our prosperity agenda whilst maintaining effective security. Any changes to the UK's visa regime will be implemented during the course of 2013. The Home Office has also brought forward the recruitment of 70 additional staff at Heathrow to provide additional flexibility to secure the border while dealing with increased passenger numbers. And it is looking at how we can improve the role of automation in the expedited clearance of passengers, linked to the development of a registered traveller scheme to replace the current IRIS scheme which has been extended.

We are improving reliability and reducing delay at Heathrow through the trial of measures introducing greater operational flexibility. If operational freedoms show clear benefits in terms of resilience, reducing delays and allowing planes to land more effectively, thereby reducing the impact of noise for residents under the flight path, then we will consult on making these benefits permanent.

We are taking forward other recommendations of the South East Airports Taskforce, such as airport performance charters which will set out the level of service that airlines and their passengers should expect, as well as new guidelines developed in a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) chaired industry group which will make the best use of existing capacity.

We are transforming the economic regulation of airports through our Civil Aviation Bill to promote passengers' interests. We propose to replace the current uniform approach to regulation - where designated airports are subject to mandatory five-year price caps - with a modern licensing regime where licence conditions can be tailored to the specific circumstances facing individual airports. By allowing for more proportionate regulation, the new regime also enables the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to take steps to reduce the degree or scope of economic regulation imposed on individual airports if they decide this would benefit passengers. The Bill will also ensure that airports can respond more flexibly to real-time events such as severe weather or volcanic ash and put in place a long-term framework for improving quality of service and investing in better infrastructure and facilities. The Bill is on track to receive Royal Assent by spring 2013 and we expect the new licensing regime to be implemented from April 2014.

We are improving surface access to airports with significant new investment. In total over this spending review period the Government is supporting investment of  £1.4 billion on rail and road schemes which will directly or indirectly benefit airports across the UK.

This includes a fleet of thirty new electric trains on the Stansted Express to London which entered service last year and a £53m upgrade of Gatwick Airport station with improved passenger facilities, an extra platform and more track and signalling by 2013 and a Regional Growth Fund contribution of £19.5 million for junction enhancements to be completed by 2014 which will improve access from the M1 to Luton Airport.

And the Metrolink extension to Manchester Airport is due to open in 2016 which will provide a tram every 12 minutes between Manchester Airport and Manchester city centre.

In the future, Luton and Gatwick will receive improved rail services through the Thameslink programme and we expect Heathrow passengers to benefit from Crossrail.

But we recognise that we need to go further now in enhancing the capability of UK airports, particularly in the South East. So today we are also announcing:

  * The commitment of up to £500m towards a western rail link to Heathrow, subject to a business case and conclusion of agreements with the aviation industry. This recognises the continued importance of Heathrow as our major international hub. Businesses west of the airport have been calling for this vital investment for many years. It will cut typically 30 minutes off the journey to Heathrow from the west of England and south Wales, with significant benefits for growing cities like Swindon, Bristol and Cardiff. The service could come into operation as early as 2021. I will shortly publish a rail investment strategy, which will recognise the importance of transport investment to the economy, including improving connectivity between cities and airports.
  * Proposals to further liberalise the UK aviation market to encourage foreign airlines to develop new routes by extending to Gatwick and Stansted the ability for foreign airlines to pick up passengers when flying to other destinations.
  * Our proposal to remove bilateral restrictions on air services on a case-by-case basis. This will mean open access to airports outside the South East for new air services, in order to facilitate inward investment in new routes and extra choice for business and passengers without necessarily having to secure reciprocal access for UK airlines to the airports of the other country.
  * Our commitment, building on the Olympics and the GREAT brand, to develop a new marketing package, working with BIS, UKTI, and others to market the benefits of flying to a range of UK airports and to target new carriers, particularly carriers in emerging markets such as Latin America, India and South East Asia.
  * That we will work with airports to explore, with the US authorities and others, the feasibility of US pre-clearance facilities being made available in the UK, which could improve the competitive offer airports operating such a scheme would be able to make.
  * That we will invite train companies to explore the potential of 'code-sharing' between flights and long-distance train services, to enhance competition between trains and domestic flights.
  * Our intention to identify options, within the EU legislative framework, aimed at ensuring that slots at our congested airports are used in the most economically beneficial way for the UK. The focus of this work is on seeking to optimise the functioning of the secondary trading market for airport slots. We expect to engage with key stakeholders later in the summer and publish a progress report in the autumn. We are also working with the EU, in the context of the Commission's proposals on reform of the rules on landing slots to secure measures to support UK regional connectivity, such as protecting the provision of air services between Northern Ireland and Heathrow.
  * Our support for the introduction of new rules by airport operators aimed at maximising the use of existing capacity at our busiest airports - for example, by limiting access to smaller planes.

In doing so, we recognise the very substantial efforts the aviation industry is making in continuing to invest and respond to the market.

For example, Heathrow and Gatwick are investing £5 billion and £1 billion respectively over the next few years in better infrastructure and Birmingham Airport will shortly begin constructing a £65 million runway extension which will increase the airport's scope to open new routes to long haul destinations.

Airlines are launching new routes to key emerging markets, such as British Airways who recently announced a new service to Seoul. China Southern Airlines is now flying from Heathrow to Guangzhou and Gatwick is showing its potential, for example with Air China's new service to Beijing.

These are positive developments and will help to maintain the UK's excellent international aviation connectivity in the short term. The Government recognises, however, that it must not only take steps for the short term but also address the issue of future airport capacity and we are committed to doing so.

Following our scoping exercise last year, our draft Aviation Policy Framework is the next step towards that and we welcome responses to this consultation. We will follow this, later this year, by issuing an open Call for Evidence inviting stakeholders to submit specific, evidence-based proposals for consideration in identifying the medium and long term steps needed to meet the Government's economic and environmental objectives for aviation. This is a structured process towards delivering a solution that is sustainable, not only economically and environmentally but also politically. The failure of successive governments to tackle this issue shows that we need to get it right this time. Success depends upon agreeing a solution that can be delivered regardless of the political cycle and that requires an objective evidence-based process which draws on the views of the full range of interested parties.

This is a vital project that will create jobs, drive economic growth and provide a solution to the capacity crunch facing our existing rail network. Work on the project continues apace and I will be publishing my preferred routes for the second phase of the project in the autumn.

Alongside January's decision I confirmed my intention to deliver a generous compensation package for those affected by the route which goes over and above the minimum required by law.

I am acutely aware of the impact that the proposals for HS2 are having on the property markets along the line of route from London to the West Midlands. The impacts on property are some of the most direct and personal effects of HS2. This is why we have committed to going above and beyond the statutory requirements for property compensation.

Developing the right property compensation package is complex as it needs to be fair to those living and working along the HS2 London to West Midlands route while recognising our broader responsibility to the taxpayer. It was clear from the responses to the consultation that we held last year that property compensation was an issue that generated a considerable amount of understandable concern from those affected. In addition, from personally dealing with the casework from the operation of the existing Exceptional Hardship Scheme, I recognise the range and complexity of issues that the property and compensation package for HS2 will need to deal with. This all means that it is imperative that we put in place the right package.

I am keen to consult as soon as possible to provide people with certainty but, given the nature of the issue and its implications for Phase 2 and work to assess stations and route options, it is clear to me that the detailed work to fully assess options means that we will consult on the property and compensation package for HS2 after Parliament returns from its summer recess in September. I understand that this delay will not be welcomed by individuals and businesses who had hoped to see an earlier resolution to the uncertainty surrounding HS2 property and compensation policies. However, this will enable the Government to put forward a comprehensive, practical and affordable package of property and compensation measures. I will be writing to those likely to be most directly affected by the project to explain this change.

Covering the period from 2014 to 2019, it describes my vision for a railway which is more financially and environmentally sustainable, which supports economic growth and which delivers for its passengers and freight customers.

I am confirming £16 billion of public support for rail in this period, which will support £9.4 billion of infrastructure enhancement. £5.2bn of this has previously been committed, including Thameslink, Crossrail and electrification of the Great Western Main Line and in the North West and Yorkshire. The additional £4.2bn includes:

  * A new Electric Spine - a passenger and freight corridor linking the core centres of population and economic activity in the East and West Midlands and Yorkshire with the South of England, which includes electrifying the Midland Main Line.
  * Further targeted electrification alongside this, including the Great Western Main Line from Cardiff to Swansea and the Welsh Valleys; between Micklefield and Selby in Yorkshire and between Walsall and Rugeley in the West Midlands.
  * Increased rail capacity for commuters, with over £700 million to be invested on the most congested routes in London and the South east and over £400 million for other cities, including completing the Northern Hub that will link key Northern cities bringing clear benefits to Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester Leeds and Sheffield. Taken with Crossrail, this will provide for 120,000 additional commuting trips per day into London in the morning peak and 20,000 into our other major cities.
  * Further investment on Great Western Main Line, including at Bristol and Oxford Stations as well as additional track capacity on the approaches to Bristol.
  * Over £900 million investment in funding for smaller schemes to improve:
    * stations, including accessibility so that everyone can use the railways;
    * the current strategic rail freight network;
    * passenger journey times and reliability.

Today's announcement represents another historic landmark in the regeneration and modernisation of Britain's railway. This Government's vision for the railways is clear - a railway system that is faster, more reliable, less crowded, and more green.

Just as we are dealing with the budget deficit, so we are also determined to deal with the massive infrastructure deficit we inherited. Rail is just one part of an unprecedented programme of transport investment this Government has put in place to drive growth and job creation in the UK economy. We are building HS2, investing £1bn in strategic road schemes and supporting 56 local road schemes, as well as supporting light rail and bus projects.

Previous governments have underinvested in rail. We will not repeat those mistakes. This is a government with a long term vision for a modern and efficient rail system that supports growth and improves competitiveness.

The Penfold Review examined various development consents, additional to planning permission, which developers must apply for. It identified measures the Government could take to minimise the burden of complying with and administering these consents, while maintaining the essential benefits that they protect.

We propose to permit applications for a stopping-up or diversion order to be submitted at the same time as applying for planning permission, whereas under existing legislation the developer can only apply after securing planning permission, and are consulting on options for devolving decision-making to the local authority level.

These measures were committed to in the 2011 Autumn Statement and will help to deliver the Government's growth agenda, by removing unnecessary burdens faced by businesses, speeding up the application process and removing unnecessary bureaucracy. They will play a useful role in encouraging investment and therefore growth in local communities.

Most of the policy options in the consultation will require primary legislation to amend the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as it applies to England. Subject to the outcome of the consultation, we intend to deliver this through the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill.

The consultation document, including impact assessment, will be available in the Libraries of both Houses and on the Department's website.

The Fuel Quality Directive (articles 1 and 7a(2)) requires that suppliers of fuels used in non-road mobile machinery should be obliged to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas intensities of the fuels they supply. Our preferred approach for implementing this requirement of the Directive is to amend the current RTFO Order 2007. However, given concerns about the sustainability of some biofuels, it is important that this change does not at this point result in an increase in the absolute volume of biofuel supplied in the UK.

Moreover, following concerns raised during consultation on engine compatibility and storage issues relating to biofuel used in non-road mobile machinery, we have, as announced previously, delayed making this change immediately so as to give industry and transport users time to prepare in terms of infrastructure and information. The requirement will come into force in April 2013. We understand the need for gas oil users to have accurate information on biofuel content. We hope the delay will give them time to engage with gas oil suppliers to ensure that biofuel-free gas oil will be available. DfT Guidance on improving the flow of information between non-road mobile machinery users and fuel suppliers is available at the following link:

This aims to ensure bus and coach passengers have rights similar to those using other modes of transport.

The Regulation, which mainly applies to bus and coach journeys over 155 miles (250km), lays out the responsibilities of operators and terminal owners in the case of delays, cancellations, accidents and other issues affecting passengers, including disabled passengers and passengers with reduced mobility.

The public consultation will offer the chance for those affected by this EU Regulation to put forward their opinions on domestic enforcement measures, the use of available exemptions and the designation of terminals served by long-distance services where specific assistance has to be provided to disabled people and people with reduced mobility.

I believe that the approach outlined in the consultation strikes the right balance between passenger protection and operator competitiveness. I look forward to receiving responses from interested parties.

","**The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mike Penning):** The Department has today published a consultation paper on the future of the Vehicle Identity Check (VIC) Scheme.

The purpose of the VIC scheme is to deter the crime of vehicle ringing. Typically, this involves the theft of a car often of significant value, which is then given the identity of a similar car (make, model, colour etc) which has been the subject of an insurance write-off. The written-off car is obtained cheaply; its identity (VIN and registration numbers) is then transferred to a higher value stolen car which, now apparently genuine, can be sold at market price.

Since the introduction of the VIC scheme in April 2003, around 717,000 checks have been undertaken and 38 confirmed ""ringers"" detected, at a cost of around £30m to the motorist. About 75% of the checks were undertaken on cars which were 7 years or older, written-off because the cost of even small repairs was greater than the very low market value of the vehicle, often meaning that the cost of the check fell on the less well-off members of society.

Although it is felt that the scheme has become, unintentionally, an unnecessary burden to many honest motorists, the Police feel that it is still the only deterrent to ""ringers"". The scheme also enables vehicle purchasers to be aware that the vehicle they are considering purchasing has previously been a write-off and confirms that the vehicle identity has been checked and therefore provides some protection against purchasing a stolen vehicle.

I intend to consult on whether to retain, re-scope or abolish the scope of the VIC scheme in a move to explore whether fewer vehicles can be checked in the future in order to remove unnecessary burden on law-abiding citizens, without jeopardising prevention of vehicle ringing.

The consultation documents can be found on the Department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House library.

Following a rigorous process of challenge, stakeholder discussion and public consultation, I am now pleased to be able to announce the results.

The Department put forward every secondary regulation relating to rail transportation for public discussion under the rail transport Red Tape Challenge. 198 of these were judged still to be live with a further 23 being identified as already ""lapsed or spent"". Of these 221, I propose to scrap, merge, simplify, amend or improve 88 (40 per cent).

The detailed breakdown I propose is:

Keep Improve Scrap Moved*

Number
129
28
60
4

Percentage
58%
13%
27%
2%

* Moved regulations predominantly relate to another Red Tape theme and will be resolved in a different part of the Challenge.

Amongst the measures being pursued, we intend to:

  * harmonise and simplify the process for obtaining an operating licence;
  * reduce regulatory burdens and costs on historic cableways;
  * merge a number of instruments to make regulations easier to understand; and
  * remove a significant number of lapsed or redundant instruments.

The [full list of regulations, including further information on the actions we are intending to take](/consultations/gov-20111110), is available on the Department's website.

Overall, this represents an important step forward in removing unnecessary regulatory burdens. Some elements of this programme will mark a major shift in the way the Department does business.

The outcomes also need to be viewed against the backdrop of the Government's wider efforts to put an end to the micro-management that occurred under the last Government in relation to matters such as franchise management. Both our franchise reform programme and our Command Paper ""Reforming Our Railways: Putting the Customer First"" seek to transfer more decisions from Whitehall to the professionals who run our railways as part of our efforts to deliver a more financially sustainable and customer-focussed railway.

The Department is already implementing the results of the [Roads Transport Red Tape Challenge](/consultations/gov-20110520) and Aviation Transportation, the final transport theme, is now open for public comment until 26 July.

On 29 May, the consultation responses were made available online. Subsequently, when it became clear that a small number of responses had not been published, my Department and HS2 Ltd reviewed how the consultation responses had been processed.

This review identified that 413 responses, amounting to less than one per cent of the 55,322 responses received in total, had not been included in the part of the consultation response assessment carried out by the Government's independent response analysis consultants, Dialogue by Design. The results of this analysis were summarised in their report published alongside my announcement of 10 January (High Speed Rail: Investing in Britain's Future - Consultation Summary Report). This report formed just one of the elements supporting my decisions, alongside other evidence including analysis of issues raised in consultation responses carried out by my Department and HS2 Ltd, as well as engagement with the public, MPs and other stakeholders through roadshow events, seminars, visits and meetings.

Of the 413 responses identified, six had been incorrectly marked as duplicates by Dialogue by Design. The remaining 407 were amongst those sent in by email to my Department rather than via the direct channels set out in the consultation document and were unintentionally not forwarded to Dialogue by Design for analysis.

My Department commissioned a supplementary analysis from Dialogue by Design which concluded that these responses ""do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report"". Inclusion in the original analysis would not have changed the substance of Dialogue by Design's findings, nor affected the considerations which informed me in taking my decisions following the consultation.

All affected respondents will be contacted with these details.

Bids were received from Abellio InterCity West Coast Limited - NV Nederlandse Spoorwegen, First West Coast Limited - FirstGroup plc, Keolis/SNCF West Coast Limited - Keolis SA and SNCF, Virgin Trains Limited - Virgin Group Holdings Limited.

The new franchise is planned to begin operation on Sunday 9 December 2012. The franchise will operate for a core term of 13 years and 4 months, with an option to be extended to operate for up to 15 years. The winning bid from First West Coast Limited provides for a premium of £5.5 billion NPV over the core franchise term.

The West Coast Main Line is one of the most important intercity rail passenger routes in the country and it is also a valuable public asset. Over the last decade and more, taxpayers have invested £9 billion to upgrade the infrastructure. It is a profitable franchise for the current operator and after significant public investment in the line the Government is rightly seeking to get a substantial return for passengers and taxpayers.

The First West Coast bid provides: more trains on the route, with 12,000 extra seats per day provided by 11 new 6 carriage electric trains from December 2016 (in addition to the 106 extra Pendolino carriages currently being introduced); refurbishing the existing Pendolino and Voyager train fleets, more capacity on services between Birmingham and Scotland, and faster journey times between London Euston and Glasgow; new services to Blackpool, Bolton and Shrewsbury, subject to approval of the ORR; lower Standard Anytime fares over the first two years; £22m in station improvements; Oyster-style smart ticketing; and, for the first time in an intercity franchise, better customer satisfaction as measured by the National Passenger Survey.

When a new franchise begins, employees of the current franchise operator, including drivers, guards and back office staff will be transferred to the new operator, protected by TUPE regulations. All of the rolling stock used by the incumbent operator will also transfer across.

Taken together, I believe that the commitments in First West Coast's bid represent significant improvements for passengers and will provide a good return for the taxpayer.

As a result of a legal challenge, which the government intends to defend robustly, we have not yet signed the contract with First West Coast, and consequently the competition remains live. I cannot give the full commercial details of the winning bid, or indeed of the other bids. Nor is it usual or appropriate - once litigation proceedings have commenced - for the Government to comment on the detail of that, other than to say that our legal advisers are fully engaged in addressing and responding to those proceedings.

I will continue to keep the House updated, subject to the constraints of legal or commercial privilege.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20120907a,increasing-international-competitiveness-of-uk-airlines-and-airports,"Written statement by the Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","**The Secretary of State for Transport (Patrick McLoughlin):** International connectivity is vital to support economic growth. This Government has made clear that its priority is returning this country to sustainable economic growth and our aviation networks and infrastructure have an important role to play.

The UK is an island nation dependent upon its transport links to the rest of the world for its prosperity. The aviation industry in the UK is extremely successful. It is a significant economic sector employing 220,000 directly and supporting many more indirectly and it contributes more than  £16 billion of economic output. 35% of UK non-EU trade by value enters or leaves the country by aeroplane. Importantly the industry also provides this country with the global connections which our businesses need to sell their products abroad and which inward investors to the UK demand.

The Government recognises the importance of aviation to the UK. It is taking forward the Civil Aviation Bill to reform the economic regulation of airports to further the interests of passengers and create a better environment for investment. It is implementing the recommendations of the South East Airports Taskforce, including a trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow airport to improve reliability and reduce delay. In July the Government published a draft Aviation Policy Framework (APF) for consultation; a framework which will set the high-level policy parameters within which any new proposals for airport development may be considered. The final APF will be adopted by the end of March 2013. Alongside the draft APF the Government announced a number of short term measures to deliver operational improvements and boost economic growth within existing airport capacity constraints including £500 million towards a western rail link to Heathrow, a review of the UK's visa regime and the recruitment of 70 additional border staff at Heathrow.

Today the UK is amongst the best connected countries in the world. Our airports, particularly those in the South East, deliver direct flights to over 360 destinations, including those of greatest economic importance. London has more flights to more destinations than any other city in Europe. More flights to the important trading centres like New York, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The Government is determined to deliver a solution which will continue to provide that connectivity in the short, medium and longer term.

This is a very difficult debate, but the reality is that since the 1960s Britain has failed to keep pace with our international competitors in addressing long term aviation capacity and connectivity needs. Germany, France and the Netherlands have all grown their capacity more extensively than the UK over the years, and so are better equipped, now and in the future, to connect with the fast growing markets of emerging economies. The consequences are clear. Our largest airport and our only hub airport - Heathrow - is already operating at capacity. Gatwick, the world's busiest single runway airport, will be full early in the next decade, while spare capacity at Stansted airport is forecast to run out in the early 2030s.

The Government believes that maintaining the UK's status as a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long term international competitiveness. But the Government is also mindful of the need to take full account of the social, environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport capacity.

Successive Governments have sought to develop a credible long term aviation policy to meet the international connectivity needs of the UK. In each case the policy has failed for want of trust in the process, consensus on the evidence upon which the policy was based and the difficulty of sustaining a challenging long term policy through a change of Government. The country cannot afford for this failure to continue.

The Government has asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Commission tasked with identifying and recommending to Government options for maintaining this country's status as an international hub for aviation.

The Commission will:

  * examine the scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK's position as Europe's most important aviation hub; and
  * identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term.

In doing so, the Commission, will provide an interim report to the Government no later than the end of 2013 setting out:

  * its assessment of the evidence on the nature, scale and timing of the steps needed to maintain the UK's global hub status; and
  * its recommendation(s) for immediate actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next five years - consistent with credible long term options.

The Commission will then publish by the summer of 2015 a final report, for consideration by the Government and Opposition Parties, containing:

  * its assessment of the options for meeting the UK's international connectivity needs, including their economic, social and environmental impact;
  * its recommendation(s) for the optimum approach to meeting any need;
  * its recommendation(s) for ensuring that the need is met as expeditiously as practicable within the required timescale; and
  * materials to support the Government in preparing a National Policy Statement to accelerate the resolution of any future planning application(s).

A decision on whether to support any of the recommendations contained in the final report will be taken by the next Government.

The Government intends this independent Commission to be part of a process that is fair and open and that takes account of the views of passengers and residents as well as the aviation industry, business, local and devolved government and environmental groups. We would like, if possible to involve the opposition as part of our work alongside Sir Howard to finalise the arrangements for the Commission. I will provide Parliament with further details on the full membership of the Commission and the terms of reference for its work shortly.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20100615,Speech to London First,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you for that kind introduction Adrian and thank you for inviting me to make a contribution to tonight's proceedings.

It's an absolute pleasure to be here - and for two reasons.

First, I get to make one of my very first speeches as Transport Secretary to an expert audience, at an important event- so no pressure there.

And second, I get a chance to a say a big thank you for all that you do.

London First and its members make a real and positive difference to our Capital and our country - your commitment and sheer hard work play a huge part in communicating the message that Britain is very definitely open for business.

London First is always listened to and definitely taken seriously.

And, at the risk of making her blush, one of the keys to London First's success is right here tonight - Jo Valentine.

Take it from me - nobody lobbies on behalf of London's business community quite like Jo.

In fact, while I was Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Jo spent so much time knocking on my door and phoning me up that, at one stage, I felt as if I was being stalked.

If they make lobbying an Olympic sport in time for the 2012 Games then Jo will definitely be in the frame for a gold medal.

Jo - it was a pleasure working with you and London First in opposition and I look forward to doing so in government.

## The Government's wider agenda

I'm conscious that I have the privilege of being the first Cabinet Minister to address this organisation since the General Election.

The election was historic in every sense of the word. And its end result is a coalition government united by a common determination to tackle the fiscal crisis we inherit and a shared vision of Britain's road back to prosperity.

So, before I move on to deal with the specific issue of transport, I want to briefly talk about the key components of the Government's wider agenda.

Our first goal is to restore balanced and sustainable growth - so of course that means getting the public finances back on track. That's our a top priority.

But it also means supporting enterprise, getting credit flowing and rebuilding business confidence so that the private sector can generate the growth that will get us back on track.

And, because we want to protect our environment, as well as strengthen our economy, we regard a low carbon future as the only viable future for Britain.

We believe in a new politics where people can hold ministers and public services to account - where much greater transparency is the norm and where that transparency itself becomes a driver of behaviour change in the way Government works.

But we also want this country to be a place where people think about their obligations as well as their rights.

So, as well as protecting civil liberties and modernising our democracy, we'll promote individual and social responsibility as the building blocks for a better Britain.

An economy that's strong and stable; an environment that's clean and green, a society that's free and fair- that's the essence of the Coaltion programme for Government: the shared vision we are determined to make a reality.

## A radically changed economic landscape

But all of our work, all that this Government hopes to achieve is set against the backdrop of the inherited fiscal crisis - a crisis that has radically changed the economic landscape.

The legacy of debt is recognised by the theme of this very event.

Indeed, as Jo said in her recent Evening Standard article, the deficit is - ""the biggest challenge facing the Prime Minister and his team.""

As a Government, as a country, we have no option but to confront the debt crisis head on. And deal with it now.

This is the only way to restore confidence in our economy, protect our credit rating and help keep interest rates lower for longer to support the recovery.

If we ignore the debt crisis, if we act like a by-stander government hoping that it will go away of its own accord, then the consequences will be as stark as they are certain - no growth and no recovery.

And that's why we are acting and acting immediately.

The Prime Minister has consistently said that we will cut the fiscal deficit in a way that protects the poorest and most vulnerable in our society - so compassion and fairness are at the core of our approach and we will strive to win hearts and minds and take people with us as we embark on this Herculean task.

Never-the-less, getting the deficit down, and keeping it down, will require hard choices and tough decisions.

Some will be deeply unpopular. Of that I have absolutely no doubt. But we will not shrink from taking them because, to do otherwise would lead us to disaster.

We've already laid out our plans to achieve over £6 billion of savings this year - for example, through a recruitment freeze, reducing the costs of QUANGOs, renegotiating contracts with major suppliers across government and taking an axe to discretionary spending.

And, my Department is playing its full role in delivering these savings - £683 million worth to be exact.

And that is just a first instalment. The emergency budget next week will set out further reductions in public spending for the years ahead.

Sir Alan Budd's report yesterday, with its sobering review of Britain's real growth prospects over the next few years will provides an independent forecast against which the Chancellor's budget will be framed: a much needed move to evidence-based policy making.

## London - the beating heart

There is a new economic reality and all of us, government and business, will have to adapt to it and work within it.

But, in these times of challenge and change, one thing is certain, one thing remains constant - London is the beating heart of our national economy.

And transport is London's lifeblood - a vital support to its future prosperity.

And, if proof were needed of the crucial role played by this City and its transport networks then it can be found in London First's latest research.

The ""Greater Returns"" report you've just launched is a timely one, with a Budget and a Spending Review fast looming, focusing as it does on how we should prioritise and where we should invest.

It's an important contribution to the debate about the future of our economy and our transport system. I will study its findings with interest - and I hope my colleagues at the Treasury will do the same.

## Working smarter

So we need to protect and enhance London's transport infrastructure. But we cannot bury our heads in the sand and ignore the wider fiscal climate.

London has already shared in the in-year efficiency savings in the Transport budget. And if budgets are further reduced in the Spending Review, London will, of course, have to take its share of the burden. We are all in this together.

The challenge for all of us - a challenge our best businesses face daily - is to absorb budget reductions through efficiency gains, not by cutting services and projects.

That means working smarter and ending waste, improving productivity and prioritising spending. In short, doing more with less.

The scale of the challenge is awe-inspiring:

Every day over 24 million journeys are made in the Capital.

Every month more than 9 million passengers pass through London's airports.

And every year 53 million tonnes of cargo are loaded or unloaded at the port of London - making it the country's second busiest port and a vital gateway to the global superhighway of the seas.

And all the graphs point inexorably upward.

So I know that, whether it's investment in airports and seaports, or increasing road and rail capacity, every section of London's business community will have its own priorities and favoured projects.

But I also know that you will understand better than any audience the need for an utterly rigorous approach to the spending of scarce taxpayer funding.

That demands we do three things:

First, get the most out of what we already have by sweating public assets - just as a good business will sweat private ones. So, for example, we have to actively manage our roads, targeting modest investments to clear bottlenecks; maximising the value of networks.

Second, apply a rigorous cost-benefit analysis to infrastructure projects and proposals, targeting taxpayers' money where it really makes a difference;

And third, ruthlessly controlling costs of the projects we are undertaking - relentlessly value-engineering, risk managing - leaving no stone unturned in pursuit of value for taxpayers' money.

And that brings me to Crossrail and Thameslink.

Both vital projects for London. Both supported by business - and both supported by this Government.

As a practical sign of that support I paid a visit to the Crossrail station site at Canary Wharf earlier today.

And I'm pleased to report that, not only is it an impressive feat of engineering; it is on time, and on budget.

I believe that Crossrail and Thameslink can be growth generators, not only for London, but for the South East and the whole of the UK.

But they need to be tested and re-tested at every stage and along every mile so that we engineer costs down and drive value for money up.

And let me be clear - this is not just a fiscal responsibility. In the current public spending climate, it's a moral obligation.

These transport projects have an able and articulate advocate in the shape of the Mayor.

In standing up for the people, and the businesses, of London Boris has proved himself a city-wide innovator, as well as a city-wide champion.

So I will work closely with the Mayor - as well as with Transport for London and Network Rail - to make sure we achieve those efficiency savings and get the best return for every last penny of public money invested in Crossrail and Thameslink.

But, London's transport infrastructure doesn't begin and end with these two projects - as important as they are.

Just yards away from where we are now we have the magnificence of St Pancras as an example of what has been achieved, and next to it, Kings Cross, well advanced with a bid to rival it as a gateway to this great city.

Less visible, but every bit as important, is London Underground's major programme of investment in the tube.

Again, as well as looking to the Mayor to be relentless in pursuit of efficiency savings in this programme, I'll be working with him and his team to make sure the new arrangements for Tube Lines demonstrate continuing value for money for taxpayers and farepayers.

I'll also be engaging constructively with Boris on a range of other issues that matter to the communities and businesses of our City - from tackling the scourge of over-running street-works, to promoting cleaner and greener travel, to ensuring the 2012 Olympics is a window to the world for all that is great about London and Britain.

Another challenge of our time is finding innovative ways of funding capital expenditure and attracting investment.

So I'm especially pleased that the Mayor is doing just that by obtaining £25 million of sponsorship from Barclays for his cycle hire scheme and the new cycle super highways. In fact, I'm so impressed that I may yet be lured to ride one.

Innovation, fresh thinking and partnership working are in the DNA of the business community.

So I'm sure many of you here this evening will have ideas and proposals to put to us as we seek to tackle the crisis.

That's something I welcome. And rest assured - I'll have an open mind as well as an open door.

## Heathrow - better not bigger

Something else we feel strongly about is that politicians should keep their promises. That's the only way we'll rebuild trust in politics.

During the election, both of the partners in the Coalition made a manifesto promise to scrap the third runway.

So, when I took up this job, day one, decision one was the cancellation of the third runway at Heathrow.

Now I accept this hasn't been greeted with universal acclaim by business community - although it is also not true that all businesses favoured the runway project.

But I believe we have made the right judgement call, for the right reasons.
And let's be clear - this decision does not mean we are anti-aviation.

You have a Secretary of State, a Department and a Government that understands fully, and appreciates absolutely, the social and economic benefits of aviation.

But we also listened to those who would be most affected by the original proposals for expanding Heathrow - as well as those for Gatwick and Stansted.

And we carefully considered the wider environmental impacts in the context of our - and our predecessors' - clear commitments on cutting climate change.

So, while that decision marks the closure of a chapter in the aviation debate, it also marks the opening of an important new one.

Because I believe that what our Capital, our country and our companies need is a Heathrow that's better, not bigger.

A Heathrow that is properly linked to our planned nationwide high speed rail network. So that 'modal shift' can become a reality for domestic and even some short-haul European flights.

But it doesn't end there.

A better Heathrow should offer a world class service to the travelling public and to business users.

That's the reason we outlined our important new plans in the Queen's Speech to drag the current model of airport economic regulation out of its outdated framework, and into the 21st century where it belongs.

When you travel, your first encounter with any city is often through its airport.

And, when you arrive in London, the airport should say something positive about the kind of city this is. It should leave people thinking what a great place to visit, what a great place to do business.

What it should not say is ""never ending queues, time wasting delays and second rate service"".

I believe our Airport Economic Regulation Bill will help ensure that this country's airports always say the right thing and leave the right memory.

In the spirit of raising the game at our airports, earlier today I announced the establishment of a South East Airports Taskforce made up of key players from across the industry.

Chaired by my Minister of State, Theresa Villiers, it's job will be to write that new chapter in our aviation history, exploring how to get the most out of existing airport infrastructure and improve conditions for all users. And I am delighted to be able to tell you that the group will include a representative from London First.

## Concluding remarks

Tonight I've talked about this Government's wider agenda; I hope I've given you a flavour of our broad vision for the sort of transport system we want to build; and I've spoken about the consequences of the radically changed economic landscape we now find ourselves in.

But, before I conclude, I want to leave you with one last observation - and it's about this great metropolis.

Because, the real question is not whether London, like the rest of the country, and indeed much of the world, faces challenging times.

The real question is whether London has the people and the businesses, the capacity and the character to meet those challenges head on and beat them hands down.

And I have no doubt whatsoever that the answer to that question is an unequivocal Yes.

There are always things we could do better; there's always progress to be made.

But let's not sell this City, or the people who live and work in it, short.

London has advantages that other major cities around the world can only dream of:

  * The language
  * The time zone
  * The sophistication of our business services
  * The scale and breadth of our financial sector
  * The global reputation of our legal system
  * The unparalleled cultural life of our city.

I am absolutely not complacent. But fate and history have dealt London a winning hand. If we lose the game it will not be the fault of the cards we hold.

But, a world class city needs world class transport.

I know that's your ambition for London.

Tonight I came here to tell you that it's also mine - and it's one that, by working together and by working smarter, we can deliver.

Over the coming years, how we respond to the fiscal crisis; how we invest our scarce resources; how we rebuild a sustainable and diverse economy; all of these things will determine whether our city retains its place at the top of the world's premier league. And I certainly didn't go into Government to preside over a relegation.

The challenges will be great - but I know we will rise to them and ensure that London remains the vibrant heart of a dynamic and prosperous Britain.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20100707,Speech for Rail Freight Group Annual Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","It's a pleasure to be here to give my first major speech as Rail Minister to your Annual Conference.

When I took on the transport brief in Opposition there was a truth I came to learn very quickly - rail freight matters.

It matters for our economy and our prosperity.

It matters for producers and consumers, importers and exporters.

And it matters for our environment.

And I pay tribute to the work of the Rail Freight Group and its chairman putting the case for your industry with clarity, skill and determination.

Ladies and gentlemen, there are many good reasons why we want rail freight to grow in the years ahead.

The facts will be familiar to this audience but it bears repeating that rail freight produces five times less CO2 per tonne-kilometre than road haulage.

Add to that the benefits to be gained by taking lorries off our congested road network with the traffic flow and road safety benefits that brings and you have a good case for promoting the transfer of freight from roads to rail.

So rail freight is an important part of our vision for the future of transport.

One of the many reasons why the Coalition supports high speed rail is the benefits it will bring by releasing more paths for freight on our existing railways for example on the WCML to the Midlands and beyond.

And although the proposed new high speed lines are viewed principally as passenger focused we expect the lines to be designed to make them freight capable as well.

But the broader question that needs to be addressed is how best can the new Government provide the right conditions for rail freight to grow and flourish and capture market share from the roads?

The first and arguably the most important strand of Government policy which is relevant here is one that goes well beyond the transport sector.

I am speaking of course, of the very difficult work we are undertaking to tackle the deficit, put the economy on a sound footing and relieve the burden of red tape and regulation on the business community as a whole.

There will be pain in the months and years to come as we seek to grapple with the devastating crisis in the public finances we inherited from our predecessors.

But painful as it will be, it's the only way to secure the economic stability needed for your industry and your customers to invest and flourish in the way needed to create jobs and revive prosperity.

In the run-up to October's Spending Review, we are looking at every area of departmental expenditure for affordability and value for money including rail.

I am well aware of how strongly the industry supports the retention of the mode-shift revenue grant and the Freight Facilities Grant programme.

I'm afraid, for the moment, I can't give any promises on the future of these grants.

It would be unwise of me to do so while work continues on the difficult task of preparing for the Comprehensive Spending Review.

However, I can confirm that we have agreed the revenue grant budget for the 2010/2011and 2011/2012 financial years and the quarterly bid rounds will continue for grant applications until then.

Secondly, we need to get the balance right between the interests of passengers and freight.

I promised this in Opposition and I'm determined to live up to that promise in Government.

But whether one is talking about passengers deciding between the train and the car or businesses deciding whether to move their goods by road or rail, we need a railway that's more accountable and better incentivised to deliver high quality services for users.

If we're to deliver that, we need an infrastructure provider that is responsive to customer concerns.

So the third means of improving the climate for rail freight that I'd like to look at today is reform of Network Rail.

In my view the status quo is simply not acceptable.

For example, it is a matter of serious regret that Network Rail pressed ahead with paying massive bonuses to it staff despite the concerns expressed both by the Secretary of State and the regulator.

While it may technically be a private company, the fact that its funding derives almost wholly from the taxpayer and its debt is backed by the Government, means payment of such high bonuses to its senior management at a time when the public sector has been asked to accept a pay freeze is to say the least unattractive.

It is patently clear that the current mechanisms for delivering accountability and efficiency are inadequate.

The Coalition Agreement carries forward the Conservative manifesto commitment to reform Network Rail so that it becomes more responsive and accountable to its direct customers the train and freight operators and to the passengers and business customers they serve.

And we are determined to see costs come down.

This issue will be at the heart of the McNulty Review of costs in the rail industry and I am grateful to those of you here who are submitting your views and suggestions to Sir Roy's work.

We're carefully considering the best options for reform at Network Rail.

And let me make it clear that the new Government will judge the issues on their merits.

We will not be driven by tortuous attempts to keep Network Rail off the nation's balance sheet.

While it is too early today to set out exactly what changes we will make at Network Rail, I can guarantee you that there will be change.

The fourth policy area I'd like to touch on is perhaps even more difficult than the controversial questions around Network Rail, and that is the future for important freight upgrade projects around the network.

The pressing need to deal with the deficit will clearly have an impact on how far and how fast we can go in delivering the enhancements that the freight industry wants to see.

But I want to reassure you that I understand how important these projects are to your industry and to the economy as a whole, and to assure you that we will take forward this upgrade work where this can be reconcilable with our commitment to cut the deficit and the budgetary constraints this imposes.

I welcome the work done by the previous Government on the Strategic Freight Network which had much to recommend it, not least the fact that the rail freight industry was positively engaged in the process of setting priorities for the programme.

By way of example, I should single out the importance of the Peterborough to Nuneaton scheme.

I believe that it provides a genuinely sustainable answer to the increase in maritime container flows from Felixstowe.

I was pleased to see another major step towards the completion of the project was taken just a couple of weeks ago when the Transport and Works Order for the Nuneaton North Chord was signed.

And I'd also like to pay tribute to Network Rail for completing the vital gauge enhancement work to Southampton Tunnel with minimum disruption to passenger and freight services.

And in taking forward reforms to the planning system we will bear in mind the impact on delivering important rail freight projects.

Although we are committed to abolishing the Infrastructure Planning Commission, we'll replace it with an efficient and democratically accountable alternative.

We'll set up a new ""Major Infrastructure Unit"" as part of the existing Planning Inspectorate.

That way, we retain the benefits of a fast-track process for major projects, including strategic rail freight interchanges of 60 hectares or more.

You'll appreciate that great care needs to be taken on this issue.

I understand the importance of these interchanges to a successful rail freight sector and for modal switch.

However, it is absolutely vital that the locations of these interchanges are selected with great care and that careful consideration is given to the impact on the local environment and the concerns of local communities.

Moving on to my fifth theme, I believe it's important to make progress with the liberalisation of European rail freight markets.

As a former MEP, I well recall the difficult task for seeking to prise open markets to European-wide competition.

Although there is still a long way to go, I welcome progress towards a more commercial and liberalised Channel Tunnel regime.

This year for example we have seen an increase in the number of through freight trains from Italy to the Midlands which I'm told are around 24 hours faster than equivalent road deliveries.

And I welcome the progress Network Rail is making on the work needed to allow European gauge wagons from the Channel Tunnel to access the Barking and Dagenham freight terminals and provide an attractive alternative to road haulage on this strategically vital route.

Sixthly and lastly, I can confirm that super-lorries will not be authorised to travel on UK roads by the new Government.

Like our predecessors, we reject the proposal to pilot Longer Heavier vehicles exceeding 18.75 metres in length.

Quite apart from the concerns of the rail freight industry, we simply do not believe the nation's roads are designed to deal with such vehicles and are not persuaded by the arguments for their introduction.

## Conclusion

In concluding my remarks this morning, I'd like to return to the wider economic picture.

Of course, these are still early days for the new Coalition Government.

But we are under no illusions about the gravity or the urgency of the task we face.

We have to tackle the largest fiscal deficit in British peacetime history and kick-start our damaged economy.

On top of this, we have to find a way to put Britain on a trajectory towards a low carbon economy to honour our environmental commitments and avert catastrophic climate change.

Certainly, the transport sector will need to take its share of the pain in terms of tackling the deficit.

I'm afraid there is no escaping that.

But it is self-evident that transport has a crucial role to play in getting Britain out of the mess we're in by helping to generate the jobs and economic growth we need to secure the recovery and enhance our competitiveness in the globalised world economy.

And we have made clear our determination to put rail at the heart of our transport strategy and to reform the way the railways are run so they work better both for freight customers and passengers.

Now I know the job of rail minister isn't easy at the best of times, certainly not during the age of austerity

But I look forward to working with you here today and the rail freight industry as a whole, as together we seek ways to address the many difficult and demanding challenges we will face in the months and years to come.

I am sure your industry will be equal to the challenge.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20100707b,Speech to AOA Summer reception,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","It's both an honour and a great pleasure to be with you today as the new Aviation Minister.

I'd like to use this occasion to applaud the major contribution the airport industry makes both to the economy and to the lives of millions of people.

From the jobs created to the communities connected the life-changing opportunities generated by air travel play a hugely important and positive role in modern Britain and I pay tribute to all of you here and the companies you represent for the work you do make that possible.

And it's always important to expressly acknowledge the special role regional airports play in the economy.

So often at the heart of the regional economies they serve I'm sure everyone here will be well aware of the major importance of these airports and the connectivity they provide.

Let me assure you that the new Government's aviation policy will always seek to take on board the regional airport perspective in the decisions we make.

That's why we've asked the AOA to join the taskforce on airports in the south east to give a perspective from across the industry and across the country.

And I'd like to assure you that the new Government is acutely aware of the grave challenges the industry as a whole faces right now.

First you were hit by the world-wide recession which dented consumer confidence cut passenger numbers and hit jobs and profits.

Then just as the UK began tentatively emerging from the devastating downturn the Eyja-fjalla-jokull volcano blasted millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere leading to unprecedented airspace restrictions across Europe.

Add to that the ongoing and intense debate on the environmental impact of aviation both locally, in terms of noise and air quality, and globally, in terms climate change and it's clear the ingenuity, innovation and determination for which your industry is so well known will be stretched over the coming years.

I am confident that you will rise to the challenge as you always have done in the past.

And I want to assure that that creating the right conditions for a successful and sustainable future for the UK's airports and aviation industry is an important priority for this Government.

I'd like to mention just a few examples of what we're doing to bring this about.

Firstly, there's the very difficult work we are undertaking to tackle the deficit put the economy on a sound footing and relieve the burden of red tape and regulation on the business community as a whole.

There will be pain in the months and years to come as we seek to grapple with the devastating crisis in the public finances we inherited from our predecessors.

But painful as it will be it's the only way to secure the economic stability needed for your industry and others to invest and flourish in the way needed to create jobs and revive prosperity.

Secondly we need to take care to ensure that the reform of APD to which the Coalition is committed results in a new system which is both fair and workable.

We'll think to think carefully about how to achieve a reform that and delivers the goal of promoting a switch to flying greener fuller plans but does so without imposing disproportionate burdens on your industry.

I'll be working with Treasury colleagues with this aim in mind.

Having had extensive and productive discussions on this issue with your industry in Opposition I'm keen for that dialogue to continue in Government.

Thirdly, we want to support your efforts in improving the passenger experience.

That's why, in the Queen's Speech, we announced a Bill to modernise airport economic regulation.

It's also the reason that I will be chairing the newly established South East Airports Taskforce.

This Group will explore options for making the best use of existing airport infrastructure within the capacity constraints the new Government has set with its decision to rule out new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.

Fourthly it is clear that we need to keep security arrangements at our airports under constant review so that we can deliver the twin goals of maintaining high standards for passenger security and minimising the hassle security procedures cause.

There can be no doubt that measures needed to address the heightened terror threat have come at the cost of a deterioration in the passenger experience not to mention the obvious financial cost to airports and airlines.

There are no simple answers here but we will strive for progress and improvement in this area.

For a start I'd say we need a more intelligent approach with a greater focus on outcomes leaving more flexibility for operators in determining the best way to deliver those outcomes.

Fifthly and finally I would highlight the urgent work we are undertaking with the CAA with airlines and with manufacturers on volcanic ash.

We're acutely aware that the threat has not gone away.

We're also acutely aware of the gravity of the impact of the crisis on the airports and aviation industry and passengers.

So we're determined to continue to make real progress in improving the robustness of the regulatory framework and strengthening the UK's resilience in the face of any recurrence of volcanic activity.

## Conclusion

To conclude ladies and gentleman the ash cloud crisis provided a vivid and timely reminder of just how dependent we all are on flying.

Whether it's for business or leisure tourism or trade air travel is woven into the fabric of our modern way of life in our increasingly inter-connected and inter-dependent world.

So, yes, there's clearly no shortage of challenges ahead.

But I am confident that working together we have every chance of meeting those challenges improving the passenger experience and creating the right conditions for a successful and sustainable future for our airports and aviation industry.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20100709,National Rail Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Introductory remarks

Ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for inviting me here today - it's a pleasure to take part in one of the keynote events in the rail calendar.

While I was preparing this speech I did a little digging.

And I discovered that I am actually the nineteenth Transport Secretary over the last thirty years.

Each one of my predecessors brought his, or her, own style, character traits and approach to the job.

And each, like me, will have had to come to terms with the immense complexity of the railway industry - it is by far the most challenging area of the transport brief, with a language, history and culture of all of its own. And, as I am rapidly discovering, plenty of characters of its own as well.

Some of my predecessors were pretty openly rail sceptics.

Others, some of them not long gone, were frankly rail romantics.

I am not in either of those camps. But I place myself firmly in the category of people who believe in our railways and the spectacular renaissance they have undergone.

I remember when I was a teenager growing up in the sixties and seventies, I can distinctly remember two pieces of conventional wisdom - you know the sort that starts with ""everyone knows that..""

The first was that the cinema was in terminal decline due to the advent of colour TV. And the second was that the motor car and the motorways had sounded the death knell of our railways.

As so often happens, neither conventional wisdom was true. Indeed, cinema and the railways are both thriving and in notably better health than they were forty years ago.

We recognise that our railways can contribute fundamentally to two of our key objectives, economic growth and carbon reduction.

But they must also contribute to our first and overriding objective - fiscal retrenchment.

So, when I look at the railways, it's not through rose-tinted spectacles, but I hope with a fresh pair of eyes - aware of the opportunities but alert to the challenges. Not as a railway romantic, but as a railway realist.

That means I want to engage with you and work with you - with an open mind and an open door.

But it also means I will not shy away from telling you the hard truths when they need to be told.

And the first hard truth is that Britain's railway industry must now learn to operate in a radically altered public spending environment.

## The fiscal and economic challenge

The scale of the fiscal and economic challenge this government faced on coming to office was unprecedented.

Britain has just struggled out of the longest and deepest recession in its peacetime history.

We are saddled with the largest budget deficit of any economy in Europe - with the single exception of Ireland.

Borrowing one pound in every four we are spending, adding £3 billion each week to our national debt.

And according to pre-Budget forecasts carried out by our new and independent Office of Budget Responsibility, the permanent hole in the nation's finances and the structural deficit was even larger than had been previously thought.

Based on the spending plans that this Government inherited by the end of this Parliament British taxpayers would have been paying out £70bn a year just in interest on our national debt.

That is more than we spend on educating our children, policing our streets or defending our country - putting businesses, jobs, interest rates and the recovery at risk.

So dealing with the largest budget deficit in our peacetime history, and putting our public finances back on a sustainable path, is the single most pressing issue facing this Government and this country.

Immediately on coming into office we identified, and removed, £6 billion worth of public spending from this year, including £100 million from Network Rail's 2010-11 budget.

Last month's Emergency Budget set out the decisive measures that will set this country on the road to fiscal discipline and economic recovery with a four year plan to eliminate our structural deficit and get debt falling as a percentage of GDP.

The next major milestone on our journey to fiscal recovery will be the announcement of the Spending Review for the next four years.

We already know the overall envelope of spending we face - 25% cuts in the resource budgets for non ring-fenced departments on average and the implementation of the previous government's planned 40% reduction in capital spending from a 2010-11 baseline.

## Well judged capital spending

I am not going to pretend that this will be easy, or that it will not hurt. Of course it will.

But, for transport, and for the rail industry, there is some good news - and I think it's in two parts.

First - this new Government has rejected further capital spending cuts as the easy option in tackling the deficit.

As the Chancellor said in his Emergency Budget speech -

""Well-judged capital spending by government can help provide the new infrastructure our economy needs to compete in the modern world"".

It is my firm belief that, if we get transport infrastructure projects right, they are one of the best investments the taxpayer can make - delivering economic benefits many times their cost.

The second piece of good news is that the measures that we have set out will get the UK's public finances back into balance by 2015.

And, in terms of investment in railway infrastructure, that timescale is virtually the blink of an eye.

In the meantime, tough decisions will have to be taken.

The capital that we do have available must be focussed relentlessly on those projects that deliver the growth and the jobs that Britain now so desperately needs.

The Chancellor has made clear that the Government understands the case for well judged capital spending; that it will take tough decisions to reduce Government revenue expenditure, rather than going for the easy option of slashing investment.

But a responsible government can only invest in an efficient and cost effective railway. The challenge we collectively face is to show that we are on track to deliver that cost effective railway.

That's our shared reality. And, while we're on the subject of reality, let me say a word about rail fares.

There's been all sorts of speculation doing the rounds and I would like to put the record straight.

My position is simple - we have to reduce the cost of our railways to the public purse, and I firmly believe we must look to efficiency savings first. Anything less would be an abdication of our duty to the taxpayer and the passenger.

But it would also be a dereliction of our duty to future generations of rail users to take a dogmatic approach to the contribution current users make to the maintenance and modernisation of the railways.

To my mind, the current fares formula is a reasonable and sensible approach. But it cannot be set in stone when all the other variables are vulnerable to change and to challenges.

We will face some very stark choices and it would be irresponsible at this point to rule out even considering an increased contribution from the fare payer as part of the solution to protecting investment in the railways.

It is a stark fact that to secure a sustainable commitment to our railways, we need to secure the sustainability of our railways.

And to secure that sustainability, we must re-invent the way we work together in order to deliver more with less

## McNulty Review

As you will be aware, Sir Roy McNulty is carrying out for us a Review of Value for Money on the railways.

I've already received, and welcomed, a scoping study report from Sir Roy.

And that report confirms that the cost of the UK's railways is relatively high - both in historic terms and by comparison with other European railways.

I recognise that this report represents a very early stage in the work of Sir Roy and his team.

They will now develop his work, identifying the factors that drive up the cost of the UK's railways - and we really do need to understand those factors, whether they are structural or cultural, systemic or specific.

The next stage of the Review will involve a close look at options for ensuring public investment in the railways is delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible - and I have asked Sir Roy to accelerate key elements of his work so that his preliminary findings can inform the discussions that are made as part of the autumn Spending Review.

I am convinced that this landmark review can point the way towards the future sustainability of our railways.

I intend to use Sir Roy's report as the focus for my team's thinking about the future of the railway.

And, while we will wait to see what his report says, we do not start from an entirely blank sheet of paper. We do have some views in advance of its publication - although we will be open minded if Sir Roy makes the case for a different approach.

While I have this opportunity, I would urge industry stakeholders to engage with Sir Roy and his team to offer their fullest co-operation.

## Industry structure

One of the benefits of being a new boy is that you approach a business with unblinkered vision and a fresh perspective.

The first thing that has struck me about this industry, and it is very early days, is that the elaborate and expensive structures in place to create a simulated market do not necessarily produce the behaviour that the theory suggests.

It is clear to me that the structure of the railway industry should be designed to achieve the ambitions we have for our railways.

That means train companies which are responsive to passengers and an infrastructure operator that's responsive to train companies and able to deliver the best results for passengers, companies and the taxpayer.

So we will examine the current structures and incentives to see where improvements can be made.

An accountable structure is also a transparent structure.

The previous government's scope for manoeuvre was significantly restrained by the over-riding imperative it imposed on itself to keep Network Rail's debt off the balance sheet.

I will face no such artificial constraints. It is a matter of complete indifference to me - and indeed to the Treasury - how the national statisticians classify Network Rail's debt. Our decisions will be taken on the basis of what is right for the railway, not on the basis of accounting treatment.

We will work with the ORR to explore how best to make all the players in the rail market more responsive to their immediate customers, passengers and train operators as well as to the needs of taxpayers.

And being responsive also means being responsive to the economic realities of the day - from the services offered to customers, to the pay and conditions offered to employees, to the bonuses paid to directors.

In the private sector, many employees have had to forgo wage increases over the recession. Now, in the public sector, we are asking workers to accept a two year pay freeze as part of our collective efforts to tackle the debt crisis.

To be frank, I think a lot of people will be asking why this same pay discipline can't also be applied to the railways - an industry that, in effect, straddles the private and the public sectors because of its dependence on billions of pounds worth of taxpayers' money.

And, if we are going to ask people to endure personal sacrifices to get ourselves out of the hole we are in, then those at the top have a duty to act fairly and set the right example, especially on pay and bonuses.

## Franchising

Let me turn for a moment to rail franchising. And again, as a Government, we approach this area of policy conscious of the need to re-invent the way we work.

My Department has just announced a pause in the competition for franchises and a consultation exercise on the future of rail franchising policy, led by my Minister of State, Theresa Villiers.

Our starting point is that franchises need to be longer. Franchisees need to invest more, take more risk and have more ability to respond to changes in circumstances as they occur. In other words they need to behave more like market operatrors.

Believe me, this is a consultation that really matters.

It matters because it will give industry partners a chance to help shape our approach to rail franchising and investment in improvements to trains and services.

But it also matters because I hope it signals a change in the way we want to do things. It is not all about my department specifying its requirements in a vacuum.

It's about harnessing your energy and capacity for innovation to proactively propose changes that will deliver balanced benefits - for passengers and taxpayers.

## High Speed Rail

Before I conclude I want to reiterate this Government's commitment to high speed rail.

It lies at the heart of our transport policy. It drives difficult decisions which we have taken on additional runways at London's airports.

This Government's vision for high speed rail is of a network that is truly UK wide, with seamless links to Heathrow, and connections to Europe.

Such a network will have the potential to increase capacity, improve connections and encourage a modal shift from long road journeys and short haul flights -stimulating economic growth and contributing to our climate change targets.

What's more, because we plan a process of phased construction, I am confident that high speed rail can be delivered in an affordable way and that we can build a domestic supply chain to support the project over the thirty plus years of its life.

High speed rail has the power to transform the economic and social geography of our country in the 21st century - just as the coming of the original railway did in the 19th century.

It will transform the prospects of our regional cities and the powerhouse of the London economy.

It will help to close regional pay and wealth differentials as we literally shrink our country into a single travel to work area.

At the same time as we press ahead at full speed with HS2, so we are proceeding with the sale of a 30 year concession on HS1.

We need to make our national assets work harder for the country and we need to harness private enterprise to improve public services and deliver better value for money for the taxpayer.

The money generated from the HS1 sale will give a much needed boost to the public finances as we tackle the debt crisis head on. The risks facing HS1 now that construction is complete and operational reliability has been proved are commercial risks - of a type best managed by commercial companies.

The sale will benefit both domestic and international passengers as the successful private bidder responds to the incentives he will face to attract new operators, serve new routes and grow the business.

## Concluding remarks

I've spoken today about the bigger picture, the economic and fiscal backdrop against which the future of our railways must be planned. I have signalled, I hope, a distinct change of focus from the approach of my predecessor.

I have taken the risk of sharing with you some of my initial early perceptions of the industry and its structure.

I have been frank with you about the affordability of some of what has been promised in the past.

And I've set out my view as to what all of this means for the industry and the challenges we face in building a sustainable future for our railways.

I have argued that the best- in fact the only - way to respond to these challenges is to re-invent the way that we work.

There will be some big decisions to be taken in the autumn once our budgets are fixed - on IEP, HLOS rolling stock, electrification and the major London rail projects. Some tough choices will be required - I promise you I will not shrink from taking them.

But with the challenges, comes great opportunities. The history of the railway is characterised by innovation and invention, persistence and perseverance, achievement and advancement.

Those who work in, on and for this crucial 21st century industry are rightly proud of its long history. Today I'm here to tell you that you can be confident about its future.

Yes, this a time of challenge and change for our railways - no doubt about that.

And we will be relying on the skill, the innovation, the commitment and the dedication of the people and the organisations represented here today to step up to the plate and work with us to deliver a sustainable railway for the 21st century, meeting the needs of its passengers, as well as those of the taxpayer and the wider economy.

I have every confidence in your ability to deliver and I have every confidence in the future of this great industry.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-20100714,LowCVP conference,"Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","## Introduction

Thank you for inviting me to speak at this important event.

It may be helpful if I indicate that this Government has two clear priorities. Sorting out Britain's financial problems, and developing a greener, low carbon economy.  These priorities are complementary, not contradictory.

Transport has a crucial role to play in achieving these goals. Indeed, Transport Secretary Philip Hammond has said that his twin aims are to ensure that the transport sector contributes to economic growth and to the achievement of our carbon reduction targets.

In respect of the economic challenge we face, we are taking urgent and immediate action to deal with the debt crisis. It is vital we have a strong and stable economy to support the transition to a greener low carbon economy in future.

We have already announced some spending cuts - with the DfT contributing £683m this year - and now the focus is on autumn's Spending Review.

Of course this is going to require some tough and difficult decisions. We have to cut waste, prioritise the most important schemes, and deliver better value for every pound of public expenditure.

We will also reform the way that transport projects are appraised in England - so that schemes offering the best carbon efficiency and value for money are fully recognised. The revised system will be launched after the Spending Review.

Only after the Spending Review can we identify which major transport programmes we will be able to support, and provide precise details about funding for the immediate future.

But let me be clear. Cutting our spending doesn't have to be incompatible with a low carbon agenda. Some low carbon choices already offer outstanding value for money - and our future goal is a market for green vehicles that makes economic as well as environmental sense.

Green jobs and green investment are essential for our economic recovery.  This makes hard economic sense.

Let me now give you a quick overview of some of the ways in which the new Government is approaching the low carbon transport agenda.

## Vehicles

The car is key.  While rail is important, the vast majority of journeys are, and will continue to be, made by car; progress must be made on road vehicles in order to reduce carbon.  The enemy is not the car, but the carbon.

So, a key part of any strategy to reduce transport's emissions is making sure that the cars we drive are as clean and fuel-efficient as possible.

In the longer term, electric vehicles are increasingly likely to provide a clean, low carbon alternative, with air quality as well as climate change benefits.

But in the short term, the majority of CO2 savings from road transport will come from improvements to conventional technologies, driven mostly by EU regulations on fuel efficiency.   We can't just sit back and wait for electric vehicles to ride to the rescue tomorrow: we have to make sure we're squeezing more fuel efficiency out of petrol and diesel cars today.

And we mustn't forget vans either. They are vital to our low carbon vehicle programme, and we are considering this aspect. We will shortly be publishing a reply to the very informative responses received during the recent consultation on the draft van CO2 regulation.

## Electric vehicles

But what about the longer-term future?

No-one knows, of course, which technology will dominate - but there are already electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles (EVs and PHEVs) which are close to market.

I am well aware of the views of many influential stakeholders on the need for Government support to kick-start the plug-in car market.  We have listened very carefully to what the car manufactures, the Climate Change Committee, environmental groups and others have said on this, and I know that this is something that you will be discussing later today at your conference.

In the coalition agreement we said we will mandate a national recharging network as well as a smart grid and smart metering.  We are carefully considering the options for delivering value for money, and an infrastructure that's fit for purpose.

A recharging infrastructure is one thing.  Getting people to buy the cars is another.

I know that many of you are impatient to hear how we might support purchases of low-carbon vehicles, including electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

This is something which we are currently considering very carefully as we review our Departmental commitments..  We understand the need to give some clarity and certainty here, and we will be making an announcement as soon as possible.

## Buses

The low carbon transport agenda is not just about low carbon cars. I know that LowCVP has made a very useful contribution over the years to help develop a market for low carbon buses.

Over the past year, my Department has welcomed the LowCVP's support in helping to design and promote a framework of incentives for low carbon buses including the roll out of the Green Bus Fund.

And as the Minister for buses, this is an area I'm keen to support. Last week I announced £15m funding for green buses which will see over 150 new low carbon vehicles joining fleets throughout England.

In addition to the £30m for round one which we are currently paying out, this funding is intended to put low carbon buses within the reach of as many operators and local authorities as possible throughout England.

Bus operators and councils can bid for the money which they can then use towards the additional up-front cost of buying low carbon buses.

We want to support new transport technologies to help make our transport system greener and more sustainable. This investment will stimulate the market for low carbon buses by reducing some of the initial costs for operators and councils.

It will deliver significant benefits, in particular reducing the impact of road transport on climate change and improving air quality.

Low carbon buses use at least 30 per cent less fuel and emit nearly a third less carbon than a conventional bus, yet they currently make up a tiny fraction of buses on the road.

This may partly be due to uncertainty about the operational performance of low carbon buses. This funding will help to address this information gap by requiring the winning bidders to share information with others in the industry.

## Biofuels

Biofuels has been a very complex and controversial area in recent years. There is no doubt that they have an important part to play in the overall mix of measures to decarbonise transport. There has equally and rightly been much concern about the wider sustainability of biofuels: this is a debate I followed closely when I was in opposition.

It is abundantly clear to me that, while there are many good biofuels, such as used cooking oil, there are also many biofuels which deliver no environmental benefits whatsoever, particularly when indirect impacts are taken into account.

Given this, I believe that it is right that the Government should take some additional time to review this subject carefully, to ensure that policy decisions going forward are robust and stable, especially in respect of the uncertainties of the Fuel Quality Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive, and how they will work together.

I have discussed these issues with stakeholders who have impressed on me their strong views - both about the benefits and also about other wider implications of biofuels use, such as concerns over indirect land use change. I'm sure you will agree that a policy of stop-start, on-off support for biofuels is in no-one's interests: we all need a clear long-term direction - and that's what we aim to provide.

## Travel choices

Technology and cleaner fuels are important in reducing emissions, but they are not enough on their own. We also need to think about the choices we make, as individuals and businesses, about when, where and how we travel, and how we carry goods around the country.

As you know well, significant savings can be achieved simply through the type of vehicles we purchase or the way we use them. And I know LowCVP has provided a useful input into this area of work - particularly through the launch of the fuel economy labels for both new and used cars - something I welcome.

This can be a challenging area, and transport behaviours can be difficult to influence. I had a useful discussion with the Energy Saving Trust last week about some of these challenges. I was encouraged to hear that they are seeing some promising results from their work with individuals and business fleets. And of course, many of the actions in this area do make sense on both economic and environmental grounds.

## Alternatives to travel

Of course the Government has an important role to play here.  Indeed, I am the first Transport Minister to say 'don't travel'!

We currently think of transport in terms of four different modes - road, rail, air, and water.  I want us all to start recognising that 'communication' can be the 5th mode... and that communications technology can provide an alternative to travel in the first place.

So I'm looking into ideas and measures that enable people to do business without having to leave their homes or offices, for instance through the use of broadband-enabled technologies.

I was pleased to read in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday that my new remit - developing alternatives to travel - was welcomed by the CBI and the Campaign for Better Transport.

There is a common theme here - cutting carbon, creating jobs.

## Supporting business, deregulation

Again, the challenge for government and the low carbon industry is to deliver carbon savings in a way which also creates jobs and economic benefits.

We are committed to supporting the development of a world class low carbon vehicle industry in Britain. The shift to lower carbon vehicles will create a new production and business model, and provide the opportunity for a reinvigorated UK automotive sector, supporting a rebalancing of the economy towards high tech jobs.

I am very impressed with progress made by the motor industry in this country towards greener vehicles - from major manufacturers, to scores of specialist high-tech suppliers and engineering companies. The move to ultra-low carbon vehicles is creating diverse business opportunities in the automotive supply chain and associated energy storage and infrastructure sectors.

Renault/Nissan's decision to manufacture the Leaf electric car in Sunderland, as well as to locate its European battery plant at the Sunderland plant is very welcome.  One of the first decisions of the new Government was to re-confirm £20m towards this valuable project.  We also welcome Toyota's investment to build the new hybrid Auris in Burnaston.  Both are strong endorsements of the UK as a manufacturing base for the next generation of cars.

And smaller, highly innovative companies - like Allied in Scotland, Modec in Coventry, Smiths in Tyne and Wear, and Ashwoods in Exeter - are showing what is possible in respect of electric and hybrid vans.

## Deregulation

Part of our commitment to creating a business-friendly environment in the UK involves cutting costs - and reducing the regulatory burden.

The Coalition agreement makes it clear that we want to turn old thinking on its head and develop new approaches to government. We want to avoid the bureaucratic levers of the past and find intelligent ways to encourage, support and enable people to make better choices for themselves.

And we are starting to do that.

On the 1st of July, Vince Cable chaired the first Reducing Regulation Cabinet Committee. This committee, along with a new ""challenge group"", will help change the culture of Government and find new ways of solving problems, reducing the red tape that can strangle enterprise.

This will help ensure that any new regulations are robustly justified, and that all other options have been considered before regulations are introduced.

We are also introducing a ""One-In - One-Out"" regulatory management system, so that any new regulatory costs will be compensated by even greater cuts to the cost of old laws.

We need businesses to drive the growth our economy needs, not be tied up with form filling, and the Government is determined to do all it can to make that happen.

## Conclusion

Thank you for inviting me to speak at this important and timely event.

And let me take this opportunity to thank the motor industry - and the low carbon vehicle industry - for everything you have accomplished in recent years to get us to where we are today.

I sincerely believe that you are the modern day equivalent of some of the early motor industry pioneers who were responsible for revolutionising personal mobility in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

What you are doing is of historic significance - and we are determined to support you so that the transport sector can play a central role in reducing carbon emissions.

It's very early days - it's less than nine weeks since I took up my post - but I look forward to working with you to meet our shared goals.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-20100720,Local Transport Today conference,"Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you very much indeed. I confess that although I have been using the Department's Brompton and dispensing with the Ministerial car, I thought the Oval was too far to come by bike so I did come by tube. As a cricket fan I have to confess shame-facedly it is my first visit to the Oval, which led to a rather surreal experience getting off the tube and being told this station is Oval when clearly it wasn't. However I am over that. It reminds me there is quirkiness in transport and one of the joys I remember from walking down Whitehall was to see a couple of American tourists see the sign that said 'Subway' and saying ""lets get the subway"", wandering in and come out the other side finding no tube. Such is life.

Anyway enough of that, and on to more serious matters. I suppose we should start with the usual government health warning which is to talk about the deficit. If you wish to groan please do so now. We do have an enormous financial situation to deal with. Had we not taken action we would, at the end of this Parliament, be spending on interest payments alone £70 billion a year. That is simply completely untenable so we had to take quick action. The way I describe it is like if you are running a car which is dangerously low on oil and if we carry on like that the car would eventually explode. You have to stop the car, top up the oil, give it a service, and put it back on the road. That is what we are doing at the moment to try to make sure we can go forward on a sensible basis.

If I could just mention one or two facts so that you are aware of where we are going on the Spending Review. The Department for Transport committed itself to a reduction of £683 million this year; including sadly £309 million from grants to local authorities, and of course the major transport schemes the department have been suspended pending the Spending Review. But I want to make it absolutely clear that the Government's view, not just the department's view but the Government's view, is that spending on transport, particularly capital, projects is essential if we are going to move forward and help rebuild the economy. There is a very high correlation between transport spend and the positive impact it has on the economy and that is why the Secretary of State said just the other day, and I quote him ""just because our priority is to deal with the debt crisis this does not mean we neglect our central responsibility to provide Britain with transport that works effectively and efficiently and to increase transport capacity where it is most needed to meet long term increases in demand"".

So that is what we are trying to do. We are trying to make sure when we come out of this and when the smoke clears on the Spending Review, that we are in a good position to go forward with capital projects. Now the timetable for that is that the submissions have gone in from the Department, and indeed every Department, to the Treasury. They will be analysed over the summer (so if you are a Treasury official I am afraid you are not having much of a holiday this August) and the Chancellor will announce on 20 October the departmental allocations. At that stage we will be able to take a view on where we go forward with our particular budget and what we could sensibly prioritise at that point. So hopefully by the end of the year we will all be clear both on allocations for local government as a matter of fact, and also on allocations within the Department on the terms of those priorities.

In parallel with that process, what we are also doing in line with the coalition agreement is reviewing the way that transport schemes are prioritised. We are looking at the formula, the NATA (New Approach to Transport Appraisal) which determines the cost benefit ratio of schemes because our view is that the formula isn't necessarily one which produces the right result in this day and age. You will be aware of the problems with that if, for example, you have a railway scheme and you abstract traffic then that has been counted against the railway scheme on the basis that the Chancellor loses fuel duty revenue. That clearly is a nonsensical consequence. So those sorts of idiocies are being removed from the formula. So that is going on in parallel so we hope to be able to apply a better formula at the time when we know how much money we have got in order to be able to prioritise sensibly at that stage.

Now the two overriding challenges that we face, or targets we set ourselves, for government as a whole. One is to rebuild the economy, as I have just been referring to. Without job creation from the private sector in particular, we aren't going to be able to deliver the sort of things in the public sector we want to deliver. So that is obviously key. The second issue is to reduce carbon emissions, recognising the challenge of climate change and the enormous difficulties in the transport sector. In particular because although business, for example, has been reducing its carbon emissions, those in the transport sector have been increasing and we have to get a hold on that and that leads us to I think looking on how we deliver transport.

Now obviously in the longer term we want to look at cleaning up vehicles. The Secretary of State in particular is very keen on seeing what we can do to move towards cleaner and possibly electric vehicles. But we could also make our transport systems cleaner and I am conscious that a very large proportion of journeys are actually of 5 miles and under or indeed 2 miles or under which may be very relevant, I would suggest, to this particular audience. So I will come back to that in a moment.

But I also want to talk now about the other strand which you will see running through Government policy in all shapes and forms and all departments which is the ideal localism. Now governments have always talked about localism in my experience. They don't do much about it but I remember, thank you for your introduction, not just being a County Councillor and actually Vice Chair of the Highways Committee I should mention, but also Leader of my District Council and indeed the Parish Council for 16 years. In fact I added it up the other day and I have been in Public Office for 49 years if you multiply these things together. So I am very committed to local government and I used to find it deeply frustrating to get done what we wanted to do and we thought that we knew best which I think we did do! I think to find that there was some regulation somewhere, some restrictions and some requirement to fill in a form. There was some Ministerial approval required and I found that deeply restrictive. We are going to get rid of all that. The ring fencing of money is going to be going. The extension of power down to local councils is coming. The Review for local finance is on its way and those of you in local government are going to see a transformation in terms of what you have to deal with and the ability you will have to shape your own areas in a way you should have been able to do so for many many years, but you will be able to do so in the future.

Now let me announce something today on local transport plans. We think development of local transport plans is crucial and of course you will be aware you have a statutory duty to produce your LTPs by next April 2011. We happen to think that local transport plans remain the best way for authorities to plan transport strategy and delivery and will ensure from our point of view that funding allocations are available in good time for completion of those plans by next April. We also think local transport plans are the best way to make sure that funding is spent efficiently and effectively and enables you to focus on the priorities not just the economy and carbon reductions referred to but also road safety are affordability and accessibility people's health and well being for example. But I have just been talking about localism so here is what we are going to do about this. In line with this commitment to localism my Department no longer seeking to intervene in the way local authorities review their progress against local transport plans. As far as we are concerned, it is entirely a matter for you. We will no longer require reports or reviews for Central Government in terms of what you are doing. You will have to get a 2011 plan there but after that running a plan that is in place which is your legal requirement is up to you what you do about that. We think they are a good tool and we think you will want to use them but we will no be restrictive in terms of how you use them. We want to help you prioritise transport schemes that offer the best outcomes to tax payers, business growth, passengers and the environment.

Now as you probably know we are also scrapping the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and are inviting local groups to form local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) to help boost development and strengthen local economy. LEPs are now taking ship shape across the country to manage responsibilities including transport and infrastructure. The requirements for the next few years will make it important for authorities to work together to identify where there is scope for efficiencies and savings and although this is going to be a very tough time for us all whether in Central or Local Government in terms of finances I hope that we will all nationally and locally look to see whether we can generally make savings, for example, by common procurement, rather than by cutting something at the front end like an important bus service which is easier and obvious you can do that very quickly. We have got to be creative, all of us, in terms of how we use the money which is there.

Now transport is no respecter of local authority boundaries which you will appreciate which is why under this Government there will be lots of opportunities for a neighbouring authority to plan and prioritise transport schemes over wider economic regions so I hope all areas across England will consider the potential offer by LEPs to improve the quality and value to local transport services. My department will be keen to engage with effective partnerships wherever there are strategic issues to be considered.

Let me just say something now very quickly on buses and I do so because I am conscious that buses are the predominant form of public transport. Railways get a lot of coverage and they are very important. They are always in the newspapers, buses less so. Actually buses are the predominant form of transport. They are also the form of transport used by those with lower incomes. So it is important for social, economic and environmental reasons that we get this right and our vision is quite clearly is to get more people on buses, that is what we want to do. But we also want to get a fairer deal for the tax payer and a fairer deal for the fare payer and I am frankly not convinced that it is happening at the present time.  £2.5 billion of public money is spent on buses each year so it is only like every other area of public spending which is questioned whether the bus market is delivering the best service for passengers and the best value for the tax payer. That's fine, I welcome the current Competition Commission Inquiry into the local bus market. The Commission is best placed to deal with the difficult questions about the level of competition between bus operators and whether the current regulatory framework for buses is the right one. My Department has submitted evidence to the Competition Commission, and is engaging fully in the process as it continues before the conclusions are announced later on this year in draft form and next year in final form. They are an independent body and they will reach their own conclusions, but I think it is important that we put the perspective of the Department and that is what we have done.

I am also keen to see the faster roll-out of smart ticketing across England, because that offers huge potential benefits for passengers, local authorities and operators. The Government has made £10 million of funding available to 9 big cities outside London and subsequently to the outcome of the Spending Review. I am very keen to incentivise operators and local authorities to do more. I am very struck by an example from Eurostar who, simply by offering a through ticket from stations like York and Peterborough to Brussels and Paris, doing nothing else, have actually increased the market for people using the train between those two destinations simply because they have only got one ticket - they have changed their behaviour. We underestimate potentially the value of getting ticketing right in terms of securing modal shift.

I also recently announced another £15 million of government funding for a fleet of low carbon buses which we estimate will save 50,000 tonnes of CO2 over a 15 year period. More importantly, I hope it will drive the market for such buses so they become the norm across our country.

As far as trams are concerned I am very keen to follow the lead of cities like Manchester and Nottingham showing the value of light rail and how it can contribute. Too many tram schemes have been started and failed and the last 10 years have not been a happy time for light rail. That's why I have initiated in the Department a full review of the costs of light rail to understand why those schemes have failed, to look at comparisons elsewhere in Europe, to examine the cost base, for example in terms of utilities, and to try to get light rail in a position where it can compete sensibly for funding when the Spending Review is over.

On roads, obviously improved public transport is essential if we are to tackle the scourge of congestion. But there are other ways we can help the traffic flow in our towns and cities. We want authorities to be free to make their own decisions on how best to manage their street works and in particular to consider permit schemes like those that have been launched in Kent and London and which are clearly already delivering impressive results. Complaints about road works in Kent have fallen by half since the scheme's introduction in January. We will also be looking at a pilot Lane Rental scheme.

The traffic signs policy review is also a priority for the Department and is progressing well. We expect that to be completed by early next year. You will also be aware, although it is a Home Office matter, that we are looking seriously at the problem of clamping on private land which is something everybody seems to feel strongly about and a large number of people appear to have suffered from up and down the country - one and two of our Ministerial colleagues feel very strongly about the matter.

We are also committed to working a more closely with councils, road safety groups, police, transport operators and others to reduce accidents on local roads.

Now one last area I wanted to refer to is the issue of alternatives to travel. This is a new part of the transport Department so I am the first Minister to encourage people not to travel. So it is counter intuitive perhaps, but nevertheless it has its value. Why? Because although there is a role for making sure our transport systems are green, and we have to do that, there is also a role in economic and environmental terms from looking at whether we have to go from A to B at all. If we are going to encourage home working even if 1 in 10 days are spent at home, think of the difference they would make in terms of congestion on the roads for those who are left on the roads. If we can get people video conferencing for when they are talking to businesses in America, or wherever it happens, think of the carbon that can be saved and the time that can be saved for business by not having to fly from Heathrow across the pond. So there are economical and environmental benefits to be pursued from this and that is why I was very pleased when I read the issue in the Daily Telegraph the other day. It was Matthew Farrow from the CBI who said ""We agree there needs to be big changes to the way we work and commute... employers are increasingly enabling staff to stagger their commutes and break out of the usual 'nine to five'."" It was also welcome by the Campaign for Better Transport who described it as a ""huge step forward"". So there we are it's a policy that pleases many it seems so obviously that is something that Government wants to take forward. It is a bold policy, there's no doubt about that, but if I can say here in the Oval it is better to be 'bowled' than to be 'stumped' when it comes to policy!

So Mr Chairman let me just say I hope today I have given you an insight in to how the Government's local transport strategy will help us cut spending, promote localism, improve connectivity, encourage economic recovery and protect the environment. Now the big story in the next couple of years will be coming to terms with the financial problem the country has. But that needn't be a cloud which stops us moving forward and doing the right thing in transport. There will be thousands of smaller stories - councils, communities doing things in new ways, and by pushing the localism agenda we are going to free-up innovation for councils, just to try things out and lead by example so that people can pick up these good ideas and say 'they are doing this down the road why don't we try it'. We want to change the way people travel, to connect the different travel modes more effectively, to reward greener travel initiatives, to link transport policy to local health issues. Cycling, for example, has got a very good cost/ratio in terms of transport, but is also very good in terms of tackling obesity so has a knock on effect that is very useful for society. These are areas that can make real progress in our local agenda. I very much look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead.

Thank you.

","Hello.

I'm really sorry I can't be with you in person today. None-the less, this is an important event dealing with important issues and I really did want to find a way to take part in it.

So thank-you for giving me an opportunity to say a few words through the wonders of modern communications technology and, indeed, for helping me to promote another part of my brief - namely alternatives to travel.

My Department is focused on building a modern and sustainable transport system - one that connects our communities, supports our economy and protects our environment. But, as you'll understand, that is a real challenge when set against the backdrop of the country's enormous inherited debt crisis.

On the spending plans we inherited, British taxpayers would be paying out £70 billion in debt interest a year by the end of this Parliament - that's more than we spend on educating our children, defending our country or policing our streets. To use a motoring metaphor, the public finances inherited by the Coalition Government resembled a car that had been running dangerously low on engine oil. We have had to stop the car, top it up, give it a service and get it back on the road in a fit state to take us forward.

So the Government's top priority is to tackle that legacy of debt. And a watershed moment in our efforts to put the public finances back on track will be the autumn Spending Review. But the challenge of the Spending Review is also an opportunity - an opportunity to reassess and re-evaluate priorities in transport spending.

Local highways will, of course, be no exception to this process. But make no mistake - our local highways matter. They are not simply a vital part of the wider transport network, they are the most valuable transport assets that a local authority will own. Unfortunately, they can also be an easy target for cuts. Well, given that local roads help to support the social and economic goals, both of central Government and local authorities, unthinking cuts all too often are a false economy.

Let me give you some good news. This Government is committed to localism, to letting councils get on with they job for which they were elected. Under this Government, local authorities like yours will have greater freedom to spend money where it is needed. In other words, you will be able to focus and target capital investment on those areas that offer the very best returns. And the indications are that investment in highways maintenance not only offers real value for money for taxpayers, it also produces benefits for the travelling public in lower vehicle operating costs and faster travel times.

I'm sure that everyone in the audience will know that, in March this year, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy published a new code of practice on transport infrastructure assets. This will begin to affect local authorities in a very real way from 2012/13, when the current replacement cost of their highways assets begins to appear in their accounts. And, while, at first glance, the change may seem to be a challenging one, it also offers genuine benefits to local authorities because the evidence base for the budget decisions you take, and the consequences of those decisions, will be much clearer to you, your Council Tax payers and the wider public. All in all, better decision making.

The new code will mean that if local authorities fail to invest in their highways networks the impact on asset values will be plain for all to see. There is a mandatory dry run in 2011/12 So, while I have the chance, I want to tell you that it's not too late to register for the launch event that CIPFA are running on 19th July in London at the Treasury.

Asset management is an important tool for delivering efficiencies. Indeed, CIPFA themselves estimate that somewhere in the order of 5% a year worth of savings can be achieved. So, in an age where all of us must learn to do more with less, making the best use of existing assets is often a better choice than spending on new build. Put simply, keeping up investment in highways maintenance, even in testing times, makes economic sense, not just transport sense. That's the reason that I, and the Secretary of State, were united in ruling out any cuts in the money for repairing pot holes - a stitch in time and all that.

Local roads are so much more than highways that take you from A to B. They are also where people live, work and shop. So when we plan, when we devise policy and when we debate and discuss the key issues we should consider each and every stakeholder - from car drivers to pedestrians, and from local residents to local businesses.

We should also think about the contribution local highways make towards sustainable travel. After all, making a journey by bike or on foot - two forms of travel that are good for our health as well as good for the environment - would be a lot more difficult without properly maintained roads and pavements. And the same is equally true when people come to use public transport like buses, or join car clubs. Both modes of travel help to cut carbon emissions but both depend on decent roads.

Our approach to local roads is rooted in this Government's commitment to localism. For us, the new politics we have promised is one where the best form of government is the government that lets people govern themselves.

That's why, in the Coalition Agreement, we have pledged to a review of local government finance - something that will give greater financial autonomy to local government.

It's also why, in the Queen's Speech, we announced the Devolution and Localism Bill. This important Bill will shift power from the central state back into the hands of individuals, communities and councils. It will empower local people giving them more power over local government. And it will free local government from central and regional control so that they can ensure services are delivered according to local needs.

It doesn't make sense for local councils to have to fill in endless forms, to bid for this or that pot of money, or to seek clearance from central government for actions that you are well capable of deciding for yourselves. We are going to deal with that.

Okay - I know you have a packed schedule. So it just remains to me to thank you for listening and to wish you an enjoyable and productive day. I look forward to working with you all in the months and years to come.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20100910,Sustainable transport,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","I congratulate His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, START and IBM for arranging this landmark summit, and in particular for dedicating this third day to the vitally important debate on sustainable transport.

It's a debate that involves every level of government, from town hall to Whitehall.

And one that affects every community, town and city across the country.

A debate that concerns every business and employer and must engage everyone who has an interest in building a strong and competitive UK economy.

And make no mistake - the Coalition Government is committed to the sustainability agenda in everything it does, including transport.  And of course, addressing the urgent and unavoidable challenges of climate change are a key part of ensuring sustainability. But, as inheritors of a deeply unsustainable fiscal and economic position, we are all too conscious of the fact that sustainability means so much more than simply ""carbon reducing"".

Sustainable solutions have, of course, first and foremost to be environmentally sustainable. But they must also be fiscally and economically sustainable - affordable to the taxpayer in the long-term and compatible with an economic growth agenda.

And they must be socially sustainable as well - promoting social mobility and recognising the aspirations of the least-advantaged in our society and of the billions of people trying to improve their quality of life in the less-developed nations of the world.

Cutting carbon - as important as it is - is relatively simple. Doing it in a way which supports economic growth, is fiscally sustainable and promotes social mobility and sustainable development is a far tougher challenge. Indeed, one worthy of the deliberations of this distinguished gathering!

It is a little under four months since I became Secretary of State for Transport.

It wasn't the brief I had expected, or prepared for in Opposition. It is not an area in which I had any special experience or expertise.

So I faced the disadvantage of a steep learning curve, offset by the huge advantage of no baggage. No preconceptions.

Over the summer, as I have got to grips with my new Department and this fascinating sector, and met hundreds of people, throughout the industry, whose job it is to keep Britain mobile, I have become increasingly convinced of the critical role that sustainable transport must play in helping to deliver this Coalition Government's core agenda: restoring fiscal responsibility; securing sustainable economic growth; achieving carbon reduction goals and establishing social justice.

And the challenges we face in delivering that agenda are very significant. Over the last few years, Britain has suffered a near-catastrophic breakdown in sustainability.

We have become addicted to unsustainable levels of public borrowing and spending; unsustainable levels of household debt; and an unsustainable failure to integrate economic development with environmental policy.

That is why the Coalition Government's clear priorities are tackling the debt crisis and restoring sustainability to the public finances: rebuilding and re-energising our economy onto a path of sustainable growth, and delivering our long-term commitments on climate change in a way that is socially, economically and fiscally sustainable.

And the Department for Transport can and must be at the heart of this programme.

  * Contributing to fiscal consolidation through the effective prioritisation of public spending in the Transport sector and the vigorous pursuit of efficiency.
  * Supporting growth by improving the links that move goods and people around our economy.
  * Tackling climate change through policies which deliver technology and behaviour that will decarbonise mobility as we progress through the 21st century.
  * And perhaps most important of all, embedding these changes by moving away from the top-down command and control system that has characterised Government in Britain since the Second World War and distributing power back to individuals, families, communities and local government - devising solutions to our many challenges from the bottom-up, rather than from the top-down.

Having spent the summer thinking about these things, I approach these challenges with a positive outlook: I reject the proposition that we somehow face some kind of stark choice in transport between supporting economic growth and supporting environmental objectives. There is no either/or choice between generating growth and protecting the environment. Because neither growth which undermines our environmental agenda, nor environmental measures that stifle economic growth, will be sustainable in the medium term.

And the technologies are already emerging from the laboratory and onto the factory floor that will help resolve the apparent dilemma.  By embracing them - renewable energy, electric vehicle technology, sustainable biofuels - we can not only make progress towards our carbon reduction targets, but can also build the basis of a more diversified and sustainable industry, based on these new technologies of the post-carbon era.

That doesn't mean that technology alone will deliver sustainability: behaviour change will also be necessary - in the short-term because technological change alone will not get us where we need to be fast enough on the urgent agenda of greenhouse gas reduction, but in the longer-term because other elements of a sustainable transport solution - in particular, dealing with congestion - cannot be solved by technological advance alone.

So my Team at the DfT is clear, our task in the months ahead is to develop a set of transport policies that will contribute to a genuinely sustainable society: promoting green growth within a framework of local devolution, fiscal stability and social mobility.

We have already made a start.

One of our first actions on coming into office was to cancel the third runway at Heathrow and to make it clear that this Government will not support planning applications for further runways at Stansted or Gatwick.

That is not because we are ""anti-aviation"". Far from it. But it is because we recognise, firstly, that the local environmental impacts of ever-increasing usage of the South East's key airports outweigh the potential benefits, and secondly, that until technology delivers very significant reductions in aviation CO2 emissions, capacity expansion is simply incompatible with our goals on climate change.

Instead, we will focus scarce airport capacity on maintaining Heathrow's vital role as a global hub airport.

And by committing ourselves to a High-Speed Rail network - linking the major English conurbations by dedicated High-Speed Rail lines with onward links to Scotland and Wales - we can offer a real alternative to domestic air travel so that, just as flying between Paris and Brussels has all but ceased, rail will become the preferred mode of travel for the overwhelming majority of passengers between London and its hub airport and Britain's great provincial cities.

We will announce very soon detailed plans for the High-Speed Rail programme, which will be put forward for public consultation in the New Year. The first phase will run from London to Birmingham, but we will also set out a clear timetable for the extension of the network to Manchester and Leeds, with onward connections to the North East and Scotland.

And, mindful of the principles of sustainability, our aim will be to balance the benefits of High-Speed Rail to the wider community with the local environmental impacts of the line. Through careful mitigation measures, I am convinced that the most intrusive local impacts can be eliminated and a solution found which is balanced and fair.

So we see High-Speed Rail forming the backbone of one of our key transport networks for the 21st century. And the wider rail network can also play a key role in delivering reduced carbon footprint and greater mobility - but only if we can make it affordable. We have one of the most expensive railways in the world. More expensive to build, more expensive to operate and more expensive to ride on than any comparable system. That is not acceptable.  The taxpayer is contributing almost as much as the farepayer - and the farepayer is paying a lot more than his international comparators.

So a sustainable railway isn't just one which is safe, which is reliable and which is electrified to reduce its carbon footprint. It must also be one which offers value to its passengers and is deliverable with levels of taxpayer subsidy which are affordable in the long-run.

So another key task of my Department will be to review and reform the way the rail industry functions. Building on the work of Sir Roy McNulty's value-for-money study, to drive efficiency in rail investment and operations so that the railway can play its crucial part in delivering sustainable transport for the future.

But while railways have enjoyed a massive increase in passenger usage and a surge in passenger satisfaction with them, we cannot ignore the fact that 84 percent of all journeys in the UK are made by car. The roads represent our most important network and the overwhelming bulk of our total network assets. For long-distance, inter-urban journeys, our challenge is to make the train the mode of choice. For short-distance urban travel, our challenge is to make public transport or low-impact modes such as walking and cycling the most attractive options. But for intermediate journeys involving complex routing across rural and suburban areas, there is no realistic prospect of displacing the private car through persuasion rather than coercion.

And I do not favour coercion as a solution.

Whether we like it or not, the ability to travel point-to-point on an individually-tailored timetable is one of the great quality-of-life gains of the second half of the 20th century - and not one that people will give up without a fight.

And the good news is, they won't have to.

After years when the carbon reduction agenda has placed the motorist firmly on the naughty step, we are on the brink of a technological revolution that really will transform the way we see motoring in the 21st century. It won't solve the problem of urban congestion - which can only be tackled through behaviour change. And it will not, in most cases, make motoring the sensible choice for long-distance inter-urban journeys against High-Speed Rail. But it will allow the benefits that the private car delivers in rural and suburban areas and for medium-distance complex journeys to be enjoyed by future generations, without destroying the planet in the process.

Order books for the first new generation, all-electric vehicle - the Nissan Leaf - opened in the UK this month and the first vehicles will be on our roads early next year. Imported from Japan. But with Government support, by 2012 they will be rolling off production lines in Sunderland. And others will follow.

The Government's commitment, even in the face of severe public spending restraint, to direct consumer subsidies to kick-start the market for low-carbon vehicles has ensured that Britain is the principle European launch market for global manufacturers. Our Plugged-In Places programme - rolling out public charging infrastructure in London, Milton Keynes and Newcastle - will allow us to gather important information about the way people use electric cars.

Our commitment to mandate a public charging infrastructure across the country will ensure the UK remains in the vanguard of the electric vehicle revolution.

And the plug-in hybrid vehicles being developed both in Britain and abroad, promise a practical solution that will be completely carbon-free for the short trips which make up the overwhelming majority of car journeys, while offering the possibility of greater range when longer journeys are necessary.

The de-carbonisation of motoring, ironically, presents policymakers with some more complex decisions. For the last few years, it's been easy: rail good; roads bad: the carbon impact of motoring dramatically reduced the measured benefits of road network investment.

But the investments we will make over the coming years from an extremely limited pot of public capital will need to last us not just for a Parliament or two but for generations to come. And alongside our plans for a High-Speed Rail network, we must look carefully at where investment in our road infrastructure will make sense in a future of decarbonised surface transport.

And since resilience is an integral part of sustainability, it seems to me to be desirable to have at least two alternative practical modes of transport between any two population centres. Just in case Bob Crow has a son.

The road to decarbonisation will not, of course, always be smooth. The story of biofuel perhaps illustrates that truth better than any.  Once the great hope for transport decarbonisation, the biofuel story has led to early disappointments. And emphasised in spades that sustainability is about the total impact of an activity, not merely the first order effects.

But, depending on the volumes of biofuels that can be produced on a sustainable basis, they should indeed provide technical solutions to the mitigation of aviation emissions. And perhaps be able to contribute to decarbonising that element of heavy freight which cannot be moved from roads to rail - the final miles of delivery from depot to high street.

So much for our National Networks. But most journeys, of course, are made not on those national networks, but on our local roads and it is at local level that most can be done to change patterns of behaviour and to create more genuinely sustainable transport modes while stimulating urban regeneration, economic growth and social integration at the same time:

Light rail and tram schemes that link outlying and isolated estates with wealth-creating city centres.

Cycling initiatives that transform peoples' way of travelling around urban centres.

Attractive, air-conditioned buses running on prioritised routes that have the kind of appeal to passengers that metro systems have traditionally enjoyed.

Smart cards to make multi-modal journeys easy and seamless.

All of these types of scheme, when carefully thought-out and properly implemented, demonstrate extraordinarily high value-for-money.  But they all have something else in common: they are essentially local.

That means they cannot be mandated from Whitehall. They have to be devised, developed, owned, promoted and implemented locally.

That is why, as a key part of our local transport agenda, we want to devolve as much responsibility  for local transport initiatives as possible to local level. By the end of this Parliament,  I want to see far fewer civil servants sitting in my Department evaluating, monitoring and appraising transport schemes proposed by local authorities in Bradford, Birmingham or Bristol.

The Government is inviting proposals from local authorities to form Local Enterprise Partnerships. My Department will seek to work with them, either individually or in strategic consortia, delegating decision making to them to allow them to develop truly innovative transport solutions.

Sustainable local transport will depend on solutions invented in the place it serves. Solutions tailored for the specific needs and behaviour patterns of individual communities.

Addressing congestion, urban regeneration, social integration, road safety, air quality and local environmental and carbon reduction targets as part of a single integrated agenda.

Delivering solutions - not ticking boxes on a Government form.

What local communities need is answers to problems, not poorly-designed, 18-inch wide cycle lanes, laid down roads that go nowhere simply to meet some target in a plan handed down from Whitehall.

So - national network solutions, technological change and local problem solving.

But you might be surprised to know that the most innovative change we have made in the Department for Transport in the last four months is to introduce a portfolio responsibility for ""non-travel"".

Promoting alternatives to travel is a key part of the sustainability agenda. And although it has not traditionally been thought of as a transport responsibility, I have decided that we should integrate it into our transport agenda. So my colleague, Norman Baker, is working with colleagues at DCMS, in BIS and in other Departments to look at reducing the demand for travel, particularly for business.

Encouraging home working; promoting the use of high-speed broadband for both business and leisure purposes and encouraging the uptake of video conferencing as an alternative to long-distance travel.

No, it is not the mission of the Department for Transport to stop people travelling, but unnecessary travel is expensive in environmental and financial terms and, if we can help businesses to understand the opportunities to operate efficiently with a need for less travel, we will be advancing both their agendas and our own.

## Conclusion

We face huge challenges in refocusing Britain's economy to a sustainable future.

Years ago, long before Ireland's motorways were built, I was driving across that country with a colleague to a meeting on the west coast.

We stopped in a small town in the Irish Midlands to ask directions of an elderly farmer.

""How would you get to Sligo"" I asked.

""Well, you wouldn't start from here"", was his instant reply.

That is sometimes how I feel about the challenges the Coalition faces. But ""here"" is where we have to start from.

And in Transport, we are clear that we have a vital part to play in addressing the challenges of the fiscal deficit, declining economic competitiveness, climate change and social exclusion.

Those challenges call for a genuinely sustainable policy response: A response that recognises the need for carbon reduction, fiscal discipline, economic growth, social justice and genuine localism.

Not one, or some of them,  But all of them. Together. In every policy initiative.

In four months we have made a start.

But we are under no illusion about the scale of the challenge ahead. But if we want Britain to have a sustainable, prosperous future, there is not a moment to lose.

The time has come to face up to our problems. To get our heads out of the sand. To recognise, and learn from, our past failures. And to get on with the job of building a sustainable future for Britain without further delay.

And that is precisely what this Government intends to do.

Thank You.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20100916,Speech at Cenex Low Carbon Vehicles event,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Introductory remarks

It's a great pleasure to be here this morning and I'd like to thank the organisers - Cenex, the TSB (Technology Strategy Board), UKTI (UK trade & Investment) and the SMMT (Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders) - for putting this event together

I know this is now the third year, and although it's my first time here, I've been hearing how things that were concepts in the first year became prototypes and design models in the second year and are now out there on the tarmac as real driveable vehicles in the third year.

This is a fantastically ambitious trajectory and from what I've seen already this morning I am hugely reassured about the capacity of human ingenuity to meet the very real challenge that we face to decarbonise motoring. Presented with that challenge, industry and academia are coming together to develop solutions; and develop them rapidly.

I know there are some incredibly impressive examples being showcased here of a new breed of ultra low carbon vehicles -I'm looking forward to seeing them for myself and perhaps driving one later on this morning.

## Lazy rut

I think over the last few years we've slipped rather too easily into a lazy rut that says of 'cows have four legs, therefore all creatures with four legs are cows'. For motoring this equates to 'carbon is bad, we need to decarbonise, cars produce carbon therefore cars are bad'.

The truth is that the car has been one of the great enhancers of quality of life over the last few decades. Personal mobility, the ability to travel point-to-point on an individually-tailored timetable has been a huge boon and people are not going to give up the liberty provided by the car lightly.

Fortunately, thanks to the technological revolution we are about to embark on, they won't have to.

Yes we must tackle congestion on our roads and in our cities. And so we want to ensure that people can use alternatives for vehicle journeys such as high speed rail and public transport.

But we need to recognise that, for many journeys, the car will remain the only practical and convenient choice. Which means we must make the car sustainable by decarbonising transport over the coming years.

## Virtuous circle

So we want to encourage motorists to embrace cleaner and greener vehicles. That means creating a virtuous circle -one where, by encouraging demand, we will stimulate investment in mass production which, in turn, will bring down costs and further boost demand.

And this Government is taking a number of steps to help establish that virtuous circle -let me highlight three of them.

## Technology Strategy Board Winners

The first is the way we are working with key partners to deliver a strategic vision for automotive R&D -e.g. the Technology Strategy Board's Low Carbon Vehicles Innovation Platform.

And I'm pleased to be able to announce today that a further £24 million is being awarded to six winning consortia of the TSB competition.

The six winning projects have produced innovative solutions to the Low Carbon challenge. For example -there are hybrid technologies, composite materials, and engines redesigned to generate lower emissions and recover waste heat energy.

And the vehicles cover everything from urban utility vehicles, to extended range electric cars, to lightweight hybrid refuse collection vehicles.

This is an investment in projects that will deliver measurable economic benefits, as well as tangible environmental ones.

## Plug-In Car Grant

The second area I want to highlight is our Plug-In Car Grant -from January next year buyers will receive a grant of 25% of the price of a green car, up to £5,000.

Today I can announce the publication of the criteria that cars will have to meet in order to qualify for the Plug-In Car Grant.

Our objective has always been 'real' grants for 'real' cars - cars that are safe and reliable; cars that meet the needs of real motorists and provide a motoring experience that's as good as, if not better than, the conventionally powered vehicles they currently drive.

Now that we have published the criteria, I hope manufacturers will submit their applications for the cars they want to be accepted on to the grant scheme.

## Plugged-In Places

The third strand of our approach focuses on infrastructure -and the importance of infrastructure to support consumer acceptance of electric vehicles is absolutely clear, hence the inclusion in the Coalition Agreement of a commitment to mandate a national recharging network.

Parts of London, Milton Keynes and the North East are already in the process of installing recharging infrastructure.

We plan to hold a second round of bidding for the Plugged -In Places Programme in the autumn and I have today released guidance to the 15 places which have expressed an interest in bidding for funding - setting out in more detail what we want from these projects to support our decision-making on a national recharging network, so that they can begin the process of bid preparation.

We will announce the funding available for the second round of Plugged-In Places following the October Spending Review..

## Concluding Remarks

I believe we are on the brink of a critical transformation of road transport.

The next 30 years will see a shift from high carbon to low carbon based road travel, as significant as the shift a century ago from the horse to the combustion engine. This, now regular, event is the embodiment of that process.

Once that shift is underway, and clearly irreversible, policy makers will be able to plan for a future that includes the car -safe in the knowledge the benefits of individual travel will be available to future generations without compromising our carbon reduction goals.

That is a significant strategic prize and this Government will continue to support the industry in attaining it.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-20100929,Real Time Information group,"Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","It's a great pleasure to be here today, so thank you for inviting me along. I'm delighted to have this chance to make a small contribution to a big event.

Groucho Marx once joked - ""why should I care about the future, what's it ever done for me?""

Well, caring about the future is something we should all do. And that's because we're the ones whose actions and decisions help to shape it. What we say and do in the here and now can often have an impact that lasts long beyond our own lifespan - and nowhere is that more true than in transport.

So, in the brief time I have today, I'd like to look forward - to talk about the better future for transport that we all want to see and that, together, I hope we can help create.

## Sound Finances and a Strong Economy

The first thing we have to do is recognise that we can't build a better future on the quick-sands of debt. And that's precisely why the Coalition Government has had to put tackling the inherited debt crisis front and centre of our priorities.

What does this mean for transport's future? You will understand that I cannot reveal the contents of the forthcoming Spending Review. There are clearly going to be difficult decisions, but I hope you will have taken comfort from the fact that some key transport projects have already been given the green light by the Government, including High Speed 2 and Crossrail. This shows that this Government recognises the value of investment in our transport infrastructure.

## Cleaner and Greener

We are not taking our eyes off the long-term.

The future must also be cleaner and greener -and that means providing genuine and viable low carbon travel alternatives.

The Government is setting the pace in public transport by investing an additional £15 million in low carbon buses.

As well as helping to ease congestion on our roads, low carbon buses emit nearly a third less carbon than their conventional counterparts. That's a transport win-win as far as I'm concerned.

We have also signalled our support for ultra-low carbon cars. Already, we have awarded £24 million to further develop the UK's low carbon vehicle capability, which the Government believes will place the UK at the forefront of low carbon automotive development. Our Plug in Car Grant - up to £5000 - will help motorists and businesses purchase electric, plug-in hybrid or hydrogen cars. While our Plugged in Places programme reflects the Coalition Agreement pledge to mandate a national recharging network.

A cleaner and greener tomorrow will be one where cycling and walking is increasingly the norm in our cities and towns. But it will also be one where people have a real choice when it comes to travelling less - from home working, to video conferencing to a range of innovative ways to use the internet for business and leisure. These alternatives to travel encourages business to do things in a different way, which can save money and help the environment as well.

## Joined up travel

Today's passengers demand and deserve a public transport system that is properly joined up in a way that reflects the demands of their daily lives.

So, whether you call it the ""door to door journey"", ""end-to-end travel"" or the ""whole-journey experience"", it is absolutely vital to build a future where we improve the journey from front door to final destination by enhancing the connections between, and across, the different parts of our public transport system.

Innovations such as real time information displays and improved directional signage can make a positive difference. As can simple measures like placing bus stops as close as possible to the main rail station entrance, or making sure that public announcements are clear and give the right amount of detail.

But I believe that one of the most important steps towards a more joined up transport network is smart and integrated ticketing.

The Government is very keen to see this new technology rolled out more widely and more quickly across England and so we have provided £20 million of grant funding to the nine biggest English urban areas outside London to support this. My Department has also offered a BSOG incentive of 8% for operators with operational ITSO smart systems on their buses.

In addition, my Department has required that ITSO smart ticketing infrastructure be rolled out across the five rail franchises that have been tendered since 2007, and we intend to continue to introduce conditions to this effect in the remaining franchises as they are renewed.  We have also made it a statutory requirement that all concessionary travel passes in England are ITSO-compatible smartcards. Over 10m of these have been issued to date.

Additionally, we are continuing our support of ITSO Ltd as the organisation that can help facilitate the additional roll out of schemes - and I can tell you that we are working with Transport for London and their partners to achieve ITSO compatibility across the London estate.

I'm also pleased to say that, not only are major bus operators rolling out ITSO smart ticketing across their fleet, but that smart ticketing is also being implemented by a number of key train operators - and that has to be good for integration and, as a result, good for passengers.

The billing for this conference is ""Travel 2020"".  So let me tell you my personal 2020 vision for smart cards.

By 2020 I'd like to see seamless travel on one ticket throughout the country.

  * A single smartcard ticket that you can use whether you are in Bristol on the bus, on the Tube in London or on the Metro in Newcastle.
  * A single smartcard that lets you hire a bike or join a car club.
  * A single smartcard that can be topped up in shops, online or by phone.
  * A single smartcard that makes travel easier and cheaper.

With smart and integrated ticketing, we have an opportunity to give passengers greater certainty over their end to end journey, and as a result increase the take up of more sustainable forms of travel.

Is realising that vision going to be easy?

Well, it's certainly challenging - it won't be achieved overnight, that's for sure.

But can it be done?

Absolutely. In fact, I've already asked my officials to explore ways of developing and introducing such a card.

## Partnership for a purpose

Today I've spoken about the future.

I've argued that we have no alternative but to put the public finances back on track.

I've made the case for decarbonising transport.

And I've stressed the vital importance of improving the connectivity of our transport networks - especially through the use of cutting edge technology such as a nationwide transport smartcard.

This isn't an exhaustive list of every last brick that we need to lay in order to build a better tomorrow for transport. But I hope the areas I've covered at least give a sense of the foundation stones we are putting in place to support that future structure.
Before I conclude I'd like to make one final point - and it concerns working together.

I'm under no illusions - this Government and my Department can only get so far working in isolation. If we are to succeed then we must collaborate in a productive partnership with the key stakeholders and major players in transport - people and organisations like you.

So I want you to know that this Minister intends to listen to you, learn from you and work with you. Your ideas and input will be valued, as well as welcomed. And let me be clear - this is not partnership for its own sake, but partnership for a purpose because, ultimately, such a partnership is the only way to build that better future.

## Concluding Remarks

Okay - when it comes to public speaking I'm always conscious of the wise advice offered by the 19th century Liberal politician Lord Reading, who said:  ""Always be shorter than anybody dared to hope"".

Well today you can be very hopeful - you have a jam-packed schedule and a busy day in front of you so, with Lord Reading's words ringing in my ears, it's time I brought my speech to a conclusion.

It only remains for me to thank you for listening and to say that I look forward to hearing your thoughts and taking your questions in the Q&A session.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20100929,Speech to New Civil Engineer Rail Summit,"Speech by the Rt HonTheresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Thank you for that welcome, Antony.

I'm delighted to be able to join you today.

Bringing together leading rail experts with specialists from other disciplines and backgrounds... this conference has become an important date in the railway calendar.

In my contribution this morning, I want to explain why we need a reassessment of how we run our railways in this country.

And I would like to outline the direction in which the Government is going towards delivering a pragmatic programme of reform to meet the key challenges of capacity, affordability and sustainability in the years ahead.

Because the Coalition has put rail at the heart of its transport strategy.

We fully recognise the economic importance of both passenger and freight services.

And we also acknowledge that both freight and passenger rail can help us achieve our carbon and congestion goals.

## The cost of the railways

The previous Government used to highlight again and again the amount of taxpayers' money going into the railways.

Between 1993 and 2009, the taxpayer's contribution to running the railway more than doubled.

And there can be no doubt that the rail industry has achieved some major successes in the years since privatisation.

The dramatic growth in passenger numbers is an achievement worth celebrating.

And punctuality has gradually recovered from the post-Hatfield crisis to reach record levels.

For example, the most recent industry figures show C2C delivering the best ever performance for a train operator with a PPM score of 98.8%.

But while this is all very welcome, the inescapable fact remains that the cost of running the railways has risen dramatically over the past 15 years.

In rail, as in so many other areas of the economy, a failure to achieve value for money during the boom years has left the country with some very difficult questions to address now the lean years have arrived - not least the largest budget deficit in Britain's peacetime history.

And the painful fiscal hang-over we're suffering will impact on the railways as it will on all other areas of the Government's activities.

Our challenge is to deliver more for less.

To deliver an efficiently managed railway that plays its part in the Government's three biggest priorities:

...re-energising our economy

...addressing the debt crisis

...and delivering our commitments on climate change.

And if we're to do that we first need to find out why the railways cost so much to upgrade, maintain and operate.

We are aided in this by the work underway by Sir Roy McNulty... who I gather is speaking at this conference tomorrow.

Although the McNulty Review was an initiative set up by our predecessors, the new Government fully appreciates the value and importance of the study.

That is why the Secretary of State asked Sir Roy to bring forward the publication date for his early conclusions.

But even prior to publication of Sir Roy's report... there are some important themes emerging from the long running debate on the future of our railways.

It seems to me clear that we need greater clarity of the respective roles of Government and industry.

And we need to find a way to give the professionals who run the railways more freedom to get on with their job without Whitehall looking over their shoulder all the time.

In setting out a programme for change, I'd like to touch on three areas today:

Firstly, reform of franchising.

Secondly, a realignment of industry incentives and reforming Network Rail.

And thirdly, cost effective delivery of upgrade and enhancement programmes.

## Reform of franchising

Turning to my first theme, we recently published the consultation document on reforming rail franchising.

The proposals are aimed at moving away from a system which sees Whitehall specifying highly detailed and prescriptive inputs in franchises.

Let me emphasise that this won't let operators off the hook on performance.

Franchises let under the new system will set demanding outcomes for train operators to achieve - including standards to be met on passenger satisfaction.

Those who fail to meet those standards will face sanctions.

The shift we want to see is away from a detailed specification of input to a stronger focus on the quality of _outcomes_ for passengers...

...while giving more flexibility to the professionals who run our railways to apply innovation and enterprise in working out the best way to _deliver_ those outcomes.

We also need a more qualitative approach to assessment of franchise bids...one which judges the quality of the overall package of proposals they contain to invest in the railways, reduce costs and grow passenger numbers - rather than focusing solely on the binary question around the level of subsidy or premia to be paid.

We clearly need to reform the cap and collar regime.

The way the 80% revenue support system currently works is undermining one of the main reasons for involving the private sector in the first place - namely to harness its expertise to attract passengers to the railway and grow revenue.

Both Coalition Parties have long advocated longer franchises.

We expect 10 to 15 years to become the normal expected length,with the possibility of franchises running for up to 22 and a half years where significant investment is promised.

And we are looking at ways to make it easier for operators to receive part of the value of their investment at the end of the franchise, to lift another barrier to private sector funding of the railways.

I firmly believe that the increased certainty provided to train operators by a longer franchise will encourage private sector investment in the railways to help us deliver the improvements that matter most to passengers...

...such as better services, better stations, longer platforms and better rolling stock.

Longer franchises will also enable train operators to invest in the long term _relationships_ crucial to ensuring the railway works well...

...relationships with their workforce and with Network Rail.

This advantage is often overlooked but is an important one.

As well as providing greater scope to address long-standing industrial relations issues which may be just too difficult with a short franchise, this aspect of franchise reform can also make a useful contribution to our strategy on Network Rail and improve the interface between the train operators and the infrastructure provider.

## Reform of Network Rail

And that brings me neatly on to my second theme today.

We desperately need an infrastructure provider that's more responsive to its customers, and able to deliver a high quality service at reasonable cost.

And it is - of course - crucially important to have regard to the interests of both of Network Rail's customer groups...

...the freight operators as well as those who provide passenger services.

I recognise that Network Rail has made some welcome progress in recent years, particularly on punctuality and reliability.

But I am afraid that a number of mistakes were made when Network Rail was established.

To keep the company's debt off the Government's balance sheet, a structure was created without strong enough accountability mechanisms.

While I fully recognise the valuable work the regulator has done within the constraints of the current framework...lack of rigorous enough accountability mechanisms must be one of the reasons why the pressure to reduce costs has not been strong enough to deliver the efficiencies we need.

Not even the high levels of taxpayer support we have witnessed in recent years have succeeded in turning the company into the modern, customer-oriented organisation that freight and passenger operators have been crying out for.

That fact was driven home earlier this month when the ORR published international data which showed that Network Rail is still well behind comparable European rail infrastructure companies, with an efficiency gap of 34 to 40%.

Now we all know that views tend to polarise whenever reform of the railways is discussed in this country.

But it seems to me that a degree of consensus is starting to gather around the certain propositions.

There is a widespread acceptance that a key driver of high whole-industry costs is the lack of a joined-up focus on costs and revenues, with no direct link between revenues that accrue to train operators and the infrastructure costs incurred by the industry.

It seems increasingly clear that an important part of the solution to the problems we face rests in aligning the interests of Network Rail and operators more closely...

...and providing more effective ways to get them working together to innovate and reduce costs.

I have long recognized the value of a model that sees a more decentralised Network Rail, with its component parts working more seamlessly with local train and freight operators.

Drawing on the conclusions of the McNulty Report, we will be working closely with the ORR to do more to unify and improve the way Network Rail and operators are regulated, and to help them work together more effectively.

Our goal is to ensure the entire rail industry becomes more accountable and answerable to those who fund it... passengers, freight customers and taxpayers... all of whom deserve better better value for money in return.

I believe that if we get this point right, it will be a very valuable step forward in addressing a range of other cost drivers and improve the industry's performance on issues like

...asset management

...supply chain management

...and stations and property.

And greater efforts are also needed to ensure that engineering work reflects the needs of the job at hand and not simply a one-size-fits-all manual of how work should proceed.

We should also assess whether current standards which are uniformly applicable across the industry could be better adapted to the differing requirements of a railway network which performs diverse functions.

And finally, it seems clear to me that we need a rational and objective appraisal of whether the railways' very impressive safety record can be delivered in a more efficient way.

## Major projects

But reform alone is not enough to ensure that the railways meet the needs of 21st century Britain.

We must also continue to develop and enhance the network to address overcrowding and meet the longer term economic and environmental challenges of tomorrow.

As everyone here will appreciate only too well, the programme of upgrades we have inherited from our predecessors is under review as part of the CSR process.

The crisis in the public finances will inevitably impact on these programmes - some of which were promised without a clear idea of how they might be funded, despite the deteriorating public finance position.

However... there can be no doubt that where we get rail infrastructure projects right, they can be among the best value investments that the taxpayer can make - providing economic benefits many times their cost.

The Chancellor made it clear in his Emergency Budget speech that:

_""Well judged capital spending by government can help provide new infrastructure our economy needs to compete in the modern world""._

He also confirmed in the Budget that the Coalition would not seek additional cuts in capital spending over and above those already set by the outgoing administration.

Now you'll appreciate that there are significant limits on what I can say prior to the outcome of the spending review.

But there are some general themes that underlie our approach.

As ever, we need to strive continually to improve Government procurement skills.

For example, we need to learn lessons from the IEP programme, which saw over £6 million being spent in consultancy and preparation costs without even getting as far as contractual close, never mind any trains coming off the production line.

And every programme needs to be tested and re-tested at every stage - and along every mile - to reduce costs and improve value.

A prime example of the application of this principle is to be found in the Crossrail project.

We have made clear our support for Crossrail, because we believe it can be a significant growth generator, with real economic benefits felt far beyond London.

Construction work is under way, and highly visible at various locations in the capital.

We are working closely with Crossrail Ltd and with the Mayor and TFL to get the very best return for money invested in the project.

CRL has already been successful in identifying savings through reducing staff and administration costs and renegotiating IT contracts.

You may have read of their further ideas on saving money with a more 'off-the-shelf' train and re-design of a stations like Canary Wharf and Whitechapel.

The ongoing challenge now facing all those involved in the project is to continue to find efficiencies through risk mitigation, more effective procurement, and value engineering.

The same goes for Thameslink.

Although this project has never attracted the same political attention as Crossrail... this important upgrade to the infrastructure of the south east can play a key part in relieving overcrowding and supporting economic growth.

Major work on this project is now underway at Blackfriars and Farringdon and the first longer 12 car trains are due to start on the Bedford to Brighton route from December 2011.

Progress is also being made on the long-awaited Birmingham New Street redevelopment. At long last the station is being transformed into a gateway worthy of serving the UK's second largest city. It is set to provide a major boost to regeneration in Birmingham and across the Midlands.

Time prevents me from running through all the pending upgrade programmes.

But I should highlight that we fully recognise the benefits that would accrue with the progress on the Strategic Freight Network.

...and I would also emphasise that the Coalition Agreement affirms our support for further electrification of the rail network.

...although the pace of delivery will depend on what is affordable in the current climate.

## High Speed Rail

But the last of the rail projects I would like to consider today is of course, high speed rail.

We will shortly announce detailed plans for a future high-speed rail network, with a view to starting a public consultation in the New Year.

The commitment the Conservatives made to high speed rail in 2008 transformed the debate on the future of long-distance transport in Britain.

Demand for travel between major conurbations is set to grow rapidly over the next 20-30 years, and we need a solution that's fast, reliable, accessible, and environmentally sustainable.

The work we inherited from our predecessors focuses primarily on London to Birmingham - but we also intend to set out a clear plan for delivering high speed rail to Manchester and Leeds.

This will provide the foundation of the genuinely national network we want to see delivered in the future.

Planned and developed by Michael Heseltine during the last Conservative Government, HS1 gives us a taste of what high speed rail can deliver.

Integrating airports such as Birmingham and Heathrow into the new network can help us reduce emissions from transport by providing an attractive alternative to thousands of short haul flights.

And there is every reason to believe that we will soon see new operators, including international carriers, operating alongside Eurostar, serving new destinations like Amsterdam and Frankfurt, and improving connectivity between London and Europe.

## Conclusion

Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, the days ahead are going to be difficult.

I am delighted to have an opportunity take part in one of the keynote events of the transport calendar.

## Bus friendly, bus focused

It is said that a myth can be half way around the track before the truth has even got its running shoes on.

Actually, I've witnessed that for myself in recent weeks. You see, during this period leading up to the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), a myth seems to have gathered pace about the Coalition's commitment to buses.

Now, in some ways that's perhaps understandable. After all, by its very nature, the weeks between the announcement of a spending review and its final publication provide a vacuum for rumour and speculation.

None-the-less, it can be a touch frustrating when ill-informed guesswork is presented in some quarters as hard facts. Take the Bus Service Operators' Grant (BSOG).

In response to various stories doing the rounds on BSOG I made a statement in the Commons in June to reiterate my view that ""_the benefits of that grant are clear_"". And they are - from helping to keep fares affordable, to attracting more people onto public transport, to incentivising fuel efficiency.

Now of course, in terms of specific details about what we can spend and where we can spend it in the coming years, all of us - ministers, media and industry stakeholders - will have to wait for the unveiling of the CSR's contents later this month. And I'll say more about this in a moment.

Bus travel accounts for two thirds of public transport journeys. Buses are an essential public service - especially where rail travel isn't an option or where people are on low incomes and cannot afford alternatives like car ownership.

So our buses matter - socially, economically, and of course, environmentally. And that's why you have a Minister, a Department and a Government that is bus friendly and bus focused.

## The Status quo is not an option

You may have guessed there's a ""but"" coming - and here it is.

**But**, that doesn't mean that I view the industry through rose-tinted glasses.

First, last and always I am a bus realist.

And, as a realist I know that, even though these days we live and work in a world where the only constant is change, there is one certainty that the bus industry must face up to - namely, that the status quo is not an option.

If there is any lingering doubt that things can continue as they are without let or hindrance, reform or renewal, then that doubt is surely dispelled by one of the greatest challenges facing all of us - the inherited debt crisis.

Imagine for a moment what would have happened if, on taking office, the Coalition Government had chosen to ignore the inherited debt crisis - if we'd adopted a sit-on-our hands, turn-a blind-eye approach to the massive hole in Britain's finances.

Well, on the spending plans bequeathed to us by our predecessors, British taxpayers would be paying out £70 billion in debt interest a year by the end of this Parliament - that's more than we spend on educating our children, defending our country or policing our streets.

That would not just have been unsustainable - it would have been unforgivable. So, instead, we have taken action to get the debt under control and put Britain's finances back into good order.

I've already touched on the next step in our journey to fiscal discipline and economic growth - this month's Spending Review

Now of course, in terms of specific details about what we can spend and where we can spend it in the coming years, all of us - ministers, media and industry stakeholders - will have to wait for the unveiling of the CSR's contents later this month.

But, whatever the outcome of the CSR, one thing is certain - the inherited debt crisis has radically altered the economic landscape. And that's as true for the bus industry, as it is for every other aspect of our national existence.

What does that mean as we move forward?

Well, it means that the industry has to recognise that things are going to have to change - quickly, radically and permanently.

So you will have to squeeze every last ounce of value out of your existing assets.

You will also need to get more from less

The Government is shining a light into every last nook and cranny of transport expenditure.  Everything is being examined and re-examined. Everything is on the table. There are no sacred cows.

Now, before you take fright let me assure you of the central objective of government policy on buses - we want to see more people using buses

Here comes another ""but""

**But** we are equally determined that taxpayers and fare-payers should get the best deal and the best value for their money.

And here are three facts which remind of us of just how important this issue is:

Fact one - bus fares increased by 24% above inflation in England outside London between 1997 and 2009

Fact two - bus patronage in England outside London fell by approximately 2% over the same period. Coincidence? I think not

And fact three - public funding of buses has been increasing year on year. £1.5 billion of public money is now spent on buses each year, and that of course, excludes concessionary fares. That's a lot of money - it's a serious issue.

## Progress but more to do

I recognise that there is much good work going on in the bus industry to improve services.

Welcome progress is being made - but there is still more to do. And that's because, as I've said, the Government has a growth agenda, not a cuts agenda, for the buses.

And attracting new customers isn't simply about purchasing expensive new vehicles, as important as that may be.

  * It's also about improving drivers' skills leading to safer and more fuel efficient driving.
  * It's about providing good accessible information at bus stops, on buses and on-line so that people can easily find out about services.
  * It's about making sure the bus turns up at the scheduled time.
  * And it's about continuing the good work bus companies are doing to train their drivers to deal with the diverse range of customers who use their services. They've been huge improvements in the customer focus of train operators and I'd like to see that best practice spread to our buses too.

All this will lead to good quality bus services which offer the best value for money to the customer and the taxpayer, and which driver up patronage too

What's more, all of these things are achievable, even in these difficult times. But we must all work together to bring them about..

That includes more partnership working between operators and local authorities. Operators tell me they want to work with local authorities and in some parts of the country this has been highly successful, in others area not so.

By working together I am sure we can make the progress that we all want to see.

## Climate Change

Just like the inherited debt crisis, there is another challenge that cannot be side-stepped or wished away - climate change.

If left unchecked climate change imperils the future of our planet. And that's not science fiction, it's science fact.

And let me be absolutely clear - the focus needed to deal with the debt crisis can be neither reason nor excuse for taking our eye off the climate change ball.  Again, the status quo is not an option - either for the Government or for the industry

So make no mistake - not only is this Government determined to lay the foundations for a stronger economy, we are committed to safeguarding our shared environment.

Underpinning that commitment is a belief that public transport has a key part to play in offering people a cleaner and greener alternative to car travel - an alternative that is both viable and reliable.

That's precisely why one of the first things I announced after taking up my post was an additional £15 million investment in low carbon buses.

Buses help to ease congestion on our roads, as well as that, low carbon buses emit nearly a third less carbon than their conventional counterparts. That's a transport win-win as far as I'm concerned.

Yet, as things currently stand, just 0.2 per cent of buses on the road are of the low carbon variety. So I want the bus industry to step up to the plate by doing all that it can to make these green buses the norm on our streets, rather than the exception.

I'm convinced that the  £15 million of new funding we're providing gives the industry a key means of doing this:

  * Firstly, because it will stimulate the market for low carbon buses by reducing some of the initial costs for operators.
  * And secondly, because it will help spread best practice by requiring the winning bidders to share information with others in the industry.

Thanks to our decision to stand in the vanguard of the green technology revolution over 150 new low carbon buses will join fleets throughout England - a move that will save around 50,000 tonnes of CO2  (over a 15 year period).

The closing date for bids under the Round 2 of the Green Bus Fund was 5th October. We have received a good response and are currently assessing the bids. We will be announcing the winners soon so watch this space.

## Localism

It was Ronald Reagan who, as only he could, said - ""the status quo is simply Latin for the mess we're in"".

Well if there was ever a status quo that has caused one almighty mess in this country then it is decades of centralism. Here too the status quo is not an option.

Years of stifling top down bureaucracy and Whitehall diktat are being consigned to the political and constitutional dustbin by a Coalition Government committed to localism.

For us, localism is the political recognition that the best form of government is the government that lets people govern themselves.

It means that decision-making is devolved and power is dispersed.

And it ensures that problems are more easily defined and solutions more easily developed.

Localism works. It's also important for the future of our buses. And that's because it offers a way for local authorities and bus operators to work in a productive partnership - a partnership that helps improve bus services and attract new customers.

Better bus services can never be delivered through a one-size-fits-all approach. Every local community is different.

So, if they are to be efficient and profitable, then bus services must be designed to meet the specific of needs specific local communities. They must be individually tailored, not off the peg.

This is what lies at the core of bus localism. But, as well as offering bespoke services, bus localism also means ensuring value for money.

I'm committed to getting the best deal for bus passengers and for taxpayers. I therefore I welcome the current Competition Commission inquiry into the local bus market. In my view, the Commission is best placed to consider the difficult questions about the level of competition between bus operators and whether the current regulatory framework for buses is the right one.

My Department has already submitted evidence to the Competition Commission, and will engage fully as the process continues before its final conclusions next year.

## Smart and integrated ticketing

Before I conclude I'd like to talk about one final area where the status quo is very definitely not an option - the ""door to door journey"".

Today's passengers demand and deserve a public transport system that is properly joined up in a way that reflects the demands of their daily lives.

So whether, as I have, you call it the ""door to door journey"", or you label it ""end-to-end travel"" or the ""whole-journey experience"", it is absolutely vital that we improve the journey from front door to final destination.

And again, the bus industry must play its part.

Innovations such as real time information displays at bus stops, or even something as simple as placing bus stops as close as possible to the main rail station entrance can make a difference.

But I believe that one of the most important steps towards a more joined up transport network is smart and integrated ticketing.

The Government wants this new technology to be rolled out more widely across England and so we have provided £20 million of grant funding to the nine biggest English urban areas outside London to support this.

My Department has also offered a BSOG incentive of 8% for operators with operational ITSO smart systems on their buses.

Additionally, we are continuing our support of ITSO Ltd as the organisation that can help facilitate the additional roll out of schemes - and I can tell you that we are working with Transport for London and their partners to achieve ITSO compatibility across the London estate.

I'm pleased to say that major bus operators are rolling out ITSO smart ticketing across their fleet - something that is good for integration and, as a result, good for passengers.

I want to congratulate Stagecoach and Go Ahead in particular for announcing their plans to roll-out ITSO smart ticketing across their fleets and I encourage others to follow their example!

Progress is being made on smartcards. But, I'm eager to see much more achieved. Indeed, my personal vision is of a system where we have seamless travel on one smartcard throughout the country.

  * A single smartcard that you can use whether you are in Bristol on the bus, on the Tube in London or on the Metro in Newcastle.
  * A single smartcard that lets you hire a bike or join a car club.
  * A single smartcard that can be topped up in shops, online or by phone.
  * A single smartcard that makes travel easier and cheaper.

Is realising that vision going to be easy?  Well, it's certainly challenging, and it won't be achieved overnight. Already, though, officials in my department are investigating how it might be done. Make no mistake - we are firmly set on this direction of travel.

## Concluding remarks

Friends, in speaking to you today I have argued that standing still is not an option for the bus industry. There are reality checks to acknowledge, big challenges to confront and real changes to make.

I realise therefore that these are testing times. But I also know that if anyone can be equal to them, then it's the bus industry and the people who work in and lead it. And that's why I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.

Thank you.

Thank-you Quentin.

And thank-you ladies and gentlemen.

It's a very great pleasure to be here today - and to be part of a conference that reflects the crucial role that the fleet industry plays in reducing carbon emissions from road transport.

By some considerable distance, you represent the largest market for green vehicles in this country.

Without the purchasing power of fleets, how could diesel car sales have grown so dramatically since the 1980s? How could hybrids have become a common sight on our roads today? And without fleets, how could we hope to establish sustained commercial demand for low carbon vehicles in the future?

So fleets matter. But it's not just the size of your collective chequebook that gives you such enormous influence.

It is also your pioneering reputation for adopting new green practices to reduce fuel consumption; for trialling cutting edge vehicle technologies on the road; and for helping to jump-start a wide range of green fleet management schemes.

While much of the debate on tackling climate change focuses on long-term solutions, fleets are helping to make an active, practical and deliverable contribution today.

So I am particularly grateful to Fleet News and the Energy Saving Trust for asking me to speak about the Coalition Government's plans for a greener road transport sector.

## Greener economy - greener cars

In fact, the two biggest priorities of the Coalition Government are sorting out Britain's financial problems, and developing a greener, low carbon economy.

We believe these priorities are complementary, not contradictory

Cutting our spending doesn't have to be incompatible with a low carbon agenda. Some low carbon choices already offer outstanding value for money - as the fleet industry knows - so our future goal is a market for green vehicles that makes economic as well as environmental sense.

Just as cars and vans are key today, so they will be key in the low carbon economy tomorrow.

Fleets understand that no other form of transport offers the flexibility, the cost-effectiveness, and the ability to carry people and goods between two specific locations.

The enemy is not the car, but the carbon.

That's why a key part of any strategy to reduce transport's emissions is making sure that the cars we drive are as clean and fuel-efficient as possible.

In the short term, the majority of CO2 savings from road transport will come from improvements to conventional technologies, driven mostly by EU regulations on fuel efficiency.

So we will continue to work with manufacturers - and with the European Union - to squeeze more fuel efficiency out of petrol and diesel cars and vans today.

## Biofuels

Alongside more efficient vehicles, we also need to keep developing greener fuels - and there is no doubt that biofuels have an important part to play in the overall mix of measures to decarbonise transport.

They remain a complex and controversial area though. And it is clear to me that, while there are many good biofuels, such as used cooking oil, there are also many biofuels which deliver no environmental benefits whatsoever, particularly when indirect impacts are taken into account.

I have discussed these issues with stakeholders who have impressed on me their strong views - both about the benefits and also about other wider implications of biofuels use, such as concerns over indirect land use change.

Given this, I believe that it is right that the Government should take some additional time to review this subject carefully, to ensure that policy decisions going forward are robust and stable, and so we can provide a clear long-term direction for biofuels.

## Low carbon vehicles

Biofuels represent an important but limited evolution in the greening of the passenger car and the van.

But we are also preparing for a much more revolutionary change...

After more than a century in which the internal combustion engine dominated, the ultra-low carbon vehicle era is beginning...

Order books for the first new generation, all-electric vehicle - the Nissan Leaf - have opened in the UK and the first vehicles will be on our roads early next year, imported from Japan. But with Government support, it will not be long before they will be rolling off production lines in Sunderland. And others will follow.

Of course the take-up of ultra-low carbon cars will be slow at first. But we hope that fleets will play an integral role in establishing a market for these pioneering technologies, supported by measures such as enhanced capital allowances, low benefit in kind taxation, and vehicle excise duty.

Indeed, some fleets are already helping to do exactly that. The Royal Mail, for example, is trialing electric vans, and Sky is seeing what the Plug-in Toyota Prius is like to live with. Within my own Department, the Government Car and Dispatch Agency is also testing five plug-in Toyotas and a Smith electric van.

But to further support the development of the market for low carbon vehicles, we need to ensure that the right infrastructure, specialist supplier base, and customer incentives are in place.

And that's exactly what we are doing.

We have confirmed our support for a range of R&D programmes across the green vehicle sector.

Through the Technology Strategy Board's Low Carbon Vehicles Innovation Platform, we are working with key partners to deliver a strategic vision for automotive R&D.

We recently announced that a further £24 million is being awarded to six winning consortia of the Competition - making a total of £52million with contributions from business - all of which will make a significant contribution to greener vehicle development in this country.

They include hybrid technologies; composite materials; and engines that recover waste heat energy; and the vehicles that will benefit include plug in hybrids for Nissan, Lotus and Jaguar/Land Rover, extended range electric cars, and a lightweight hybrid refuse collection vehicle.

And through the Plug in Car Grant, we have announced consumer incentives for every ultra low emission car sold. From January next year buyers will receive a grant of 25% of the price of a green car, up to £5,000. And this will of course also apply to fleet buyers.

Through these initiatives, we want to encourage motorists and fleets to embrace cleaner and greener vehicles. By encouraging demand, we will stimulate investment in mass production which, in turn, will bring down costs and further boost demand.

And we are also committed to rolling out an effective infrastructure for electric vehicles - hence the inclusion in the Coalition Agreement of a commitment to mandate a national recharging network.

Our Plugged in Places programme is helping us do just that. The scheme will provide valuable data about how and where people recharge their cars, so that we can get the design of the national network right.

To date, £8.8 million has been awarded to London, Milton Keynes and the North East through the Programme. We plan to hold a second round of bidding in the autumn, and will announce the funding available for this second round following this month's Spending Review.

Finally, all this investment would be of limited environmental value if our power sources were unsustainable.

That's why our recharging network will draw fuel from an electricity grid that Chris Huhne is determined to make one of the greenest in Europe.

## Reducing fuel consumption

Technology and cleaner fuels are important in reducing emissions, but they are not enough on their own. We also need to think about the choices we make, as individuals and businesses, about when, where and how we travel, and how we carry goods around the country.

These choices don't need to involve big changes to our lifestyle, or to the way businesses operate. Simple adjustments to driving technique can have a big impact on fuel efficiency - and hence profitability.

I know many fleets are already making significant reductions in their fuel bills by training drivers to drive more efficiently. This training can be delivered quickly and conveniently - as I found recently when I took a smarter driving course with the Energy Saving Trust.

In less than an hour, the Energy Saving Trust can teach even the most experienced drivers how to make simple improvements to their driving style, and I am convinced it can help reduce most drivers' fuel consumption by around 15%.

We want fleets of every type and size to consider eco-driving courses to keep fuel bills and carbon emissions down. In fact later today my Ministerial colleague Mike Penning will be announcing how we are going to work with the road freight industry to promote more eco-driving.

I am also grateful to those fleets that are helping to support car clubs, and car sharing schemes that can not only reduce commuting bills, but also prevent the office car park filling up every day.

And for short trips, nothing is more carbon efficient than a bicycle.

I want more companies to offer bikes for local journeys - to help reduce fuel bills, cut carbon, and improve the health of employees.

This is a great example of Coalition Government in action...both me and Norman Tebbit saying ""get on your bike"".

## Alternatives to travel

In the current economic climate, it is more important than ever to minimise driving costs - and if possible consider whether journeys are necessary in the first place.

It is for this last reason that I have become the first ever Transport Minister to have official responsibilities for alternatives to travel.

When this new brief was announced in the summer, I was rather pleased when it was welcomed by the Campaign for Better Transport as a ""huge step forward"", and by the CBI.

But to be perfectly honest, it is something that should have been done long before now.

Just like the fleet manager's job, the job of a transport minister has changed.

Today, you and I are not only responsible for getting people and goods from A to B.

We are also responsible for the impact of transport. On budgets. On the effectiveness of business. On the environment. And on people.

Within your organisations, you are absolutely pivotal.

You keep your businesses mobile. But increasingly, you can also help identify alternatives to travel that can significantly reduce the costs of transport.

That's why in the months and years ahead I want to work with the fleet sector to support initiatives that can reduce employee travel.

And why I am working today with colleagues at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, Department for Business Innovation and Skills and in other Departments to look at reducing the demand for travel, particularly for business.

That might mean encouraging home working; staggering people's working days so roads and trains are less congested at peak times; promoting the use of high-speed broadband for both business and leisure purposes; and encouraging the uptake of video conferencing as an alternative to long-distance travel.

Of course it is not the mission of the Department for Transport to stop people travelling, but unnecessary travel is expensive in environmental and financial terms and, if we can help businesses to operate more efficiently with a need for less travel, we will be advancing both their agenda and our own.

## Conclusion

I'd like to thank Fleet News and the Energy Saving Trust for inviting me to speak at this important event.

And I'd like to thank this industry for everything you have accomplished in recent years to help cut carbon emissions from road transport.

The fleet sector has always been important, innovative and influential. But I believe you have an even bigger role to play in the future...

Helping your businesses become more efficient, and better placed to compete as we recover from the economic downturn...

Procuring greener, cleaner vehicles, and supporting the growth of ultra-low carbon technologies...

Reducing fuel consumption, and improving driver training...

And getting involved in broader schemes to cut carbon - like car clubs, or cycling to work.

I look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead. So what we do as a Government helps you do your job more effectively. And so what you do as fleet managers helps me to do my job more effectively.

Thank-you for listening.

It is a great pleasure to be here with you to celebrate what I believe is an important step forward for international rail travel.

Sixteen years after Eurostar began offering services from London to Paris, the countdown begins today towards a future of direct high speed rail services from St Pancras International to other key destinations in Europe.

The benefits of the services proposed are clear:

I'm sure they will offer passengers high levels of comfort, convenience and reliability.

Current services on HS1 have an average delay of just 6 seconds.

The new services would give passengers greater choice, including competition with Eurostar on the Brussels route.

They would help meet rising demand for travel between our two countries, and connect Europe's two most important financial centres.

In strengthening ties between the UK and Germany and London and Frankfurt, they will supporting economic growth and increased cross border investment and trade.

And they will deliver these important economic benefits in a way which is consistent with the government's convictions to reduce carbon emissions from transport and meet our goals on climate change.

I've always been an advocate of making the switch from air to rail, and I am certain that these services will provide an attractive alternative to short-haul flights, as has proved to be the case in so many other parts of Europe with the expansion of high speed rail services.

The UK Government strongly backs high speed rail as the most effective, efficient and sustainable form of long-range inter-city transport for the 21st century.

Demand for travel between major conurbations in this country is set to grow rapidly over the next 20-30 years and we need a solution that's fast, reliable and carbon efficient.

The Government believes that high speed rail can provide that solution.

Indeed, the commitment the Conservatives made in Opposition to high speed rail transformed the debate on this form of travel in Britain.

Earlier this month, we followed up on that commitment by confirming our plans for a national high speed rail network in the UK, initially linking London, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds.

And linking airports such as Birmingham and Heathrow into the network will help support the growth of high speed services to European destinations.

And we look forward to working with major operators like Deutsche Bahn and Eurostar to help open up and expand the market.

Of course there will be tests and standards to meet in relation to safety, security and border controls, but the end goal should be worth the effort - achieving a vibrant, open and competitive market for international rail services through the Channel Tunnel.

In conclusion, I would like to thank Deutsche Bahn and congratulate them for the commitment they have made to this project.

And I very much look forward to being back here, at St Pancras International, in the future to mark the launch of the first direct high speed rail services between London and Germany.

Thank-you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-20101020,"""Sustainable Transport 2010"" conference","Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","## Introductory remarks

Good transport can do great things - it can change our lives and our country for the better. That's why this Coalition Government is fully focused on building a modern transport system - one that connects our communities and supports our businesses, one that is safe and reliable, affordable and accessible. And, of course, we are determined that such a system will also play its part in contributing to the Government's climate change goals.

If our transport networks are to achieve all these ends then first, last and always, they have to be sustainable. But the nub of my argument is this - if we are to achieve genuine transport sustainability, then we have to think of it as three dimensional, something solid and real.

What are these dimensions? In essence, sustainability has three prongs: economic, social, and environmental. And it's that ""three part sustainability challenge"" I'd like to speak about today.

## Economic sustainability

Let me first deal with the economic component of this challenge.

If anybody asked me to sum up the legacy bequeathed to the new Coalition Government, then I'd probably choose one word - "" **un** sustainable."" We inherited unsustainable levels of borrowing and spending which, together, added up to unsustainable levels of debt.

Well you can't build a sustainable future for transport on the quick-sands of debt - in truth, living beyond our means is not, and never could be, a recipe for a successful and properly resourced transport system in the UK. And that's precisely why this Government is taking urgent action to put the public finances back on track.

The latest milestone on our road to fiscal discipline will be the publication today of the Spending Review. And that Review is much more than an announcement of departmental budgets - it is a programme for economic sustainability.

So - what does that mean for transport as we move forward?

Well, it means squeezing every ounce of value out of existing assets.

It means finding innovative ways of funding expenditure and attracting investment.

And it means making a rigorous cost-benefit case for each and every infrastructure project and proposal.

It also means moving away from the top-down command and control system that has characterised government in Britain since the 1940s and giving power back to individuals, families and communities - what we call ""localism.""

These are not just common sense responses to the inherited debt crisis - they are the hallmarks of a genuinely sustainable transport system.

## Social sustainability

The second dimension of transport sustainability is social.

If access to transport is limited, if it's too expensive or the level of services provided is poor, then barriers can arise that prevent the least-advantaged in our society from taking part in key social activities and accessing essential public services.

But, by ensuring the social sustainability of transport, you can break down these barriers. For example, when transport is socially sustainable:

  * You can take the kids to school, and pick them up again, without having to rely on a car.
  * You can get yourself and your loved ones to the GP or the hospital.
  * You can hold down a job - or even get to the interview that wins you that job in the first place.
  * You can journey to, from and around a rural area just as easily as you can an urban conurbation.
  * And regardless of your age, physical ability or social background, you can use a value for money public transport service that gets you to where you want to go, and brings you back again - quickly and seamlessly.

To put that more succinctly - at its best, transport is a vital rung on the ladder of social inclusion.

## Environmental sustainability

So far I've argued that, when it is economically and socially sustainable, then transport can generate wealth and spread prosperity, reinforce community cohesion and open up life-changing opportunities.

But I also recognise its impact on the environment we all share, especially in terms of CO2 emissions and also on air quality and quality of life - and, that means transport must also be environmentally sustainable. Indeed, for me, this is perhaps the most important and challenging dimension of the three parts of transport sustainability.

I make no bones about it - I regard a low carbon future as the only future for Britain. What I reject though is the argument put by some that modernising transport, generating growth and safeguarding the environment are incompatible. They are not. With the right policies and the proper balance these ambitions are mutually reinforcing, not mutually exclusive.

In my view, if we want to make real and lasting progress towards environmental sustainability then we need to recognise that a cleaner, greener future can never be built through coercion, or by government dictating which particular mode of transport people should use.

Our goal must be to persuade, encourage and incentivise. And, to do that, we should use all of the policy levers at our disposal to make low carbon travel a genuine, viable and attractive choice for businesses and ordinary citizens.

But there's something else we have to do. And that's tap into the potential of the greenest travel option of all - namely not travelling. From video conferencing to the innovative use of the internet I sense that we are on the verge of radical changes in how we organise our working day and our personal lives - changes that will mean less travelling and less pollution.

## Policies and programmes

A strong economy, a fair society and an environment that's respected and protected - this is the prize offered by a truly sustainable transport system.

But to deliver that sustainability, to make it a reality, you need an effective framework of policies and programmes. And that's exactly what this Government has got.

The way we appraise and prioritise is especially important. I've said before that we will reform the way that transport projects are prioritised in England - so that schemes offering the best carbon efficiency and value for money are fully recognised. The revised approach will be launched after the Spending Review.

Now in speaking to you today about our policies and programmes I could have pointed to our commitment to light rail as a flexible, adaptable and reliable form of public transport.

Alternatively, I could have mentioned our efforts to work with industry stakeholders to de-carbonise road freight.

I could have discussed our grants of up to £5000 to stimulate the market and encourage the purchase of electric and ultra-low carbon vehicles - an investment that would help to cut the running costs for drivers and businesses, as well as shrink their carbon footprint.

Or, I could have highlighted our belief in Crossrail - a rail infrastructure project this Government regards as a significant growth generator, with real economic benefits that will be felt far beyond London.

I could even have talked about our commitment to a high speed rail network - one with the potential to radically improve Britain's strategic connectivity in a way that both re-balances socio-economic development and makes an important contribution towards meeting our environmental objectives by encouraging a modal shift from long road journeys and short haul flights.

But, instead, in what remains of my speech, I'm going to focus on something that runs through, and cuts across, each prong of the three part sustainability challenge - our new Local Sustainable Transport Fund.

## Local Sustainable Transport Fund

I've already touched briefly on the key role of localism in transport. Well, we have recently announced our plans to underpin our localism agenda with our ""Local Sustainable Transport Fund.""

This Government's belief that transport is integral to supporting economic recovery, advancing social mobility and tackling climate change is reflected in our decision to establish this new Fund.

We want to cut the congestion that gets in the way of jobs and business.

We want to encourage people to make more journeys by sustainable, carbon-friendly modes of transport - from walking to cycling, from car-sharing to public transport.

And we want to see better air quality and a cleaner environment, improved safety and healthier communities.

I believe that our new Fund can help local authorities and local communities to secure all of these benefits. It really does have the potential to be a game-changing innovation.

But there's another important aspect of this new Fund that I want to highlight - namely that it is part of our efforts to simplify the myriad of funding grants that have been issued for various projects and purposes in the past.

This system was centralised, bureaucratic and inflexible. It was synonymous with an out-dated, top-down, Whitehall-knows-best culture.

So let me be clear - we will not be setting conditions as to what schemes we are prepared to support through the Fund, provided they are affordable, deliverable and meet the high level requirements of helping the economy and cutting carbon. There is no set menu.

Instead, it will be for local authorities - working in partnership with their communities, with neighbouring authorities, transport providers and transport users, health service organisations, environmental groups and local people - to decide on the right solutions for their area. Solutions that will be efficient, effective and sustainable - solutions informed, shaped and driven by localism.

## Concluding Remarks

I started my speech by arguing that transport sustainability was anything but a single issue concept. It's about our environment - certainly. But it's also economic and social too.

That's the three dimensional reality of transport, and delivering in each of those dimensions is the sustainability challenge we face.

Will meeting that challenge be easy? Definitely not. It will be tough and it will be testing.

So can we succeed? Absolutely yes - with fresh thinking, news ways of working and the right policy solutions it can be done.

But success will also require partnership working.

And when I say ""partnership"" I mean it. From the town hall to Whitehall, from the business community to wider civic society and from the high street to Downing Street - I want to see partnership for a purpose, partnership for progress.

And believe me, both as a local councillor and as a Minister, I've come to learn that this kind of partnership working isn't some path of least resistance taken by politicians just to make life easier - it's actually the best way to achieve goals, realise ambitions and get results.

Okay, if there's one thing you learn pretty quickly in my business it's that the tribute, ""I wish they'd gone on longer"" is rarely paid to a public speaker - especially a politician.

So it just remains for me to thank you for listening, to wish you a great conference, and to say that I look forward to working with you all to meet the sustainability challenge in the months and years ahead...thank you.

Thank you, John, for that introduction.

It's a pleasure to be here today at one of the keynote events in the aviation calendar.

This is the first formal opportunity I have had to engage with the industry since my appointment 5 months ago. Although to those of you who know some of the leading players in UK aviation it will not surprise you to hear that that does not mean I have been left unaware of the industry's views!

Indeed, almost my first challenge as SoS for Transport was to learn to say Eyjafjallajokull. And as I spent my second day in the job shuttling between a windowless COBRA meeting room and a volley of thermo-nuclear emails from various well-known airline bosses, I was never in any doubt that aviation was going to be a key part of the brief.

I want to address you this morning at two levels: of course as representatives of the aviation industry with very specific concerns about the challenges facing your sector, but also as business people with a stake in the success of UK Plc.

Because I know that, as key figures in one of our leading industries, you will recognise the importance of getting our economy, and our public finances, back on a sustainable path.

### Economy / Spending Review

When the Coalition Government came to office, we inherited an economy teetering on the edge of an abyss.

Britain was saddled with the biggest budget deficit in the G20 and had just limped out of the longest and deepest recession in our peacetime history.

Every single day we are adding £400 million to our national debt.

And if we had kept to the spending plans we inherited, British taxpayers would be paying out nearly £70 billion a year in debt interest alone by the end of the Parliament. And the debt would still be rising as a percentage of GDP.

That's more than we spend on schooling our children and defending our country combined.

If we were to keep interest rates low, dealing with our debts was unavoidable.

Tough decisions had to be taken. And this Government is taking them.

Immediately after coming to office we identified, and cancelled, £6 billion worth of planned public spending this year - by doing the kind of things that the private sector had already done a couple of years ago in response to recession - hiring restraint, a pay freeze, cuts to discretionary spend, renegotiation of contracts.

Our Emergency Budget in June set out an ambitious four year plan to eliminate entirely our structural deficit and get debt falling as a percentage of GDP. And to do the majority of it by reductions in public spending, with less than a quarter of the fiscal consolidation being delivered through increased taxation.

And because we understand that, ultimately, only strong economic growth can secure Britain's future; and we understand that in a global economy we will only secure that growth by being competitive.

We announced a phased reduction in corporation tax, even at a time when taxes overall are set to rise.

Recognising the crucial role that private sector businesses and private investment will play in Britain's recovery.

We set up an independent Office for Budget Responsibility to bring honesty back to official economic forecasts.

And five days ago, we reached the next major milestone on our journey to fiscal and economic recovery with the delivery of the conclusions of the Spending Review - setting out precisely how we will deliver the ambitious spending reductions mapped out in the June budget.

We now have firm and fixed spending totals for government departments for the rest of this Parliament, alongside far-reaching reforms to welfare and our public services.

And as we seek to cut the bills of a decade of debt, restoring the confidence businesses and individuals need to invest in Britain, we are prioritising expenditure that will set Britain back on the path to prosperity.

That means investing in the future - prioritising the infrastructure that will secure long-term growth and a greener economy.

And we're already reaping the dividends of taking early action to balance Britain's books.

In just five months, we have moved from the danger zone with Spain and Ireland to safety -

From our credit rating being in peril, to our AAA status reconfirmed.

And with interest rates on British Government debt falling dramatically since the election and continuing to fall since the Spending Review announcement to a record low - demonstrating the restoration of market confidence in the UK.

From being on the international watch list, to getting a clean bill of health from the IMF who described the budget as 'essential' to securing the conditions for sustainable economic growth.

But now the hard work really begins, as we seek to build on that early progress, and implement the tough but fair measures that will get Britain moving again while adapting to the new economic reality.

Laying the foundations for building a strong, competitive economy for the longer term whilst delivering on our climate change targets.

I do not pretend that it will be easy.

And we do not expect it to win us short term popularity!

But we owe it to our children not to pass on to them the legacy of debt that the previous government ran up.

The decade of irresponsibility is over and we are resolved to take the tough decisions that are in our collective long term interest and to see them through.

Because we are certain that this is the way to a better future for all our people.

### Role of aviation

So growth - green growth - is the key.

And I see transport - and the aviation sector - as integral to securing that future growth.

Our airports, airlines and associated industries generate billions of pounds of economic output.

They also create, and sustain, hundreds of thousands of jobs, while bringing people, communities and countries closer together than ever before.

Now, I know you have been through some tough times in the last few years.

First, a worldwide recession that dented consumer confidence, cut passenger numbers, and hit jobs and profits.

Then an Icelandic volcano that blasted millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere, leading to unprecedented airspace restrictions across Europe.

Add that to an intense debate on the environmental impact of aviation, and the need to protect against the ever-present risk of terrorist attack, and it is clear that your industry has had its fair share of challenges.

I accept that. And I know, too, that some of you harbour fears that this government  is somehow anti-aviation.

So let me be clear: This government understands  the social and economic benefits of aviation. We understand the important role aviation plays in our economy. And we want to work with the industry to address the challenges of climate change so that aviation can play its part in securing sustainable future economic growth.

### 3rd Runway

We will not agree on everything. Our first act was to cancel the third runway at Heathrow. A decision that the majority of you will not support.

Nor has it been greeted with universal acclaim by the wider business community - although it is also true that not all businesses favoured the runway project.

In taking that decision, we listened not just to business, but also to those who would be most affected by the local environmental impacts of proposals for expanding Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.

And we carefully considered the wider environmental impacts in the context of our - and our predecessors' - clear commitments on climate change.

I believe we made the right judgement call for the right reasons.

No government with a commitment to carbon reduction targets can adopt a crude ""predict and provide"" approach to aviation capacity while aircraft CO2 remains an unresolved issue.

And no responsible government can ignore the local environmental impacts - especially noise - of airport development.
I hope we can now draw a line under the decision we have taken on runways and work together to map out how best to secure the future of the sector within the constraints that we have accepted.

Ensuring that, while that decision marks the closure of a chapter in the aviation debate, it can also mark the opening of an important new one.

### Better not bigger

Our immediate challenge is to modernise and improve our major airports - to make them 'better not bigger'.
When you travel, your first encounter with any city is often through its airport.

And, when you arrive in a country, the airport should say something positive about the kind of place that country is - a great place to visit; a great place to do business.

Our forthcoming Airport Economic Regulation Bill will help ensure that this country's largest airports always give the right greeting and leave the right memory.

And we will achieve that through better alignement of the economic incentives facing operators with the interests of passengers.

We will replace the outdated one-size-fits-all framework with a new regulatory licensing regime that is better tailored to meet the circumstances of individual airports.

And we will give the Civil Aviation Authority a new primary duty to promote the interests of passengers and a duty to encourage investment - as well as new powers to tackle anti-competitive behaviour.

Meanwhile, our South East Airports Task Force - chaired by my Minister of State, Theresa Villiers, and comprising key sector stakeholders - is looking at ways to make the best use of existing airport infrastructure and improve conditions for all users.

The initial focus of the Taskforce is action at our three biggest airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.

But we recognise the vital importance of Britain's regional airports in supporting the economies of areas outside London. Wherever they are located, all of our airports matter.

So I am delighted that the AOA is a member of the taskforce - and I hope you will continue to play an active role in it over the coming months.

And yes, Ed, it will be looking at UKBA activity and the roll out of new technology at the border as part of its work.

### Policy framework

However, I also agree with Ed [Anderson] when he calls for the Government to provide a positive policy framework for aviation.

I recognise the need for a policy framework which supports economic growth and protects Heathrow's status as a global hub as well as addressing aviation's environmental impacts, and it is my intention to develop such a policy framework over the next year or so.

And I recognise that, just as we have done with strategic roads, we need a policy not only to address the situation we face now, but to be able to look ahead to potential technological changes that will affect aviation's future  environmental impacts - both local and global.

Of course I will want to draw on the expertise of those who understand best the benefits and impacts of aviation - and the likely future development of technology.

So in the New Year DfT will issue a scoping document setting out the questions we are seeking to answer as we develop this policy.

Then we will  open a dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders to seek their views and to draw on their knowledge and experience.

My intention is to publish a draft policy document for formal consultation early in 2012.

### Climate change

Of course, any aviation policy framework we set out cannot duck the climate change debate.

We must work together to create an aviation sector that continues delivering social and economic benefits, while reducing carbon emissions.

The Committee on Climate Change has provided valuable advice about how reductions in aviation emissions can be achieved. And, building on this, my Department is working on a robust assessment of the abatement potential and cost-effectiveness of a range of different policy measures, which will inform our response to the CCC next year.

Let me clear: just as with road transport, the enemy is not the car, or the motorist - it's the carbon....

...So with aviation, the enemy is not the airlines, or their passengers. The enemy is the carbon emissions.

So I want to look at how we can incentivise the decarbonisation of air travel - and encourage businesses in the industry to invest in low-carbon technologies and fuels.

How we can lead the global debate and shape a low-emission aviation sector of the future - without disadvantaging UK airlines or UK airports.

So far, the progress that's been made is encouraging.

At the 37th session of the ICAO assembly, the UK led the way in pushing through the first global deal for the international aviation sector. The agreement reached wasn't perfect - we concede that - but it was an agreement and that in itself is a major step forward.

And as Ed highlighted, there's the AOA's own scheme to reduce ground CO2 - an innovative programme that will help airports, airlines, air navigation service providers and ground handling companies cut their emissions.

Meanwhile, we're seeing the development of aircraft that pollute less and carry more passengers; the development of lightweight composite materials; more fuel-efficient operations; the future use of sustainable biofuels - all of these have the potential to make a real difference.

With a new aircraft today typically using 70% less fuel than sixty years ago, it is clear that technology can and must provide a convincing answer to those who see demand management as the only solution in the medium term to aviation-produced carbon - just as electric and plug-in hybrid cars will, over time, provide a robust answer to those who say the car can have no place in future transport policy planning.

If technology can play a role in mitigating the carbon impact of flying, so can it too in mitigating the noise impacts that are often the principle objection to airport expansion.

Noise contours around airports have shrunk dramatically of course over the last 40 years - but at the same time, so has the tolerance of those who live in them.

I want to understand where the industry believes it can get to in the next ten, twenty, thirty years

I want to understand what technology is likely to deliver and I want to understand what scope there may be for noise-beneficial changes in operating practice, when and if the principle focus becomes noise mitigation rather than carbon reduction.

Of course, reforms to aviation taxation can play a key part in changing behaviour. But let's be frank - they can also play a key role in deficit reduction. I know the industry has serious concerns about what these reforms might look like, their impact on route viability, and their interaction with aviation's forthcoming inclusion in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

APD reform is, of course, a matter for the Treasury. But I and my officials will work closely with Treasury colleagues as the government develops its proposals.

### Security / User pays

Security is and will remain a continuing challenge to the industry and the delivery of effective aviation security must be at the heart of the aviation policy debate.

I have listened to your concerns regarding the need to reform the regulatory framework for aviation security.

And I intend to develop a new regulatory system - one where the Government concentrates on setting the security outcomes that need to be achieved, and frees up operators to devise the security processes needed to deliver them in line with EU requirements.

Further announcements, as they say, will follow in due course.

It goes, I hope, without saying that all our policy objectives will have to be met from a reduced budget. Though in the case of transport, not nearly as reduced as I had read in the newspapers it was going to be.

That is the inevitable consequence of fiscal consolidation.

We must, of necessity, review everything that the Department does and ask ourselves the questions: does it really need doing? Are we best placed to do it? Who should bear the cost?

Our plans to extend the ""user pays"" principle will shift costs and responsibility for certain activities - sometimes to the independent regulator; sometimes to the industry itself.

In some cases that will mean greater freedom and flexibility; increased scope for innovation. But with the flip-side being a direct responsibility for delivery in areas where government has previously sought to both specify and provide.

### Conclusion

These are times of challenge and change - no doubt about it.

But I know that the aviation sector has the talent, the capacity for innovation, and the determination to meet the challenges head on.

I want to see you playing a full part in our future transport strategy.

I cannot promise that we will agree on everything. But I can promise that I will continue to engage with you, with an open mind and an open door, as we develop our strategy for aviation over the coming months.

Working together we can build a prosperous and sustainable aviation industry for the future. An industry that can support our economic growth objectives, without undermining our climate change targets.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20101026,Speech to High Speed Rail Lobby Day,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Thank you for that introduction, Sir Paul.

I'd also like to thank Andrea for organising this event and I'd like to thank all of you here who have taken the trouble to come along to Parliament today to take part.

I am certain that this meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for those affected by a potential new high speed rail line to express their views and make their voice heard.

Unfortunately I can't stay for the whole debate, but the Secretary of State will join you later in the session to take part in the Question and Answer panel.

The Government is fully aware of the fears you have about the impact high speed rail could have on your homes and your communities.

Let me assure you that your local MPs are providing a strong voice for you in holding the Government to account on this.

Let me also assure you that we are listening both to your MPs and to you the communities affected by HS2 proposals.

As many of you will be aware, a few weeks ago, the Secretary of State visited the line of route recommended by HS2 Ltd.

In the series of meetings he held, he heard your views clearly and passionately expressed.

The Government fully acknowledges the importance of balancing the wider benefits of high speed rail with the local impacts on landscapes and communities.

We fully appreciate that we need to listen to the views of the communities who could be affected and we know it is essential that we address and reduce the local impact of high speed rail where possible.

We believe that careful mitigation measures can address the most intrusive local impacts to deliver an overall solution which is balanced and fair.

We have been working hard since the election to get the right solution on high speed rail.

In the Summer, the Secretary of State asked HS2 Ltd to carry out further work on links to Heathrow and to HS1 for a connection to the Channel Tunnel and Europe.

This would increase international connectivity and strengthen the potential for a switch from air to rail.

In October he announced the Government's preferred option for lines to Manchester and Leeds dividing in the West Midlands - significantly increasing the economic benefits of high speed rail.

In the meantime HS2 Ltd has been working on further ways to improve the line of route to reduce the social and environmental impact on local people.

They have been running a series of technical seminars to help local action groups understand the detailed work being undertaken on the business case, technical specifications and noise issues.

An initial report has been published which identifies a number of ways to reduce the negative consequences for communities on the northern part of HS2's preferred route.

This work is continuing and it is being informed by the points made to the Secretary of State during his visits to that route last month. So input from local communities is already having a real impact on HS2's work.

During the Summer, Philip launched an Exceptional Hardship Scheme to assist those with the most urgent need to sell their properties.

But he has also made it very clear that if a decision is taken to go ahead and a final route is confirmed, we will put measures in place to manage blight which go well beyond the current statutory requirements.

We believe that is essential if we are to achieve a successful and fair outcome in relation to high speed rail.

I would now like to set out the process going forward.

The immediate next step is that we intend to announce the package for consultation... including a preferred route between London and the West Midlands... later in the year.

The public consultation will then commence early next year.

We intend it to be a thorough and inclusive consultation.

Four of the most important issues it will cover are as follows:

First, the principle of whether new high speed rail lines should be built;

Secondly, the broad corridor for a new line;

Thirdly, the detailed route.

Fourthly, the approach to blight and how best to assist those whose properties are negatively affected by the proposals.

Let me take this opportunity to repeat what I have said again and again on this.

This is not a done deal.

The consultation is an absolutely crucial part of the decision-making process.

You can make a difference.

You can shape the outcome of this process and the decisions that will ultimately be made.

As the Secretary of State has said during his HS2 visits, he is keen for those affected to engage extensively on all questions under consideration.

So the consultation period will certainly be longer than the period generally recommended by the Cabinet Office guidance.

We expect it to last up to 5 months or thereabouts.

And we intend to reach out pro-actively to the communities affected... rather than just waiting for the responses to come to us.

So HS2 representatives will be going out into your communities with road shows and seminars to enable people to find out more about the project and talk directly to the engineers, economists and others who are working on it.

Once the consultation is completed, it will take time to collate and analyse the thousands of responses that we expect to receive.

But our aim is to be in a position to announce the Government's preferred strategy, and the route of an initial line if we choose to go ahead, by the end of 2011.

The next stage would be preparation of a Hybrid Bill.

This would involve developing the full engineering design and environmental assessment as well as drafting legislation.

We would also contact those affected to provide them with a further important opportunity to have their say during  parliamentary scrutiny of the Bill.

Our estimate is that the Hybrid Bill process would begin in late 2013.

Our objective is to achieve Royal Assent before the end of this Parliament and to begin enabling works shortly thereafter.

I know that I'm unlikely to be able to convince most of you on the merits of high speed rail but I firmly believe that it has the potential to provide us with a once in a generation chance to transform the social and economic geography of this country.

The question we have to grapple with is how to deliver these benefits without imposing an unacceptable cost on the local communities directly affected by the new network.

If we here work together I believe we will be able to do that.

I believe we can find the right way forward and reach the right decisions -  decisions which are fair to the communities represented at this meeting today.

Thank you.

It's a pleasure to be here today, and I would like to thank David Begg and his team for giving me the opportunity this morning to tell you about the progress to date on HS2 and our commitment, at a political level, to taking the agenda forward.

I'd also like to thank you for your patience, given that it is now this afternoon.

One thing I've learnt about the transport portfolio in six months is that it's never predictable!

You've already heard from Sir Brian Briscoe this morning on the work HS2 are doing to make high speed rail a reality.

I don't think there's much I can add to the excellent overview he's given you on how he and his team are going to progress this project in the coming months.

So what I want to talk to you about today is the bigger picture for high speed rail. And the political dimension to the project.

The role it plays in the Coalition's transport strategy.

The huge benefits I believe it can bring to our country.

How it fits in our wider agenda for rebalancing and rebuilding Britain's economy.

And why - even in these difficult economic times - we are committed to pursuing such a huge investment.

## Economic Context

Let me set the scene by putting our decisions in context:

You don't need me to tell you that we faced an unprecedented fiscal crisis when we came to office.

We were saddled with the biggest budget deficit in the G20 and had just limped out of the longest and deepest recession in our peacetime history.

Every single day we were adding £400 million to our national debt.

Had we kept to the spending plans we inherited, we would be paying out nearly £70 billion a year in interest alone by the end of the Parliament - more than we spend on schooling our children and defending our country combined.

If we'd let those debts go on rising, it would have led to higher interest rates, undermined confidence in Britain and put the recovery at risk.

So we have had to take tough decisions to get the deficit under control.

By cancelling £6 billion worth of planned public spending this year.

By setting out, in our Emergency Budget in June, an ambitious four year plan to eliminate entirely our structural deficit and get debt falling as a percentage of GDP.

And two weeks ago, by delivering the conclusions of the Spending Review, with firm and fixed spending totals for each government department for the rest of this Parliament, and far-reaching reforms to welfare and our public services.

And it's working already.

Our early action to balance Britain's books is already paying dividends.

Our AAA credit rating has been reconfirmed and we now have a clean bill of health from the IMF - who described our budget as 'essential' to securing the conditions for sustainable economic growth.

But that vital fiscal readjustment is only part of the story.

A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for Britain's recovery.

## Growth and importance of infrastructure investment

The challenge is to secure the growth, the jobs, the investment that will drive our prosperity in the future.

So now the hard work really begins, as we seek to lay the foundations for building a strong, competitive economy for the longer term, while delivering on our climate change targets.

And the Chancellor made clear in his Budget speech that infrastructure investment will be a key part of our approach.

We will not repeat past mistakes where governments spent too much and invested too little.

Or of indiscriminately cutting infrastructure investment - previously seen as the easy option behind which countless governments, of all persuasions, have sheltered from taking the tough decisions on current spending, and on welfare in particular.

Our recently published National Infrastructure Plan - the first ever published by a UK Government - underlines our commitment to investment in infrastructure as a platform for growth.

And transport infrastructure in particular.

The settlement Transport received in the Spending Review - £18 billion of rail investments; £4 billion in Highways Agency investment, and £6 billion on local transport investments - overall an 11% reduction in capital spending against a Government-wide 50% benchmark - the plans our predecessors put in place in their last budget - demonstrates the Coalition's commitment to prioritising the projects that will support economic growth and job creation.

That settlement also included over £750 million to fund the development of our plans for a national high speed rail network over the Spending Review period, with the bulk of capital expenditure occurring after 2015 - when, on our plans, the public finances will be back in balance.

So today I want to explain why I believe high speed rail can make a critical contribution to our economic future, as well as our climate change agenda. And talk through the processes and the politics that lie ahead.

## The Government's transport strategy

When I took over this brief, the challenge was clear: with limited resources, support economic growth and rebalancing, and support greenhouse gas reduction.

The need for a cross-modal approach was obvious.

For instance, our decision to reject new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted because of local environmental impacts and CO2 concerns, coupled with the need to ensure that the scarce capacity at our international airports is available for the medium- and long-haul routes that are vital to our economic success, inevitably points to modal shift.

The success of high speed rail across Europe has shown how effectively such links can cater for journeys that had previously been dominated by aviation.

That's why our commitment to a high speed rail network has been a key factor in taking the difficult decisions we have taken on additional capacity at London's airports.

And that's why we have said from the outset that a meaningful High Speed Rail network must include a link to our principal gateway airport.

But high speed rail isn't just about modal shift. It's also about addressing the rail capacity challenges that are facing our most congested inter-urban routes.

Reducing crowding, improving reliability, speeding up journeys, and catering for the increased demand that comes from continued economic growth.

And, of course, it is not only inter-city journeys that would benefit from a new high speed line. As long distance point to point services transfer to the new line, valuable capacity is released to meet the growing demand for longer-distance commuter travel and for services to intermediate towns.

High speed rail will be an unbeatable option for inter-urban travel. With none of the hassle of short-haul flying. Even I could not contemplate driving from London to Birmingham in 49 minutes. It took me that long to Park Royal last time I did it.

## The role of high-speed rail in delivering the Government's growth strategy

But high speed rail isn't just a central plank of our transport strategy. It is also key to our wider plans for securing sustainable economic growth.

In the short-term it has the potential to create thousands of jobs planning, constructing and operating the proposed line.

New high speed rail lines, on which construction would begin as Crossrail is completed, would also form part of a predictable pipeline of major rail infrastructure projects.

Allowing the UK supply chain to plan for the long term, reducing costs and building a skills base for the future.

In the medium term, the proposals put forward by HS2 Ltd would lead to the regeneration of significant brownfield sites in West London and Birmingham.

Further regeneration opportunities in Manchester, Leeds, the East Midlands and South Yorkshire will open up.

But in the longer term, I firmly believe high speed rail would deliver a transformational change to the way Britain works and competes in the 21st century. Just as profound a change as the coming of the original railways delivered in the 19th century and the advent of motorways did in the 20th.

It would slash journey times between major urban centres and international gateways.

It would free up capacity to enable the continuing shift of freight from roads and onto rail, reducing carbon emissions and cutting congestion.

It would allow the economies of the Midlands and the North to benefit directly from the economic engine of London and the south east, tackling the North-South divide more effectively than half a century of regional policy has done as we expand labour markets and merge the travel to work areas of our major conurbations.

Providing a railway for the 21st century.

## Recent route developments

It was the transformational potential of high speed rail that captured the imagination of David Cameron back in 2008.

And since we have been in Government, we've lost no time in developing our plans for a truly national network.

At the beginning of October, following work by HS2 Ltd, I announced that our preferred option for High Speed Rail north of Birmingham was for two separate corridors.

One direct to Manchester, and then connecting onto the West Coast main line, and the other to Leeds via the East Midlands and South Yorkshire - with stations in both areas - before connecting onto the East Coast mainline south of York.

As Brian has already said, this would reduce journey times to Manchester and Leeds to around 80 minutes - only slightly longer than many journeys across the capital.

Meanwhile, the trip from Birmingham to Leeds would be almost halved - dropping from around 2 hours today to just an hour and 5 minutes.

And by shifting long-distance services onto the new line, we would free up valuable capacity for commuter, regional and freight services on the West Coast Main Line, the East Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line.

Meanwhile, I've commissioned and received advice from HS2 Ltd on the options for the link to Heathrow, and for connecting to the wider European high speed network via the HS1 line.

## Addressing the critics

Now, I know that our plans for high speed rail are not universally popular.

If I didn't know it before, I found out doing a series of meetings in the communities through which the proposed route will run.

People claim it'll damage the environment.

That the business case doesn't stack up.

And that we'll never get this through Parliament in a million years.

Well, I am happy to take each of those challenges head-on.

## Environment

Of course, I am not blind to the environmental impacts of HS2.

And I understand that the national benefits of high speed rail have to be balanced against the impact on local environments.

That's why, in recent months, I have been visiting communities that will be affected by the proposed route. Listening to them.

And why I, personally, have been over every mile of the route with HS2 engineers, looking at the stress points; challenging the alignment; exploring different approaches to mitigating the most intrusive local impacts.

I love our countryside - its beauty and its tranquillity.

And I am determined that we will do everything we practically can to mitigate the noise and visual impacts of the proposed line and deliver a solution that far exceeds the expectations of those who would be outside the statutory blight arrangements but who are understandably apprehensive of the impact of HS2.

I intend to personally monitor the mitigation proposals - visual and acoustic - of every mile of this railway.

We have launched an Exceptional Hardship scheme for homeowners who need to relocate urgently, and whose property values have been affected by the published route proposal.

And we've committed to consulting on a further scheme to help those whose property values are significantly eroded by a high speed line.

## Business case

Of course, it's not only the route and the environmental impact that has come under scrutiny.

There are also many people who have questioned the business case for the project and, indeed, whether a line of this kind is needed at all.

Paul Plummer from Network Rail has already spoken about the capacity challenge that our inter-urban railways face.

But it seems clear to me that the question is not whether demand will increase, but what are the options for dealing with it.

Some people have argued that upgrading the existing West Coast Main Line is the best way to meet demand increases.

But I am unconvinced that that is a credible option.

First, because reliability would undoubtedly deteriorate through trying to squeeze ever more capacity out of existing, mixed-use, railway lines.

In contrast, a new high speed line could improve reliability by creating increasing segregation between different service types.

Second, trying to deliver such a massive capacity upgrade on working lines - particularly the main commuter routes into London from the north - would try the patience of the hardiest of rail passengers. Not to mention the occupiers of the very large number of houses that would need to be demolished.

We all remember the last West Coast main line upgrade.

And finally, because no upgrade of existing infrastructure can deliver the huge improvements in journey times, and step-change transformation of our economic geography, that a new high speed network would bring.

## Political consensus

And as for getting the Bill through Parliament - well, don't think I underestimate the scale of the challenge.

I've heard enough war stories over the years from colleagues who have served on hybrid Bill committees to know just how challenging it is to get them onto the statute book.

The key to the success of a project like this is cross-party consensus.

This is not a plan for a Parliament. It is a plan for a generation. And we can only invest in it if we are clear that it will proceed over four or five Parliaments, whatever the political weather.

So I'm grateful for the supportive position adopted by Opposition transport spokesmen - and of my predecessor.

I will maintain an open and constructive dialogue with them as we move forward with this exciting project.

On High Speed Rail, if on nothing else, I believe they will agree that ""we are all in this together.""

## What happens next?

Brian in his presentation to you this morning, gave you an outline of what's going to happen next.

We intend to announce the package for consultation, including a preferred route between London and the West Midlands, a corridor preference to Leeds and Manchester, and detailed plans for links to Heathrow and HS1, later this year.

The consultation we will be launching in the New Year will be as comprehensive, inclusive and wide ranging as possible... an opportunity for everyone to make their views clear.

It will cover both the Government's overall high speed rail strategy and the route of the initial London-Birmingham phase of High Speed 2.

We will analyse the no doubt numerous responses, and publish our response, setting out our proposed way forward, in December 2011, with the aim of getting the first hybrid Bill for the London-Birmingham route to Royal Assent by the end of this Parliament.

## Conclusion

There is still much that needs to be done. And I do not for one minute underestimate the challenges involved in making high speed rail a reality.

I first looked at this project through the sceptical eyes of a Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

And to those who ask how Britain can afford to invest in a project of this scale, I reply that we cannot afford not to invest in our future.
And that if we are to prosper as a nation, every part of that nation has to prosper, has to contribute.

And strategic transport projects like HS2 have a vital role in making that happen.

Even while I still held that Shadow Treasury post, I convinced myself of the strategic potential of this project.

The potential to transform the social and economic geography of Britain.

By delivering greater mobility and connectivity; slashing journey times; and becoming the mode of choice for intercity travel.

The potential to reduce our carbon footprint, shift demand from air to rail and to transform the way we use our existing railway.

Above all, the potential to tackle the North-South gap in economic growth rates, a prize that has eluded all modern governments, boosting economic growth across the whole UK and helping to secure our competitiveness in the global economy.
In short, a vital part of our plan to build a better Britain.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-201011018,Transport Futures Seminar,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you, Brian, for that introduction. It's a pleasure to be with you all in North Tyneside this afternoon.

If I may, I would like to address you at two levels today.

Of course you care about the North East and its transport, but you are also business people with an interest in the reputation and performance of UK Plc.

I want to explain to you why I think the North East has a key part to play in the economic recovery, and what I am doing to contribute to it.

Why I think the North East should be talking itself up - not doing itself down.

What we as a Government will be doing to build the balanced and low-carbon economy that's essential for our future prosperity, and what I as Transport Secretary am doing to ensure that Transport contributes to that agenda.

The long and proud industrial heritage of this region is well known.

During the 18th and 19th centuries the North East was the cradle of the industrial revolution.

And in transport heritage, it bows to no one as the home of the first public steam railway in the world, between Darlington and Stockton-on-Tees.

Then in the first half of the last century, this region went on to establish a world class reputation in everything from building ships, to mining coal, to brewing beer.

Of course, the last quarter of the 20th century presented major challenges to the heavy industrial base as the world economy began to globalise. And I am extremely conscious that the trauma of that change is still felt today.

But if we fast forward to the 21st century, and science and research, information technology, knowledge-based companies and high-tech manufacturers have become the hallmarks of the new North East economy.

We see that today, the region is one of the UK's top performers in attracting foreign direct investment, with an automotive sector worth close to £1 billion in local Gross Value Added, a third of this country's total pharmaceutical production and nearly two thirds of the UK's petrochemical industry.

And, again as Martin highlighted, from wind and solar power generation, to biotechnology and carbon capture, the North East is fast emerging as a national centre and a global leader in the key areas of green growth.
These are all achievements of which you can rightly be proud and on which you can build for the future.

Of course, I recognise that getting our economy back on a sustainable track is going to involve some very hard slog - here in the North East, and across the UK as a whole.

But at least we are now talking about getting back on course; a year or two ago, we were talking about how close we were to the abyss.

And now that our economy is on the road to recovery, Britain must face up to an unprecedented fiscal crisis.

We inherited the biggest budget deficit in the G20 and had just limped out of the longest and deepest recession in our peacetime history.

Every single day we were adding £400 million to our national debt.

Had we kept to the spending plans we inherited, we would be paying out nearly £70 billion a year in debt interest alone by the end of the Parliament.

That's more than we spend on schooling our children and defending our country put together.

Letting those debts carry on rising would have led to higher interest rates, undermined confidence in Britain and put the recovery at risk.

If we were now where Ireland is, paying interest rates of about 6% for UK gilts, we would be looking not at £70 billion a year of debt interest, but more like £180 billion - or 12% of our GDP.

So we had to take tough decisions to get the deficit under control and keep interest rates low.

By cancelling £6 billion worth of planned public spending this year.

By setting out, in our Emergency Budget in June, an ambitious four year plan to eliminate entirely our structural deficit and get debt falling as a percentage of GDP.

And a month ago, we delivered the conclusions of the Spending Review, with firm and fixed spending totals for each government department for the rest of this Parliament, and far-reaching reforms to welfare and our public services.

Already we're seeing the rewards.

AAA credit status confirmed, Britain almost a poster-child of the bond markets and accolades from economic forecasters and business organisations alike.

The independent Office for Budget Responsibility projects falling unemployment and positive economic growth in each of the next four years.

And more good news yesterday with national employment up nearly 170,000 net over the last quarter, despite public sector cuts.

In the North East, an additional 47,000 people are in work compared to a year ago.

Fiscal consolidation and the confidence that discipline in the public finances brings has been a necessary condition for Britain's recovery. But it is only part of the story.

Our really big challenge is to build on the foundations that sound public finances provide to secure the growth, the jobs, and the private sector investment that will drive our prosperity in the years ahead.

Building a strong, competitive economy for the longer term, while delivering on our climate change targets.

The Chancellor made clear in his Budget speech that infrastructure investment will be a vital part of our approach.

We are determined to avoid, at all costs, repeating the mistake of the recent past of spending too much but investing too little.

And we will not repeat the mistakes of successive British Governments by trying to fix the public finances by slashing capital spend. We have made the tough choice to tackle waste, inefficiency and to tackle head on welfare to protect infrastructure investment.

In science and technology; in power generation; in skills - but above all, in transport.

Demonstrating the Coalition's commitment to prioritising the projects that will put Britain - and this region - back in the game.

Over the next four years, we will invest over £30 billion in road, rail and local transport projects right across Britain - more than was invested in the last four years.

Our plans for a high speed rail network lie at the heart of the Coalition's transport policy and our strategy to rebalance and rebuild Britain's economy.

This ambitious and exciting project would allow the economies of the Midlands and the North to benefit directly from the global pull of London and the south east, tackling the North-South divide in economic growth rates more effectively than half a century of regional policy has done, as we expand labour markets and merge the travel to work areas of our major conurbations.

Providing better connections not just to London, but between the Midlands and the North as well.

The journey time between Newcastle and Birmingham will be cut from 3 hours to around 2 hours 20 minutes.

From London to Leeds, reduced to 80 minutes.

In short, high speed rail would deliver transformational change to the way Britain works and competes in the 21st century. In many respects as profound a change as the coming of the original railways delivered in the 19th century and the advent of motorways did in the 20th.

So since we came to office in May, we have pressed ahead with our plans.

At the beginning of October, I announced that our preferred option for High Speed Rail north of Birmingham was for two separate corridors - the 'Y' option.

One direct to Manchester, and then connecting onto the West Coast main line, and the other to Leeds via the East Midlands and South Yorkshire- with stations in both areas - before connecting onto the East Coast mainline north of Leeds to deliver improved journey times to the North East and Edinburgh.

And in the next few weeks I will launch the detailed proposals that we will consult on in the New Year - which will include a preferred route between London and the West Midlands, and a corridor preference to Leeds and Manchester.

The new capacity high speed rail delivers will be vital in addressing the rail capacity challenges that are facing our most congested inter-urban routes.

Freeing up capacity to enable the continuing shift of freight from roads and onto rail, reducing carbon emissions and cutting congestion

But there's a problem. In Britain, we have one of the most expensive railways in Europe. More expensive to build, less efficient to maintain, and more expensive to ride on compared with other European systems.

That is not acceptable.
So we will review and reform the way the rail industry functions. The way Network Rail operates. And the way franchises are let and run.

Building on the work of Sir Roy McNulty's value-for-money study, to drive efficiency in rail investment and operations, so that the railway can play its crucial part in delivering sustainable transport for the future and offer a fair deal to passengers and taxpayers alike.

I want to say something about the Intercity Express Programme, which would provide new high-speed trains for the East Coast and Great Western Main Lines.

I recognise how important this project is to this region and, as you know, we have been carrying out further value for money analysis of the programme following the review published by Sir Andrew Foster in the summer.

We are now considering a revised proposition from Agility Trains, as well as the alternatives to the IEP identified by Sir Andrew Foster.

We will take into account the huge benefits Hitachi's proposed factory in Newton Aycliffe would bring to this area, placing Britain at the heart of the European rail industry.

But, in the wake of Sir Andrew's findings, we must also be mindful of the importance of ensuring whatever decision we make delivers the best possible value for taxpayers' money - and that the commercial, legal and technical case for the decision we take at the end of the process is a robust one.

I know you are eager for a decision, and I can assure you that I will make an announcement on the future of the programme to the House of Commons at the earliest possible opportunity.

But, exciting as all the new rail investment is, a balanced and sustainable transport strategy cannot just be about rail.

We should also remember that over 80% of journeys are made by car, with our roads representing our greatest investment in national transport infrastructure.

Roads and cars have had a bit of a bad press since the focus has been on climate change, but they remain the only practicable mode of transport in many areas.

So this Government is committed to decarbonising motoring so that, while we work to meet our climate change obligations, we can ensure the car remains an integral part of Britain's future transport plans

That is why we are supporting the ultra-low emissions technologies that will see the carbon output of cars plummet over the next two decades

Our Plug-In Car Grant will give a generous consumer incentive of up to £5,000 towards the purchase of a next-generation ultra low emission car.

Our commitment to this generous subsidy, even in the face of severe public spending restraint, to kick-start the market for low-carbon vehicles has ensured that Britain will be a principle launch market for global manufacturers. Bolstering our status as a leading player in green vehicle technology.

Order books for the first new generation, all-electric vehicle - the Nissan Leaf- opened in Britain in the summer and the first vehicles will be delivered early next year.

Imported from Japan in the first instance, yes.

But with Government support, by 2013 they will be rolling off the production lines in Nissan's plant in Sunderland.

Building on the pioneering work already being done in the North East on electric vehicle development - such as by the likes of Smith Electric Vehicles in Washington.

Meanwhile, our Plugged-in Places programme - rolling out public charging infrastructure for these next-generation cars - will allow us to gather important information about the way people use electric cars.

As one of three pilot areas, the North East is playing a key role in this exciting project.

The pilot will mean that 1,300 charging points - located on streets and in car parks, and near retail and leisure facilities - will be rolled out across the region. I saw one of them in action in Newcastle City Centre this morning.

Cementing the North East's position in the vanguard of the green motoring revolution.

## Investments in NE region

But besides those major national infrastructure investments, we're also giving the green light to a number of key local and regional transport schemes that will directly benefit local commuters and businesses.

The improvements to the East Coast Main Line that will result in faster and more reliable rail services.

The £350 million upgrade of the Tyne and Wear Metro.

The £37.5 million we're investing in accelerating delivery of the Tees Valley Bus Network.

A £2.25 million grant from our Green Bus Fund to Stagecoach North East for 26 diesel-electric hybrid buses to run on routes in Newcastle.

Over £2 million in grant funding to help establish a public transport smartcard.

And today, I can announce a £2.8 million investment to increase the traffic capacity of the A19 Silverlink interchange in the short term.

This will be completed next summer, ready for the opening of the second Tyne Tunnel and work will continue in parallel on the £108 million of A19 upgrades.

## Localism / funding devolution

All these projects will give the local economy, and the local community, a vital shot in the arm. But if we are truly to unleash the growth potential of our regions, the way we deliver investment funding also needs reform.

And for this Coalition Government, the preferred reform is localism.

We want to devolve as much responsibility and funding as possible to local level - with far fewer civil servants sitting in Whitehall monitoring progress and setting targets.

In transport, that means scrapping the multiple streams of transport resource funding for local government and replacing them with just two - a formula grant which will go to all authorities to allow them to set their own priorities.

.. and a Local Sustainable Transport Fund, worth some £560 million of capital and resource, which will consolidate the remaining money in a single pot for which local authorities can bid to support their plans for their areas.

More widely, our Local Growth White Paper, published three weeks ago, takes forward proposals for our £1.5 billion Regional Growth Fund, which will be used to support projects which have significant growth potential and create sustainable private sector employment. In areas which are heavily dependent on the public sector - including transport projects.

And, we have approved the formation of 24 Local Enterprise Partnerships across the United Kingdom; bottom-up partnerships between local authorities and businesses that will give local areas the opportunity to be the masters of their own economic destiny.

I am delighted that the Tees Valley Partnership has been given the green light in the first wave of Local Enterprise Partnerships to be announced and I hope that further partnerships in the region can be taken forward in the coming months.

From a transport perspective, I want to see how local enterprise partnerships can play a role in my Department's local capital funding allocation.

I will seek to work with them and local authorities to establish a way of delegating decision-making to them to allow them to develop truly innovative transport solutions.

Helping to deliver the growth and the jobs that will get this area open for business again.

### The prize - business investment and entrepreneurship

The North East should view these challenges with confidence. It has all the right ingredients for a strong and prosperous future:

Its geography, with seaports perfectly positioned to exploit Britain's prevailing trade patterns with continental Europe

A transport infrastructure that we will continue to develop and improve, reducing journey times and cutting congestion.

And most of all, its people: a skilled and educated workforce and extensive collaboration networks where cutting edge research institutions and internationally respected universities work hand in glove with industry.

Of course, attracting the big iconic inward investors - the Nissans of this world - is crucially important.

But much of the growth, the organic growth, will come from the North East's own entrepreneurs; from the sole traders, from home grown small and medium sized businesses.

Less glamorous, perhaps, than those major overseas investments, but just as crucial to the future of UK Plc.

And this growth is real. It's happening already.

Which city has the fastest growing rate of increase of new business start ups in the UK, according to a recent Royal Mail study?

Not London. Not Birmingham. Not Manchester. But Sunderland.

### Concluding remarks

So the North East is a region with a great story to tell - one of entrepreneurship, resilience, and dynamism.

Of course, there are tough times ahead, for all of us, as we seek to readjust to this new economic reality.

But this is an area that's already demonstrated - in spades - that it can reinvent itself, in the face of adversity, to respond to change.

Continual re-invention as the world changes around us is likely to be a key hallmark of success in the global economy of the future.

And I have no doubt that the North East can, and will, rise to that challenge in the years ahead and play its part in returning Britain to the path of sustainable economic growth and lasting prosperity.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-20101124,London 2012 travel advice to Business Launch,"Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you Colin, for that introduction.

My Ministerial colleague Theresa Villiers was very sorry that she could not be here today to talk about our transport plans for the Olympics.

But it is a pleasure for me to be able to take her place.

And wonderful to see so many of you here.

Ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 Olympic Games are just 20 months away.

The excitement is already building.

And with good reason.

The last time London hosted the Olympics was just after the Second World War in 1948. Unsurprisingly, they were relatively low-key.

But the 2012 Games will be the largest international event of any kind ever held in this country...

Providing London with an unprecedented opportunity to showcase itself to the world...

Giving sport in this country a massive boost...

And - as Paul has just outlined - delivering an economic legacy for London and the UK that will be felt for decades to come.

But, as crucial as it is, delivering a successful Games isn't just about maximising economic opportunities...

And it's not just about building a wonderful new Olympic Stadium, and state of the art venues around the country...

It is also about planning ahead so we are well prepared for the broader impact that the Games will have on London...

And in particular, ensuring that people are able to travel to and from venues, and around London, as freely and comfortably as possible.

So we are absolutely clear that a safe, reliable, accessible transport system is of pivotal importance to a successful Olympic Games.

We will need to accommodate up to 800,000 spectators each day, and 55,000 athletes, officials, and members of accredited media - as well as thousands of other people involved in staging the Games.

To get some idea of total demand, there will be around 8.8 million tickets available for 16 days of Olympic events, and another 2 million tickets for 11 days of Paralympic events.

That's why there's been an ambitious programme to extend and modernise our transport infrastructure in time for 2012, which David Higgins is going to talk about in a moment.

But even with these improvements, the demands placed on our transport system during the Olympics will be huge.

We need to be well prepared to ensure that the Tube, rail, and road network can support non-Olympics demand - so the rest of London continues functioning as smoothly as possible.

That's why Travel Advice for Business is so important.

You have told us you wanted as much time as possible to prepare.

By engaging and working with you now, we can minimise the impact on your businesses, and reduce overall 'background' demand for transport during the Games.

But let me be clear... this is not about stopping you working.

It's about helping employers organise well in advance to avoid disruption, for what is a relatively short period of time.

Today you will be hearing about TAB in more detail, the tools available to you, and other ways we can help you and your businesses plan ahead...

For example, by using online information available at london2012.com to see where and when your business will be affected...... and to find advice on how you can ensure that your business runs smoothly during the Games.

Reducing general travel demand will be essential to help deal with the extra pressure on roads and transport networks.

We hope you can help us here by stopping non-essential travel, and getting people to re-time, re-route, or revise their travel plans.

So it is vital that we communicate with companies and employers right across London - so the advice can be passed on to the widest possible audience.

In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen.

I believe the 2012 Olympic Games belong to all of us. The whole of the UK.

They are our Games. And just as we will all benefit from hosting this global celebration, so we should all contribute to making it a success.

In particular, I think the business community has embraced the opportunities provided by the Games in spectacular fashion.

And I know you will play your part in helping us reduce demand for travel and transport over a few short weeks in the summer of 2012.

Make no mistake. The transport challenges we face will be real and significant.

Our planning needs to be spot on. And our communication needs to be spot on.

But by working together now, we can go a long way to avoiding disruption and overcrowding on our transport network...

So come July 2012, we are ready to host the greatest Olympic Games ever.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20101130,High Speed Rail Business Debate,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you for that introduction Patrick. It's great to be here at the NEC today talking about our plans for high speed rail. Before we start our panel discussion, I want to talk to you about the bigger picture for HS2. And the political context of the project. The central role it plays in the Coalition's transport strategy. The huge benefits I believe it can bring to the West Midlands, this country as a whole, and British business in particular. How it fits into our wider agenda for rebalancing and rebuilding Britain's economy. Why - even in a period of fiscal austerity - we are committed to pursuing such a huge investment. But, also the very strong opposition which will be articulated against the project and the importance of the business lobby in making the case for High Speed Rail.

**Economic Context** Let me first of all set the economic backdrop: As business people, you don't need me to tell you that we faced an unprecedented fiscal crisis when we came to office. We were saddled with the biggest budget deficit in the G20 and had just limped out of the longest and deepest recession in our peacetime history. Every single day we were adding £400 million to our national debt. Had we kept to the spending plans we inherited, we would be paying out nearly £70 billion a year in interest alone by the end of the Parliament - more than we spend on schooling our children and defending our country combined. If we'd let those debts go on rising, it would have led to higher interest rates, undermined confidence in Britain and put the recovery at risk. So we have had to take tough decisions to get the deficit under control. By cancelling £6 billion worth of planned public spending this year. By setting out, in our Emergency Budget in June, an ambitious four year plan to eliminate entirely our structural deficit and get debt falling as a percentage of GDP. And by delivering the conclusions of the Spending Review, with firm and fixed spending totals for each government department for the rest of this Parliament, and far-reaching reforms to welfare and our public services. Our early action to balance Britain's books is already paying dividends. Our AAA credit rating has been reconfirmed and we now have a clean bill of health from the IMF - who described our budget as 'essential' to securing the conditions for sustainable economic growth. But of course, that vital fiscal readjustment is only part of the story.

**Growth and importance of infrastructure investment** The next challenge is to secure the growth, the jobs, the investment that will drive our prosperity in the future. We must now lay the foundations for building a strong, competitive, balanced economy for the longer term, while delivering on our climate change obligations. And infrastructure investment - as the Chancellor has clearly spelt out - will be a key part of our approach. We will not repeat past mistakes where governments spent too much and invested too little. Or of indiscriminately cutting infrastructure investment - previously seen as the easy option behind which countless governments, of all persuasions, have sheltered from taking the tough decisions on current spending, and on welfare in particular. The settlement Transport received in the Spending Review - £18 billion of rail investments; £4 billion in Highways Agency investment, and £6 billion on local transport investments - demonstrates the Coalition's commitment to prioritising the projects that will support economic growth and job creation. That settlement also included over £750 million to fund the development of our plans for a national high speed rail network over the Spending Review period, with the bulk of capital expenditure occurring after 2015 - when, on our plans, the public finances will be back in balance. And today I want to explain why I believe high speed rail can make a critical contribution to our economic future. And talk through the processes and the politics that lie ahead.

**The Government's transport strategy** When I took over this brief, the challenge was clear: with limited resources to support economic growth and rebalancing, and deliver on the Government's climate change agenda. The need for a cross-modal approach was obvious. For instance, our decision to reject new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted because of local environmental impacts and CO2 concerns, coupled with the need to ensure that the scarce capacity at our international airports is available for the medium- and long-haul routes that are vital to our economic success, inevitably points to modal shift on domestic and short-haul European travel. The success of high speed rail across Europe has shown how effectively such links can cater for journeys that had previously been dominated by aviation. That's why our commitment to a high speed rail network has been a key factor in taking the difficult decisions we have taken on additional capacity at London's airports. And that's why we have said from the outset that a meaningful High Speed Rail network must include a link to our principal gateway airport and to the HS1 line to the Channel Tunnel. But high speed rail isn't just about modal shift. It's also about addressing the rail capacity challenges that are facing our most congested inter-urban routes. Reducing crowding, improving reliability, speeding up journeys, and catering for the increased demand that comes from continued economic growth. And, of course, it is not only inter-city journeys that would benefit from a new high speed line. As long distance point to point services transfer to the new line, valuable capacity is released to meet the growing demand for longer-distance commuter travel, for services to intermediate towns and for freight on the East and West Coast mainlines. High speed rail will be an unbeatable option for inter-urban travel. With none of the hassle of short-haul flying. And even the greatest petrol-head could not realistically contemplate a 49 minute London to Birmingham journey - and if he did, he'd probably need another 49 minutes to find somewhere to park!

**The role of high-speed rail in delivering the Government's growth strategy** But high speed rail isn't just a central plank of our transport strategy. It is also vital to our wider plans for securing sustainable economic growth.

In the short-term it has the potential to create thousands of jobs planning, constructing and operating the proposed line. A fifteen to twenty year programme to roll-out new high speed rail lines, on which construction would begin as Crossrail is completed, would also form part of a predictable pipeline of major rail infrastructure projects. Allowing the UK supply chain to plan for the long term, reducing costs and building a skills base for the future.

In the medium term, the proposals put forward by HS2 Ltd would lead to huge regeneration opportunities here in Birmingham, in London and in due course in Manchester, Leeds and South Yorkshire.  For example, the major regeneration area of Eastside would find itself right at the heart of Britain's national transport infrastructure. But in the longer term, I firmly believe high speed rail would deliver a transformational change to the way Britain works and competes in the 21st century. As profound a change, perhaps, as the coming of the original railways delivered in the 19th century and the advent of motorways did in the 20th. It would slash journey times between major urban centres and international gateways.  It would free up capacity on the conventional mainline network to enable the continuing shift of freight from roads and onto rail, reducing carbon emissions and cutting congestion.

It would allow the economies of the Midlands and the North to benefit directly from the global magnetic effect of London, tackling the North-South divide in economic growth rates more effectively than half a century of regional policy has done as we expand labour markets and merge the travel to work areas of our major conurbations. West Midlands firms will be able more readily to access the markets and customers in London, while faster links from London to this region will make it more attractive to investors.The proposed Birmingham Interchange Station also would bring huge advantages in terms of connectivity to the wider West Midlands, with links to the motorway network, the airport, Birmingham International Station and the National Exhibition Centre where we meet today. And our commitment to extend the network beyond Birmingham has the potential to bring greater benefits still.  By connecting the West Midlands with Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds, as well as the East Midlands, high speed rail can merge them more and more into a single economic area, with the capability to compete not just with London, but with the other economic centres across Europe.

I submit that, reducing the journey time between two cities to 40 minutes represents not merely a quantitive reduction in travel time, but a qualitative change in the way they interact together.  High speed rail will merge our great population centres into a single economic hinterland.  In short it will provide us with a railway for the 21st century.

**Recent route developments** It was the transformational potential of high speed rail that captured the imagination of David Cameron back in 2008. And since we have been in Government, we have lost no time in pressing ahead with this exciting project. We're continuing to develop and refine our proposals for the route from London to Birmingham, which will cut the journey time to just 49 minutes, even allowing for stops at Old Oak Common and Birmingham Interchange.  Possibly 40 minutes on a non-stop service. And we're working on plans to build a truly national high speed network as set out in the Coalition Agreement.

At the beginning of October, following work by HS2 Ltd, I announced that our preferred option for High Speed Rail north of Birmingham was for two separate corridors. One direct to Manchester, and then connecting onto the West Coast main line, and the other to Leeds via the East Midlands and South Yorkshire - with stations in both areas - before connecting onto the East Coast mainline south of York. This would reduce journey times to Manchester and Leeds to around 80 minutes - only slightly longer than many journeys across the capital. Meanwhile, the trip from Birmingham to Leeds would be almost halved - dropping from around 2 hours today to just an hour and 5 minutes. And we've commissioned and received advice from HS2 Ltd on the options for the link to Heathrow, and for connecting to the wider European high speed network via the HS1 line.

**Addressing the critics** Now, I know that our plans for high speed rail are not universally popular. If I didn't know it before, I found out doing a series of meetings in the communities through which the proposed route will run between London and Birmingham. People are worried about the impact on the countryside. Some say the business case doesn't stack up and that the demand projections are fanciful. And some say that we won't get this through Parliament in a million years. Let me take each of those challenges in turn.

**Environment** I fully understand that the national benefits of high speed rail have to be balanced against the impact on local environments. That's why, in recent months, I have been visiting communities that will be affected by the proposed route. Listening to them. And why I, personally, have been over every mile of the route with HS2 engineers, looking at the stress points; challenging the alignment; exploring different approaches to mitigating the most intrusive local impacts. I am a great lover of our English countryside.  And I do not take the decisions on the HS2 lightly. We will do everything we practically can to mitigate the acoustic and visual impacts of the proposed line and deliver a solution that far exceeds the expectations of those who will be affected by it and who are understandably apprehensive of the impact of HS2. I will personally monitor the mitigation proposals - visual and acoustic - of every mile of this railway. And where we can't hide it, we will make every effort to make it an object of architectural beauty.  Just as Brunel's structures, once resisted as desecrating the countryside, are now accepted as enhancing it. We have launched an Exceptional Hardship scheme for homeowners who need to relocate urgently, and whose property values have been affected by the published route proposal. And we've committed to consulting on a further scheme to help those whose property values are significantly eroded by the construction of a high speed line.

**Business case** Of course, it's not only the route and the environmental impact that have come under scrutiny. There are also many people who have questioned the business case for the project and, indeed, whether a line of this kind is needed at all. Our interurban railways undoubtedly face a major capacity challenge.

Rail journeys within the West Midlands have increased by almost 40 per cent over the last 5 years - with crippling capacity pressures forecast in the coming decades. So the real question is not whether demand will increase, but what are the options for dealing with it. Some people have argued that upgrading the existing West Coast Main Line is the best way to meet demand increases. But I am unconvinced that that is a credible option. First, because reliability would undoubtedly deteriorate through trying to squeeze ever more capacity out of existing, mixed-use, railway lines.  In contrast, a new, dedicated high speed passenger line could improve reliability by creating increasing segregation between different service types. And the released capacity created by HS2 would provide relief for the some of the worst pressures on the local and regional rail network in the West Midlands. More frequent and new services, improved timetabling, and greater resilience.  Attracting more travellers from the roads, relieving congestion and improving journey reliability.

Second, trying to deliver such a massive capacity upgrade on working lines would try the patience of the hardiest of rail passengers. Not to mention the occupiers of the thousands of homes that would need to be demolished. We all remember the last West Coast main line upgrade. [Lew Grade's ""Raising the Titanic"" quip]. And finally, because no upgrade of existing infrastructure can deliver the huge improvements in journey times, and step-change transformation of our economic geography, that a new high speed network would bring.

**Political consensus** And as for getting the Bill through Parliament - well, don't think I underestimate the scale of the challenge. I've heard enough war stories over the years from colleagues who have served on hybrid Bill committees to know just how challenging it is to get them onto the statute book. The key to the success of a project like this, one that will be delivered over many Parliaments, is cross-party consensus. Because this is not a plan for a Parliament. It is a plan for many generations and Parliaments to come. And we can only invest in it if we are clear that it will proceed over four or five Parliaments, whatever the political weather. So I'm grateful for the supportive position adopted so far by Opposition transport spokesmen - and of my predecessor. I will maintain an open and constructive dialogue with them as we move forward with this exciting project. On High Speed Rail, if on nothing else, I believe they will agree that ""we are all in this together.""

**What happens next?** Before I conclude, let me briefly set out what will happen next. We intend to announce the package for consultation, including a preferred route between London and the West Midlands, a corridor preference to Leeds and Manchester, and detailed plans for links to Heathrow and HS1 before Xmas. The consultation we will be launching in the New Year will be as comprehensive, inclusive and wide ranging as possible... an opportunity for everyone to make their views clear. It will cover both the Government's overall high speed rail strategy and the route of the initial London-Birmingham phase of High Speed 2. We will analyse the no doubt numerous responses, and publish our response, setting out our proposed way forward, in December 2011, with the aim of getting the first hybrid Bill for the London-Birmingham route to Royal Assent by the end of this Parliament. But one thing is clear: the opponents of the High Speed Railway are organised, determined and well-financed.  They will make the case against the project - in spades. It is essential that those who see the power of High Speed Rail to deliver the economic change and those who benefit from the transformation it will bring to our economy, speak up and speak out - loudly and clearly - in favour of this project. If they do not, the argument could be lost by default.

**Conclusion** So there is still much that needs to be done. And I do not for one minute underestimate the challenges involved in making high speed rail a reality.

I first looked at this project through the sceptical eyes of a Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. And to those who ask how Britain can afford to invest in a project of this scale, I reply that we cannot afford not to invest in our future. And that if we are to prosper as a nation, every part of that nation has to prosper. It is a project that could transform the social and economic geography of Britain, and transform the role of cities like Birmingham.  By delivering greater mobility and connectivity; slashing journey times; and becoming the mode of choice for intercity travel. The potential to reduce our carbon footprint, shift demand from air to rail and to transform the way we use our existing railway. Above all, the potential to tackle the North-South gap in economic growth rates, a prize that has eluded all modern governments, boosting economic growth across the whole UK, supporting a re-balancing our economy and helping to secure our competitiveness. In short, a vital part of our plan to secure Britain's place in the 21st century global economy.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20101208,Speech to Rail Freight Group Christmas Lunch,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Thanks, in no small part to the RFG and your excellent chairman, there was one thing I learnt very quickly on taking on the transport brief 3 years ago -  that getting it right for passengers isn't enough.Rail freight matters too.

It matters economically, socially and environmentally.

And no Government should under-estimate the importance of getting the balance right between freight and passenger services.

As everyone here will know, the country would quickly grind to a halt without the logistics industry to pump the life blood of modern 'just-in-time' capitalism round the veins and arteries of the nation.

Without the rail freight industry and your competitors in road haulage there'd be no food on our tables and no fuel at our power stations.

Yes, the interest of the travelling public is served by improving passenger rail.

But those same passengers receive crucially important benefits with a transfer of goods from road to rail - benefits like taking lorries off our congested motorways, improving air quality and saving lives on the roads.

The rail freight industry has been one of the real success stories of privatisation with substantial private sector investment.

And I'm pleased too that the MSRS Modal Shift grants have survived the CSR.
I know how valuable they are to the industry in encouraging mode shift from road to rail.

Even when the pressing need to tackle the deficit we've inherited places severe pressure on spending right across Government, we have tried to safeguard programmes which will support our commitments on climate change.

And I firmly believe that helping rail freight compete with road haulage can play a valuable role in our efforts to cut carbon and address congestion.

## Rail freight investment

Acknowledging good deeds by your predecessors is not always a fashionable thing for politicians to do - but  I have always tried to give the last administration real credit for the quality of the work they did on the Strategic Freight Network.

They engaged well with industry to identify the improvements that can do most to improve the climate for rail freight and open up more opportunities for to grow the sector.

And during the long weeks of negotiations on the CSR I'm certain I bored my colleagues to death by going on and on about the importance of the Felixstowe-Nuneaton and Southampton to the West Coast Mainline upgrade programmes.
It was a huge relief when the Chancellor confirmed that these vital projects would continue.

The reality is that George Osborne decided to place a priority on transport capital spending in the CSR because the Coalition accepts that transport infrastructure projects can be some of the best value investments that the taxpayer can make - providing economic benefits many times their cost.

So rail has emerged from the Spending Review in a far stronger position than most people expected, far stronger than I expected.

We all know that the recurrent pattern of spending squeezes in years past was to cancel capital projects, with rail and roads often the first to suffer.

Well that hasn't happened this time round.
In Opposition, we promised to focus on the long term national interest not short term politics.

## Reform

As important as they are, building a successful future for our railways isn't only about big infrastructure projects.

It is also about delivering effective reform.

Reform is essential if we're to deliver a financially sustainable future for the railways.

The interim report published this week by Sir Roy McNulty confirms that railways in the UK are more costly to build, less efficient to maintain and more expensive to use than many of their continental counterparts.

If we are to deliver the capacity upgrades and service improvements that rail users want then costs simply have to come down.

And let me make it very clear - an essential component of a successful reform is delivering an infrastructure provider that's responsive to its customers, both freight and passenger operators.

The Mcnulty study indicates that better alignment of incentives between train operators and Network Rail could deliver significant savings.

I fully agree that getting those responsible for managing track and train working more closely together  - and ensuring they have a shared interest in reducing costs -  could form an important part of a successful reform.

But let me make it clear as I conclude my remarks today, in taking forward work to align of incentives in the rail industry in the way the McNulty report recommends, we will have full regard to the interests of the freight sector.

The RFG will see to that!

Tony Berkeley is my rail freight conscience!

In his statement to Parliament responding to the interim study, the Secretary of State explicitly stated that the changes we are proposing must protect the interests of freight users.

We want to build on Sir Roy's study - to deliver better value for money for passengers, for taxpayers and for freight operators and their customers.

And I look forward to working with your industry to take forward that shared goal.

So, without further ado, it simply remains for me to thank you for listening to my speech today and to wish you all a very Merry Christmas.

And, if precedent is anything to go by, this lunch will provide an extremely merry start to the festive season!

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/penning-20101209,Speech at the Institute of Advanced Motorists Annual Lunch,"Speech by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","It is a privilege to be here today to talk to experts who are so passionate about improving road safety.

I was in St Petersburg recently, and had the honour of saying how well the UK has done on road safety, but there is still more to do.

I've been a fireman and seen carnage on the roads. I've also been a biker and held an HGV licence, so it is a real honour to be road safety Minister.

We're approaching Christmas now, and there will be carnage caused by drink and drugs at this time of year. I am passionate about solving those problems. There are those who will never listen - but I want to send a message that we will catch you, you will lose your licence, be fined up to £5000 and become a pariah.

We need to target the younger audience of 17 - 25 year olds who were not around during the first wave of anti-drink driving campaigns. They need to know that if they are over the limit, they will go to the cells, they will lose their licences and possibly their jobs.

We have to get the message through.

With regard to drugs, it is a real problem in our community - people do drug drive.

I've been at the roadside cutting people out of cars who have been on drugs.

We don't have the technology to be able to arrest people for drug driving at the roadside at the moment. But by 2012 we will have roadside drug testing.

We also need to look at driver education. I've already announced changes to the driving test. I want people to have freedom and to enjoy driving, but safely. My daughters, for example, were taught to pass a test, rather than to be good drivers. I will work with people like you at the IAM to improve advanced driver training, such as motorway driving lessons.

I am a passionate biker, but it's very dangerous. There was a 4% increase in motorcyclists killed or seriously injured last year.

I am carrying out a review of the motorcycle test - it's not fit for purpose as it is. People should not be riding for 2 hours to take a test off road, fail that test and then be allowed to ride 2 hours home again. I want as much of the test as possible to be conducted on the road.

I want all motoring tests (car, motorcycle, MOT) to be fit for purpose.

We need to look at safety measures. The fact that money for speed cameras is no longer ringfenced does not mean that cameras are not useful - in the right circumstances they can really work, but they are not the only option. We need to make sure that we have the most effective, appropriate technology for each individual location - this could be something as simple as white lines, for example on rural roads, white lines being painted on the outside edges was proven to increase safety. A simple, but cheap, measure.

Sadly I have to leave to return to Parliament, but it really is a privilege to be road safety Minister, and you can be assured that this Government is passionate about road safety.

Thank you.

I'm delighted to be here today to set out some of the Government ideas on airports and aviation.

Events such as this one are always a useful reminder of the unique contribution the aviation industry makes to our economy and to our daily lives.

Our airports, airlines and associated industries generate billions of pounds worth of economic output for the UK.

They are a catalyst for growth, creating and supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Aviation has broadened our horizons and shrunk our world... bringing people, communities and countries closer together than ever before.

### Testing times

And it is beyond any question that aviation has been through testing times over recent years.

Grappling with fluctuating oil prices and the global recession is one thing ...

... but I suspect few in the industry could have predicted that an Icelandic volcano would add to their woes as Eyja-fyalla-yokull blasted ash into the atmosphere across Europe last April.

Add to that the long running and intense debate on the local and global environmental impacts of aviation... and it's clear that the industry faces a formidable set of challenges.

I am certain no one here would dispute the fact that international travel provides a hugely positive contribution to the quality of life of millions of families in the UK.

But nor can there be any doubt that the local environmental impact of aviation... such as noise... can have a corrosive impact on quality of life for those under the flightpath.

The task we face today is to find a way to enable the aviation industry to deliver the benefits we want in a sustainable way... with reduced environmental impacts.

With our decision to reject new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stanted... we need to start a new chapter in the history of aviation...

... one that promotes a competitive industry... supporting UK economic growth... while recognising the need for restraint.

We need to find a way to create the right conditions for aviation to flourish within a capacity constrained environment.

Key to achieving that is making the best use of the capacity we have and improving the quality of the passenger experience at UK airports.

### Environmental impact

On the environmental side... I'm pleased to say that real advances are being made.

Airports, airlines, air traffic managers and manufacturers are working together to develop new ways to mitigate the environmental impact of aviation.

New aircraft are getting steadily quieter... and more fuel-efficient.

Progress is being made on improving operating practices to reduce fuel consumption.

And research on sustainable biofuels is producing some striking results.

But the scale and urgency of action required means that multilateral measures like ETS also have a pivotal part to play.

APD reform can also help...

... and let me make it clear that our goal on APD is to deliver the change we need without imposing excessive and disproportionate burdens on the industry or their customers.

But the Coalition will continue to press for the global action and global solutions we need to successfully address aviation's climate change impacts.

### Three stages

Today I'd like to outline some of the key projects we are undertaking to deliver the new chapter in aviation policy we've promised.

I'll take three core stages in turn... early priorities for the next few months... then medium and longer term initiatives.

###
Early priorities - SEAT

To help us deliver early progress on some key aviation issues... we have established the South East Airports Taskforce.

Its remit covers measures to improve the passenger experience at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
But I'd like to emphasise that while the Taskforce is focused on the big airports in the south east... the Government fully recognises the vital importance of regional airports right across the country.

They can be vital economic drivers for the regions they serve... providing crucial connectivity and helping to support local businesses.

A key part of our approach to aviation is to seek to create the right conditions for regional airports to flourish.

We believe that they have a valuable part to play in delivering the Coalition's commitment to rebalancing our economy and reduce the prosperity gap between north and south.

They also have the potential to help relieve overcrowding at south east airports.

Turning back to the Taskforce... I'd like to consider three of its key workstreams:

... resilience and delays,

... border controls

... and security.

### Resilience and delays

Clearly the decision we have made to reject new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted makes it more important than ever that we use the capacity we have in an efficient way.

So I have asked the Civil Aviation Authority to work with Taskforce members to explore what further measures might be taken to improve the overall performance of these airports within their existing capacity limits.

Aspects of this work cover... for example... performance management issues such as scheduling and movement of aircraft on the ground.

The group is also looking at ways to use terminal capacity more efficiently to help improve flows through the airport.

### Border controls

Another recurrent topic in the Taskforce is border control.

Industry representatives continue to express their concerns about long queues for people arriving in the UK.

I gather that these concerns were highlighted once again by Baroness Valentine in her speech earlier today.

Well let me make it clear that I understand these concerns and I believe it is very important that improvements are made.

Securing our borders is vital if we are to combat illegal immigration and turn away criminals seeking to come to Britain.

But we also recognise the importance of providing an efficient system for processing passengers.

Nor do we under-estimate the impact first impressions can have on visitors arriving in the UK.

So the Department is working with the Home Office and the Borders and Immigration Agency to find workable solutions here.

Technological advance provides real cause for optimism here.

For example, electronic gates that will accept the new generation of chipped passports have real potential to improve performance.

And the advance provision of electronic passenger information could allow whole flights to be cleared with only limited checks needed on arrival.

### Security

A third key issue for the Taskforce is security... working alongside the invaluable input from the Department's wider industry group the National Aviation Security Committee.

Now there are certainly a few political challenges to be negotiated in this context.

The tension faced by policy-makers is neatly illustrated by two quotes from the Sun newspaper from just a few weeks ago.

On 28th October... in the wake of Martin Broughton's comments on security checks, the paper's editorial said:

""many will agree with BA chairman Martin Broughton, who says our airport security checks have got out of hand.""

That was followed just three days later... after the cargo bomb plot was uncovered, the Sun said:

""Stay strong:  ""this is not the time for police to heed the calls of disgruntled airline bosses or holiday-makers by relaxing airport checks.""

There's no doubt that the recent cargo bomb plot provided yet another illustration of the ever-present threat posed by terrorists and the continuing Al Quaeda focus on aviation.

And I'd like to pay tribute to the people in our police and security services, in Transec and in industry who work tirelessly every day to keep flying safe and secure.

And let me make it clear... security of passengers will always be paramount.

We will not compromise the high standards of security that are currently delivered.

However, the Coalition recognises that the aviation industry has been arguing for some time that the regulatory framework for aviation security needs reform.

We agree that changing the way aviation security is delivered could yield greater efficiency without compromising passenger security.

We inherited a system from the previous Government that mandates highly detailed processes for delivering aviation security standards.

We are working on a fresh approach...

... one where the Government concentrates on setting rigorous security outcomes to be achieved...

... but gives industry much more flexibility to devise the processes which will deliver those outcomes in the most efficient and passenger-friendly way.

In the safety field the aviation industry has achieved outstanding results in developing safe systems and inculcating a highly effective safety culture.

We believe we can draw on that experience in improving aviation security.

I believe a move to outcome-focused... risk-based regulation will enable the industry, not just to maintain current high standards in security, but to improve them still further.

And I believe the new approach will enable these results to be delivered more efficiently with benefits for airlines, airports and passengers.

We propose to consult formally on reform proposals early in the New Year.

### Consumer protection

The remaining issue I'd like to look at as part of our programme of work on early priorities is reforming consumer protection.

Protecting consumer interests is an important goal in itself... but it's also the case that measures which enhance consumer confidence in international travel can have a positive impact on the aviation industry.

The Government believes that the ATOL scheme which is supposed to protect passengers if their tour operator or travel agent goes bust must be modernised.

Our aims are threefold:

... to adapt the scheme to catch up with the realities of today's complex holiday market.

... to provide much greater clarity to consumers on when they are protected...

... and to secure the financial sustainability of the fund.

In particular... we recognise the urgent need to address the loophole in the scheme revealed by the Travel Republic.

The result of this legal judgement is that products which look almost exactly like package holidays can be sold in such a way as to fall outside the ATOL scheme.

This leaves holiday-makers unprotected and the financial sustainability of the fund under threat.

We expect to be making an announcement early next year on how we propose to address this issue.

Turning to another aspect of consumer protection... I recognise that EC261 is now operating in a way that was simply not foreseen when the legislation was adopted.

In particular, the Sturgeon judgment that equates a 3 hour delay with a cancellation and consequently mandates high pay-outs is difficult to reconcile with holding a fair balance between industry and customer.

My colleague, the Secretary of State, raised this at his very first attendance at the Council of Ministers...

... and the Department is continuing to work with the Commission on a way forward on this.

That said... the slow pace of legislative change in the EU means that this issue is one that blends into the next section of my speech... namely medium term projects.

But there can be no doubt that change is needed.

### Medium term

Our medium term priorities include progress on the Single European Sky project which has significant potential to cut down on delays, improve resilience and see our airports working better.

But the centre-piece of our medium term work is modernisation of the framework for economic regulation of airports.

We signalled our intention to legislation in this area in the Queen's speech.

The current airport economic regulation model was established back in the 1980s.

Both the industry and the CAA agree it is out-dated and in need of reform.

So we want to replace the existing framework for setting price caps at regulated airports with a more flexible system.

Rather than focusing the bulk of regulatory action on a single price review every few years... we want to give the CAA the powers it needs to become a more responsive regulator throughout the regulatory control period.

Whether it's security queues, passenger facilities, or aircraft stands...

... the licence based system we propose should to enable to regulator to become much more activist in intervening where an airport is failing its customers.

New enforcement powers including financial penalties should enable the CAA to tackle poor performance more effectively.

As well as encouraging improvements to the way airports operate... we believe the new regime should incentivise investment in the right kind of new facilities...

... such as better baggage handling equipment and terminal improvements that are in tune with what passengers want.

A key part of our reform package involves giving the CAA a new primary duty to promote the interests of passengers.

But let me emphasise that this does not mean that the voice of airlines will go unheard or disregarded by the regulator.

I fully recognise the importance of ensuring that the reformed system is responsive to the concerns of airlines as the direct users of airports.

It's crystal clear to me that protecting the passenger interest will often be best served by listening to the airlines whose business it is to give their customers what they want.

I know the airline community is concerned about the decision to focus the new regulatory system on passengers... ie the end-user of airports...

... but this is consistent with the regime in operation in other regulatory contexts...

... and I really don't think it is unreasonable to ask the regulator to give priority to passenger interests in the limited range of cases where the interests of airlines and their customers are not aligned.

And we have listened to industry concerns on Labour's proposal to give a role to Passenger Focus.

Instead we are working with the CAA to build on the work of the long-standing Air Transport Users Council... to create enhanced advocacy for passengers alongside a stronger consumer focus within CAA.

### Longer Term/Conclusion

In my concluding remarks this afternoon, I'd like to outline our longer term plans for delivering a successful and sustainable aviation industry.

Next Spring, the DfT will issue a scoping document setting out the key issues we are seeking to address in our overall strategy for aviation...

... a strategy to support economic growth, protect Heathrow's status as a highly successful global hub and addresses aviation's environmental impacts.

We will then open up a dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders to seek their views and to draw on their knowledge and experience.

Our intention is to publish a draft policy document for formal consultation early in 2012 - with a view to adopting our new aviation strategy in 2013.
Across the board on aviation - the Coalition is already engaging on multiple levels and in many different ways with a range of stakeholders - including the airports, aviation and aerospace industries.

As we move forward in developing our more detailed strategy - your input will be invaluable - alongside that of a host of interested parties who care passionately about the decisions we will be making -

- like community groups, environmentalists, local authorities, business organisations and passengers.

We want this to be a very open and inclusive process.

Input from all of these diverse interests and perspectives will be hugely beneficial in helping us get the right answers on aviation -

- answers which improve connectivity, generate prosperity and continue to provide millions of people with the benefits that travel abroad can bring -

- but do so in a way which does not impose an unacceptable cost in terms of our environment or our quality of life.
I do not under-estimate how difficult this task will be but it is vital that we achieve it.

And let's remember that it's barely a hundred or so years since the Wright brothers first risked life and limb by taking to the skies in box shaped bi-planes made of spruce and kept aloft with 12 horse power engines.

During that period - Britain's world beating aviation and aerospace industries have solved many seemingly intractable problems.

I have every confidence that by working together - we can do so again.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20110126,Speech to Transport Times Aviation conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Thank you for that introduction Rob.

It's a pleasure to join you today for this important Transport Times Conference to discuss elements of the Government's approach to aviation. Two of the Coalition's highest priorities are to tackle the debt crisis and support growth. So it is important that we have a policy framework that allows the aviation industry to flourish in a competitive global environment.

Britain's civil aviation industry has a long and distinguished history of innovation. From the pioneering early years of the 20th century throughout its history, Britain's aviation industry has adapted successfully to meet many different challenges. The statistics are well known but it's well worth repeating some of them. Our aviation industry generates about  £11 billion a year, and employs around 200,000 people. By conquering distance and bringing communities and businesses across the world closer together aviation supports hundreds of thousands of jobs elsewhere in the economy. And of course the industry stretches well beyond the passenger market to cover:

  * the air freight sector
  * the aerospace and engineering specialists involved in aircraft assembly and maintenance
  * the legal, finance and insurance companies who support aviation related transactions

and, of course, General Aviation, which probably accounts for around 8% of the whole commercial aviation sector's economic contribution.

But aviation's success must not come at the cost of our environmental obligations. The task we face is to enable the industry to operate in a sustainable way, one that is consistent with meeting our climate change commitments, as well as reducing the impact of flying on local communities by addressing issues such as air quality and noise.

We rejected proposals for new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted because they would have caused an unacceptable level of environmental damage particularly in relation to noise. Aviation must play its part in helping to deliver a low carbon transport system while contributing to sustainable economic growth. I am confident the industry can rise to the challenge.

## South East Airport Taskforce

In the light of the decision to reject new runways at the south east's three biggest airports, it has become more important than ever to ensure that we make the best use of the capacity we have. We need to improve our airports and improve the quality of the passenger experience within those capacity constraints. To assist us in delivering those goals we established the South East Airports Taskforce.

The remit of the Taskforce focuses on improving the passenger experience at Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted but I hope that its work will also help other airports address issues affecting passengers. Regional airports right across the country make a vital contribution to local economies. A key part of our approach to aviation is to seek to create the right conditions for regional airports to flourish. I believe that they also have the potential to help relieve overcrowding in the south east. So it is important that the work of the South East Airports Taskforce benefits the wider industry.

Three of the issues under consideration are:

  * border queues
  * security
  * and resilience.

Taking those in turn we are working with the Home Office and the UK Border Agency on ideas for improving the way border checks for passengers are handled. Securing our border against crime, terror and illegal immigration is vital. The impressive work being done by UKBA particularly with new technology is focused on delivering this crucial policy goal in a way which minimises inconvenience for passengers.

## Security

There is also some encouraging news on security. Although the tragic events in Moscow this week were an attack on the landside of the airport illustrate the threat to aviation as whole is one against which we need continuing vigilance. The UK's aviation security regime has performed well over the past thirty years or so and continues to do so. Nevertheless, we are analysing ways in which the regulatory framework for aviation security might be reformed with the aim of providing greater efficiency while maintaining the same high levels of passenger security or better.

The aviation industry told us that the system we inherited from the last Government can sometimes be too prescriptive and process-driven in its requirements. So we are working on a fresh approach that will set the industry very demanding outcomes to achieve but gives them more flexibility to work out the best and most efficient processes by which to deliver those outcomes. I believe this will enable airports to further improve security and deliver them in a more passenger-friendly and efficient way. I am confident that such an approach can enhance our ability to deliver our security goals as well as benefiting airlines, airports, staff and passengers. We propose to consult formally on reform proposals soon.

## Resilience and capacity management

Turning to a third key element of the work of the Taskforce we have established a sub-group on resilience and delays which is looking at ways to make better use of existing capacity both inside and outside the terminal. This could involve improving the flow of passengers through the airport or changing the scheduling and movement of aircraft on the ground. We're hoping to find collaborative solutions which see airlines and airports working more cohesively together to improve the overall journey for passengers through the airport.

We're considering the overall approach taken to capacity management. In any transport system there is a trade off between capacity and resilience. For years, the question at Heathrow was always how many more flights can be squeezed in? Arguably, insufficient regard was paid to the impact on resilience of continuing to fill up the airport ever closer to its physical capacity limits. I believe that needs to change this approach We need to tilt the balance the other way and place a much stronger focus on resilience to see if better working practices give the airport more breathing space to recover when things go wrong. Following December's severe weather the Resilience sub-group is also considering measures to improve winter preparations in parallel with the work of David Begg's review of the problems which occurred at Heathrow which I'm sure will reach some important conclusions.

I'll deal slightly later in my speech with the Bill we are preparing on reform of airport regulation, but one element of that proposed reform is the introduction of a licensing system. This would give the CAA much more effective powers to check that regulated airports are preparing properly for severe weather. We'll also consider whether we can learn from other areas such as the railways where emergency timetables can be introduced if extreme weather conditions look set to significantly reduce operating capacity. There can't be an exact read-across but other transport systems may provide a source of ideas to try to address the problem of thousands of people turning up for flights which won't be able to take off.

## Single European Sky

Another way to tackle delays and strengthen resilience is via the Single European Sky programme. It's well known that I have a number of serious reservations about the way the EU operates. However air traffic control is an area where I am convinced that closer cooperation with our European partners would yield very significant advantages. I believe that progress on Single European Sky has real potential to reduce delays, enhance resilience, and get our airports working more efficiently.

The SES programme has the potential to cut delays and benefit safety, cost efficiency, and environmental performance. Imposing performance obligations on navigation service providers across all Member States should provide some important benefits. The UK National Performance Plan is being prepared by the CAA and will be made available for consultation during March and April. Both the UK and Irish national plans will contain a section which identifies the contribution made by our joint Functional Airspace Block or ""FAB"". Our FAB is the first to be operational in Europe. It's already yielding real improvements in fuel consumption and emission reductions.

In the future, I hope that the Single European Sky programme will also deliver a system which is far more resilient in the face of the industrial militancy that is a recurrent feature of air traffic control in some of our European neighbours and which can blight the holiday plans of so many travellers.

## Airport regulation

Closer to home updating the framework for the economic regulation of airports provides another way in which we can improve the quality of service that airlines and passengers receive. The current model was established back in the 1980s, and both the industry and the CAA agree it is outdated. We want to replace the existing framework for setting price caps at regulated airports with a more flexible system. Rather than focusing the bulk of regulatory action on a single price review every five years  we propose to give the CAA the powers it needs to become a more responsive regulator throughout the control period. Whether it's security queues, passenger facilities, or aircraft stands the licence based system we propose should enhance the effectiveness of the regulator by enabling it to intervene more quickly if an airport is failing its customers. And new enforcement powers, including financial penalties, should enable the CAA to tackle poor performance more effectively.

I believe the reforms will encourage investment in the right kind of new facilities such as better baggage handling equipment and terminal improvements that are in tune with what passengers want. Giving the CAA a primary duty to promote the interests of passenger is also an important part of the regime. But let me emphasise that this does not mean that the voice of airlines will go unheard or disregarded by the regulator. We fully recognise the importance of ensuring that the reformed system is responsive to the concerns of airlines as the direct users of airports. It's very clear to me that protecting the passenger interest will often be best served by listening to the airlines whose business it is to give their customers what they want in a competitive market. I know the airline community is concerned about the decision to focus the primary duty of the new regulatory system on passengers but this is consistent with the approach in many other regulatory contexts and in the limited range of cases where the interests of airlines and their customers are not aligned it is right for the regulator to give priority to passenger concerns.

And we _have_ listened to the airlines on Labour's proposal to give a role to Passenger Focus in this context. Instead we are working with the CAA to build on the work of the long-standing Air Transport Users Council to create enhanced advocacy for passengers alongside a stronger consumer focus within CAA. As a substitute for the heavy handed approach of the previous Government.

## Consumer protection

Consumer protection is another key area of policy that needs to be addressed. For example, the Government believes that the ATOL scheme which is supposed to protect passengers if their tour operator or travel agent goes bust needs modernising. I'm concerned that many consumers do not have a clear understanding of when they are covered and when they are not. The Courts' interpretation of a 'package holiday' in the recent Travel Republic case has compounded this problem. Following the travel company failures in the summer we also need to consider how best to stabilise and secure the long term financial sustainability of the fund. As a starting point in October, the Civil Aviation Authority announced that it would be introducing a new certificate for each ATOL protected holiday making it easier for consumers to establish whether they are covered or not. Work is now underway to analyse what other measures are needed to make ATOL more relevant to the realities of the modern holiday market. I should also make it clear that the Government recognises that EC261 on Denied Boarding is now operating in a way that was not foreseen when the legislation was adopted. So the Department will work with the European Commission to find a more balanced solution.

## Conclusion

Ladies and gentlemen I've tried this morning to give you further insight into the Coalition's vision for aviation setting out some of our ideas for meeting the core economic, environmental and customer service challenges facing the sector. In the months ahead, we will be expanding on that vision.

March will see my colleagues at the Treasury publish their conclusions on Air Passenger Duty. I can assure you that the DfT has contributed to Treasury work on this with analysis on the impact of aviation taxation. We've also ensured the views of different industry players have been fed into the decision-making process. I know some of you may want to press me on APD but you will appreciate that it is simply not possible for me to anticipate the Budget announcement. In the same month, the DfT will publish a scoping document posing strategic questions on the way forward for aviation. A draft policy framework will be published for consultation during 2012. I would encourage you all to take part in the consultation to help us write a new chapter for aviation policy in Britain. Aviation has often been a divisive subject in recent years. The Coalition wants to try to build a wider consensus through a more open and inclusive dialogue and better mutual understanding than the last Government achieved. That won't be an easy task but with your help, I believe we can achieve it.

Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen it's a pleasure to be here today. The aviation sector will always enjoy strong support in Parliament. I'm very much aware of APAG's wealth of knowledge and expertise in this field - not least because of the qualified pilots you number amongst your membership. Over the past 16 years, this group has played an important role championing British aviation and holding successive Governments to account on issues affecting the sector. And you continue to make an important contribution today, as the Coalition develops a new policy framework to deliver a sustainable and successful future for aviation.

Two of the Coalition's highest priorities are to tackle the debt crisis and supporting growth. So it is important that we have a policy framework that allows the aviation industry to flourish in a highly competitive global market. Britain's civil aviation industry has a long and distinguished history of innovation. From the pioneering early years of the 20th century - throughout its history - Britain's aviation industry has adapted successfully to meet a host of different and difficult challenges. The statistics are well known but it's worth repeating some of them. Our aviation industry generates about £11 billion a year, and employs around 200,000 people. By conquering distance and bringing communities across the world closer together, aviation supports hundreds of thousands of jobs elsewhere in the economy.

And of course the industry stretches well beyond the passenger market to cover:

  * the air freight sector
  * the aerospace and the engineering specialists involved in aircraft assembly and maintenance
  * the legal, finance and insurance companies who support aviation related transactions
  * and, not forgetting General Aviation, which probably accounts for around 8% of the commercial aviation sector's economic contribution.

The task we face is to enable the industry to operate in a sustainable way, one that is consistent with meeting our climate change commitments as well as reducing the impact of flying on local communities by addressing issues such as air quality and noise impacts on local communities. We rejected proposals for new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted because they would have caused an unacceptable level of environmental damage - particularly in relation to noise. Aviation needs to play its part in helping to deliver a low carbon transport system while contributing to sustainable economic growth.

### Technological advance

British engine and wing technology is already playing a major role in progress towards achieving this goal.  We can be proud of the fact that new aircraft like the Airbus A350 will contain so much British engineering excellence, including British wings and British engines. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner also contains lots of British engineering, including the popular Rolls Trent engines. We can be proud that UK manufacturing can still provide world beating technology. Together these new aircraft will increase efficiency for passengers, reduce emissions around airports and help address noise problems. Over the horizon I hope we can look forward to real advances on biofuels and new engine technology such as the Advanced Open Rotor which Rolls have championed for some years.

### South East Airport Taskforce

But the decision to reject new runways at the south east's three biggest airports makes it more important than ever to ensure that we make the best use of the capacity we have. We need to improve our airports and we need to improve the quality of the passenger experience within the capacity constraints we face. To assist us in delivering those goals we established the South East Airports Taskforce. The remit of the Taskforce focuses on improving the passenger experience at Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted, but I am confident that its work will also help other airports address issues affecting passengers. Regional airports right across the country make a vital contribution to local economies. A key part of our approach to aviation is to seek to create the right conditions for regional airports to flourish. So it is important that the work of the Taskforce benefits the wider industry.

Three of the issues under consideration are:

  * border queues
  * security
  * and resilience

Taking those in turn, we are working with the Home Office and the UK Border Agency on ideas for improving the way border checks for passengers are handled. Securing our border against crime, terror and illegal immigration is vital in the dangerous times we live in. The impressive work being done by UKBA, particularly with new technology, is focused on delivering this crucial policy goal in a way which minimises inconvenience for passengers.

### Security

There is also some encouraging news on security. Although the tragic events in Moscow recently were aimed at the landside of the airport, the threat to aviation as a whole is one against which we need continuing vigilance. The UK's aviation security regime has performed well over the past thirty years or so and continues to do so. Nevertheless, we are analysing ways in which the regulatory framework for aviation security could be reformed with the aim of providing greater efficiency, while maintaining the same high levels of passenger security or better.

The aviation industry told us that system we inherited from the last Government can sometimes be too prescriptive and process-driven in its requirements. So we are working on a fresh approach that will set the industry very demanding outcomes to achieve, but gives them more flexibility to work out the best and most efficient processes by which to deliver those outcomes. I believe this will enable airports to further improve security and do so in a more passenger-friendly and efficient way. I am confident that such an approach can enhance our ability to deliver our security goals as well as benefiting airlines, airports, staff and passengers. We propose to consult soon on our reform proposals.

### Resilience and capacity management

Turning to a third key element of the work of the Taskforce we have established a sub-group on resilience and delays which is looking at ways to make better use of existing capacity both inside and outside the terminal. This could involve improving the flow of passengers through the airport or changing the scheduling and movement of aircraft on the ground. We're hoping to find collaborative solutions which see airlines and airports in working more cohesively together to improve the overall journey through the airport. We're considering the overall approach taken to capacity management. In any transport system there is a trade off between capacity and resilience. For years, the question at Heathrow was always how many more flights can be squeezed in? Arguably, insufficient regard was paid to the impact on resilience of continuing to fill up the airport ever closer to its physical capacity limits. I believe that needs to change. We need to tilt the balance the other way and place a much stronger focus on resilience to see if better working practices give the airport more breathing space to recover when things go wrong. Following December's severe weather the Resilience sub-group is also considering measures to improve winter preparations. The licensing system we propose to introduce could give the CAA much more effective power to check that regulated airports are preparing properly for severe weather.

### Airport regulation

But there are a number of ways in which we expect our reforms of airport regulation to improve the quality of service that airlines and passengers receive. We want to replace the existing framework for setting price caps at regulated airports with a more flexible system. Rather than focusing the bulk of regulatory action on a single price review every five years we propose to give the CAA the powers it needs to become a more responsive regulator _throughout_ the control period. Whether it's security queues, passenger facilities, or aircraft stands the licence based system we propose should enhance the effectiveness of the regulator by enabling it to intervene more quickly if an airport is failing its customers. And new enforcement powers, including financial penalties, should enable the CAA to tackle poor performance more effectively. An important part of the regime is giving the CAA a primary duty to promote the interests of passengers. But let me emphasise that this does not mean that the voice of airlines will go unheard or disregarded by the regulator. I fully recognise the importance of ensuring that the reformed system is responsive to the concerns of airlines as the direct users of airports. It's very clear to me that protecting the passenger interest will often be best served by listening to the airlines whose business it is to give their customers what they want in a highly competitive market. I know the airline community is concerned about the decision to focus the new regulatory system on end users - passengers - but this is consistent with the approach in many other regulatory contexts, and in the limited range of cases where the interests of airlines and their customers are not aligned I believe it is right for the regulator to give priority to passenger concerns.

### General Aviation

I was asked today to focus on the Government's overall approach to the aviation sector as a whole. However, no speech to the Air League would be complete without reference to General and Business Aviation. I've already acknowledged the economic significance of GA. But I also fully recognise that GA's contribution to aviation goes beyond the merely economic. It provides thousands of enthusiasts the chance to enjoy their passion for flying, providing world class training for pilots, technicians and many other roles and inspires many youngsters to take up a career in the aviation business. So I fully appreciate the importance of ensuring our policy and regulatory framework for aviation deals with GA in a proportionate way. While some issues and standards will clearly cut across the whole of the aviation sector, there will be other areas where a one-size-fits-all approach would have an unfair and disproportionate impact on General and Business Aviation. So we engaged with Ofcom when their proposals on spectrum pricing looked set to impose a very heavy burden on GA. While the outcome still involves additional charges, they are far more modest than the initial proposals and reflect the fact that GA concerns have been heard and acted on.

After discussions with the Parliamentary Aviators' Group, I wrote formally to my DCLG colleagues emphasising the importance of small airfields. My goal was to make sure the transport benefits of these facilities were properly taken on board in the planning system. I would urge this group and others interested in GA to engage with the Department for Communities as they take forward their plans on reforming the planning system.

This is a useful opportunity for voices to be heard. And I've been hassling my officials on the new EASA rules on pilot qualification. The decision to require US registered pilots to obtain a licence from an EU member state was taken by the previous Government. I'm afraid this was a fait accompli before I arrived as Aviation Minister. But I want to assure you that we're doing what we can to minimise any unnecessary bureaucracy and to give pilots sufficient time to comply with the new rules. And lastly on GA matters, I should mention that I will shortly be writing to Siim Kallas who covers transport for the European Commission about the importance of GA. The Commission's 2007 communication on General and Business Aviation contained much that was welcomed by the GA community. The response of the European Parliament was also positive. The point I want to make to Commissioner Kallas is that we've yet to see the good intentions laid out in those documents manifest themselves in practical application. In particular, the EU institutions should take more seriously the need to properly assess the differential impact that new regulations can have on General Aviation and to ensure that a proportionate approach is adopted reflecting the specific characteristics of the sector. To persuade the Commission that a one-size-fits-all approach across the sector is not always the best one.

###  Conclusion

Ladies and gentlemen, I've tried this morning to give you further insight into the Coalition's vision for aviation, setting out some of our ideas for meeting the core economic, environmental and customer service challenges facing the aviation sector. In the months ahead, we will be expanding on that vision. March will see my colleagues at the Treasury publish their conclusions on Air Passenger Duty. I can assure you that the DfT has contributed to Treasury work on this with analysis on the impact of aviation taxation. We've also tried to ensured the views of different industry players have been fed into the decision-making process. In the same month, the DfT will publish a scoping document posing strategic questions on the way forward for aviation. A draft policy framework will be published for consultation during 2012. I look forward to working with the Parliamentary Aerospace group to help us write a new chapter for aviation policy in Britain. Aviation has often been a divisive subject in recent years, all too often portrayed as a battle between two polarised extremes. The Coalition wants to try to build a wider consensus through a more open and inclusive dialogue and better mutual understanding than the last Government achieved. That won't be an easy task, but with your help, I believe we can achieve it.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/penning-20110201,Listening to Industry workshop,"Speech by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","## Introductory remarks

I'd like to kick off proceedings by giving by warm welcome to one and all.

It's great to see so many of you here today - so thank you for making the time and taking the trouble to come along, it really is appreciated.

This event is all about listening to you - you are the experts, the people who know what works and what doesn't, you're the ones who really understand the big issues facing the sector.

## Freight and logistics organisations matter

Since taking up my job there is something I've come to learn pretty quickly - namely that this country's freight and logistics organisations matter.

The companies and operators you represent generate economic growth and drive job creation, enhance our social well-being and improve our individual quality of life.

In its own right the UK freight and logistics sector employs well over two million people and is worth over £74 billion to the economy.

But the sector's wider social and economic importance lies in the fact that it delivers the goods and raw materials for producers and consumers, importers and exporters.

Indeed, just try to imagine a world without freight and logistics - our shops and supermarkets would have empty shelves, our power stations would struggle to produce energy, construction projects would face severe delays, factories would grind to a halt and access to the global economy would be closed off.

But, as we know, the sector also has significant environmental impacts. Emissions from freight transport account for around 27% of domestic transport greenhouse gas emissions and HGVs contribute to many urban air pollution 'hotspots'.

We need to work together to meet the UK's challenging environmental targets. You know best how to manage your operations and reduce your fuel consumption and emissions; and I thank you for the work many of you in the room are doing on this within your businesses and with the Department - especially in areas such as lower carbon technologies, consolidation centres and freight modal choice. But we need more progress and so I'll return to this challenge later in my speech.

### Investing in transport, investing in recovery

If you're in the freight and logistics sector then, at the core of your job, is a determination to ensure that the right thing arrives in the right place, at the right time.

At the heart of my job is a determination to ensure that we have the transport networks, the policy frameworks and the proportionate regulations that enable you to do what you do best.

But, of course, both of us, industry and government, are working in a new economic landscape - one that's been shaped by the unsustainable levels of debt bequeathed to the Coalition when we came into office.

So this Government's top priority is tackling the inherited fiscal crisis. From our Emergency Budget, to our Spending Review, we have taken the tough decisions needed to cut waste and control spending, repair our public finances and rebalance our national economy.

Among those tough decisions have been ones on VAT and fuel duty - decisions we had to take to deal with the biggest budget deficit in the G8 and one of the worst records on debt anywhere.

But, we understand how painful and difficult price rises at the pump are. That's why the Treasury are looking at a fair fuel stabiliser.  The Chancellor has asked the Office for Budget Responsibility to undertake an assessment of the effect of oil price fluctuations on the public finances. Informed by this assessment, the Government will examine options for the design of a fair fuel stabiliser.

So yes - there have been tough decisions and hard choices. But the rescue mission we have undertaken has won the confidence of the international markets and taken this country out of the danger zone. It is also creating the conditions that will help private businesses to grow, to thrive and to hire more people.

Relative to other areas of Government spending, transport did well out of the recent Spending Review. We recognise that, by investing in transport infrastructure, we are also investing in economic recovery.

A modern, fit for purpose transport system is also crucial for the future success of the freight and logistics sector. So while I have this opportunity I'd like to highlight some of the key projects, programmes and practical steps we are taking to support you and the valuable work that you do.

### Projects, programmes and practical steps

We are investing in major road schemes on key freight corridors - for example, on the M62, M1 and M25. Moreover, the use of managed motorways technology will make all journeys more reliable.

We are also able to support continued investment in the rail freight network to 2014, with £150 million being available from the Transport Innovation Fund for Port of Southampton and Port of Felixstowe gauge clearance; and £200 million for the Strategic Freight Network schemes.

To improve capacity at our ports we have given consent for major container terminal developments at Bathside Bay (Harwich), Felixstowe South, Liverpool, London Gateway (Shellhaven), Teesport and the Port of Bristol.

I'm convinced that our proposals to invest in high speed rail will have a positive impact on the rail freight industry by freeing up much-needed space on our existing railway for freight services - for example, on the WCML to the West Midlands

I'm making sure that targeted HGV enforcement remains a central plank in our overall approach to supporting the haulage industry.

And of course we're introducing an HGV charging scheme to ensure that UK hauliers get a fairer deal - which officials will discuss with you this afternoon

I also believe that our localism agenda provides real opportunities for you as an industry. Under the new Regional Growth Fund, £1.4 billion is available to 2013/14 to provide a mixture of support for private sector investments and basic infrastructure schemes.

I would encourage you all to get involved in the new Local Enterprise Partnerships which we expect to play a role in taking decisions on local strategic transport priorities.

### Cleaner, greener challenge

Earlier I mentioned the sector's environmental impact. Well this Government is determined to back you in your efforts to meet the challenge of making freight and logistics cleaner and greener

One example of that support is our mode shift grant support scheme, designed to assist companies with the operating costs of running rail and water freight services, where rail and water is more expensive than road.
We have a confirmed budget for these grants of £20 million for 2011-12 and £19 million for 2012-13. In addition an indicative budget is in place of £19 million for both 2013-14 and 2014-15.

Another example of support is our work with the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership to promote and speed up the development and adoption of greener vehicle technologies and fuels for road freight movements.

We should also shortly be consulting on increasing the length of semi trailers to 2.05m - and I'm pleased to say that you will get an opportunity today to contribute to development of this consultation.

I welcome the progress being made to shrink the sector's environmental footprint. But as I've already said, emissions from freight must fall further if we are to meet our wider climate change objectives - and especially emissions from road freight if road is to compete with other modes in a future low carbon economy.

And let me be clear on this - the more progress the industry itself makes, the easier it will be to ease the burden of regulation on industry.

I took the decision in October not to make eco-driving training mandatory. Instead I want to encourage and support industry-led schemes to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.

In 2012, I will need to review progress made by industry and re-consider the case for Government intervention. I have written to the Chief Executives of the major freight associations on the Department's Low Carbon Supply Chain group to reinforce the importance I place on this review.

So now is the time for you to put in place measures in your business that will lessen your fuel consumption and environmental impacts - and to tell us about them. Today is an opportunity for you to discuss these measures with officials. And also to discuss how to cope with the challenges that our climate throws at us - the recent inclement weather conditions have highlighted the importance of today's session on supply chain resilience.

### Partnership working

I'm not just encouraged by the steady progress that's being made on meeting the environmental challenges facing the sector - I'm also delighted by the partnership working that underpins it.

I know many of you in the room have worked hard with the Department to develop joint industry-Government recently published guidance on carbon reporting. I see this guidance as a vital first step towards any industry-led action on reducing emissions and I thank you for your help in taking it from drawing board to final document.

I also know some of you are involved with the Freight Transport Association and UK Major Ports group in considering how to take forward industry-led actions to promote greater use of rail and coastal shipping, where they are appropriate and I will be supporting your efforts to do so..

### Conclusions

It just remains me to thank you again for coming along and to say that I look forward to hearing your views both in the Q&A session and also when officials feed back to me the outputs of today's workshops.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/penning-20110207,Chamber of Shipping Annual Dinner,"Speech by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you for that kind introduction Jan. This country's shipping industry is, and always will be, fundamental to our prosperity and our security. I am incredibly proud to be the Maritime Minister, and I want to be here, a constructive friend to the industry.

As we move forward together, I can already see that positive steps are being taken and real progress is being made. We have already made significant steps:

  * On Light Dues, I've recently confirmed a move to full funding of Irish Lights from Irish domestic sources by 2015/16;
  * On Ship to Ship Transfers, I have suspended legislation that would have pushed ships 12.1miles out from our coast.

But there are challenges. On the issue of Equality of Pay, I will have to introduce some legislation following infraction proceedings. These will be the minimum provisions though and I will do all I can to make a level playing field across the EU. Turning to Piracy, a huge challenge and concern for our industry - I know that in reality many UK flagged ships are already employing armed guards to protect themselves. If shipping companies choose to have them, I don't want cowboys on ships - I want properly trained security companies. That is why I am looking at our guidance on this issue to give the industry support and advice if they choose to go down this route.

On the broader economic front, this Government is tackling our inherited debt so as to create the conditions that will help private businesses, just like those you represent, to thrive. Yes, the challenges we face mean we are navigating our way through some choppy economic seas. But cutting the deficit is the best way to spark demand, spur job creation and strengthen our economy, and that's why we must stick to the course we have set out. This need for growth is one of the reasons that I want to look very closely at all the trust ports round the UK to make sure that they have the right commercial ambitions to grow. The other way we will grow is to invest in our young people. That is why we have protected the SMART budget this year and want to work together with you as part of our review to find the most effective way of supporting our young trainees.

When it comes to offshore renewables, I warmly welcome the co-operation being provided by the shipping and ports industries. It is possible to realise the full potential of this new source of clean energy in a way that does **not** compromise the economic viability of our shipping our ports industries, nor compromise navigational safety.

I want to protect our seas as well so that we can have a renaissance in Coastal Shipping. We are an island nation and we need to transport more goods by sea. Working together, I truly believe that we can build that successful and sustainable future. That's what excites me about my job and that's why I am incredibly proud to be your champion in Government. It's also the reason, as I said at the start of my speech, that I am totally committed to partnership working. You have a Minister who is on your side and in your corner. Now, does that mean that we will always agree on every last dot and comma of shipping policy? Of course it doesn't. But I know that we stand on common ground and share a common cause. And that's why I also know that, as well as having a history of which it can be proud, Britain's shipping industry also has a future of which it can be confident. So I thank you for your hospitality, I thank you for listening and I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20110228,High Speed Rail,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","Ladies and gentlemen.

It is a very great pleasure to welcome you here today for the launch of our consultation into high speed rail, and where more appropriate than Birmingham; a city with a proud industrial heritage - now looking firmly to the future - to diversify and grow - as it creates the jobs of tomorrow and plans to reap the benefits of HSR.

This will be one of the most extensive and, potentially, most far reaching government consultations in history. The proposal we are consulting on is not merely a blueprint for a new national railway, speeding passengers in huge numbers between our largest and most important conurbations in state of the art 225 mph trains, but also a vision for the future of inter-city travel in the 21st century. An investment in infrastructure to deliver the long-term growth, jobs and prosperity that Britain needs if we are to retain our place in the world league tables. A once-in-a-generation chance to reshape our economic geography; bring our key cities closer together; regenerate our urban centres; and tackle the North-South divide that has held this country back for far too long.

## Economic Context

It is ten months since the new Coalition Government began tackling the debt crisis that threatened to cripple the UK for a generation, and set about rebuilding our economy after one of the longest and deepest recessions on record. But rooting out waste, reforming welfare and balancing budgets is only part of the solution to the country's economic problems. The next challenge is to secure the growth, the jobs, and the investment that will lay the foundations for a stronger, more balanced, more competitive economy in the long term - while delivering on our climate change obligations. And infrastructure investment - as the Chancellor has clearly spelt out - will be a crucial part of answering that challenge. Over the next few years, despite the squeeze on public spending, we will invest in Crossrail, in Thameslink and in London's tube upgrades. As these projects reach completion, we need to move the focus away from London - to the infrastructure that will support the wider UK economy.

## Origins of HS2/ the problem

When we became the first party to commit to high speed rail in Opposition, we recognised its potential to rebuild and rebalance the UK economy through massive improvements in journey times, in connections between cities, and in capacity. We could see that the country needed a radical and visionary solution, to tackle the road congestion and rail overcrowding that are set to become significant obstacles to economic growth, and to deal with rising demand for inter-city travel in the future. Our railways have undergone a remarkable, and welcome renaissance. Against a baseline assumption at privatisation of continued, managed decline - the opposite has happened. Between 1994 and 2009, the number of miles travelled by rail passengers in Britain soared - from 18 billion to 32 billion - and that growth shows no sign of slowing. Network Rail estimates that demand on the West Coast Main Line route between London and Manchester will grow by around 60% between now and 2024 - yet even today passengers have to stand in peak periods on some long-distance journeys. Ignoring the problem is simply not an option. Severe overcrowding would spread from the peaks, to the whole of the day, and the reliability of the network would deteriorate. More passengers would be forced onto short-haul air services or onto the road network, generating ever-rising levels of carbon.

## HS2 the answer - lessons from abroad

After an extensive review of the options, which is summarised in the document published today, our conclusion is that the only sustainable transport solution to these challenges is high speed rail. No other form of transport investment offers the same package of benefits. Indeed, countries across the developed world have come to the same conclusions - and are pressing ahead with ambitious plans for high speed rail. The UK simply cannot afford to be left behind. Across Europe and Asia, high speed rail has delivered for travellers in terms of journey times, capacity, reliability, comfort and accessibility. And it has delivered for our competitors' economies, the job creation, regeneration and economic benefits that we will see in the UK if we go ahead with HS2. Not to mention modal shift: Flights between Paris and Brussels have all but come to an end and air traffic between Madrid and Barcelona is in dramatic decline since the opening of high speed lines.

## Service benefits

The network we are proposing today would bring central London to within 49 minutes of Birmingham; to within 73 minutes of Manchester and 80 minutes of Leeds. At least 14 services an hour in each direction would be added on the North-South route - each carrying more than 1,000 passengers. Transferring long distance services to the high speed line would release capacity on the existing East Coast, West Coast and Midland main lines, allowing substantially improved commuter services and new opportunities for freight. For the first time, high speed rail would deliver fast and efficient links between cities in the North and the Midlands - overcoming the inherent connectivity deficiencies of the current railway and its Victorian design. _The current rail journey from Birmingham to Leeds, for example, takes 2 hours. HS2 would cut that to 1 hour 5 minutes._

## Economic benefits

By connecting the West Midlands with Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds, as well as the East Midlands, high speed rail would allow them increasingly to operate as a single economic area, with the capability to compete with other economic centres across Europe. The links from HS2 onto both the West Coast and East Coast mainlines would enable high speed services to reach other destinations - including Newcastle, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh - by through running onto the existing network. High speed rail would allow the economies of the North and the Midlands to benefit more directly from the economic strength of London and the South East:  improving urban productivity, providing access to major new markets and enabling them more easily to attract the most highly skilled workers. The network would generate economic benefits of around £44 billion - and the first phase alone would support the creation of more than 40,000 jobs. HS2 will be good for business and good for jobs. Which is why 69 business leaders wrote to the Financial Times last week in support of our proposals for high speed rail.

## Work so far/ mitigation

A huge amount of work and preparation has gone into developing the project - and getting to the launch of this consultation. And I would like to thank the teams in HS2 and DfT for all their hard work. More than 90 options were considered for stations and line of route sections during the process. By dividing the line up into sections, HS2 ltd developed a shortlist of seven different possible routes, which was then narrowed down to three - and then finally one.

I came to this project for the first time in May. And I have asked the difficult questions; challenged the departmental conventional wisdom. I've explored the objectors' arguments and put my officials on the spot to rebut them to me. I am satisfied that what we are publishing today is a robust proposal, in which the national benefits of high speed rail will have been properly balanced against the impact on local communities. I have personally reviewed every mile of the route with HS2 engineers, looking at the stress points; challenging the alignment; exploring different approaches to mitigating the most intrusive local impacts. I have visited the whole of the line of route and the communities that will be affected by it, listening to their views.

This painstaking process has already had a massive impact in shaping the proposal that we are launching in today's consultation. Over half the route has been refined since the original recommendations of HS2 were delivered in December 2009 - for example adding more than a mile and a half of 'green tunnels' to maintain local access and minimise noise and visual impacts. We have lowered the vertical alignment of large sections of the line, reducing the amount of viaduct, and altering the line to avoid settlements and important heritage sites. We have ensured that the Chilterns will be crossed predominantly in tunnels and deep cutting and we expect to plant two million trees along the route from London to Birmingham. And for those who, despite our best efforts at mitigation, are still negatively affected, we are consulting on options for an extra-statutory scheme, offering greater protection than the statutory compensation scheme. In the meantime, we have launched an Exceptional Hardship scheme for homeowners who need to relocate urgently, and whose property values have been affected by the published route proposal.

## What's next

The importance of the project is reflected in the scale of the consultation: this is one of the most comprehensive, wide-ranging and inclusive consultations Government has ever undertaken. Alongside it, we are publishing a detailed economic case and a full Appraisal of Sustainability. It is a real consultation. We want to hear the views of people from across Britain on these exciting proposals. Which means this is just the first stage in an ongoing process.

And I guarantee this: no final decisions will be taken until everyone has had the chance to have their say. Now is the time for people to speak up and make their voices heard: Passengers, local communities, business, environmental groups. And the railway industry. Not just along the line of the first phase route - but across the country, here in the West Midlands, in our great Northern cities, and in Scotland. We want to hear from all of them, to help us reach the right decision, in the national interest. We will analyse the contributions, and publish our response, setting out our proposed way forward, in December 2011. If our decision is to proceed, we will aim to get a hybrid bill for the London-Birmingham route on to the statue book by 2015.

## Concluding remarks

The urgent need to support economic growth **and to** decarbonise our economy means that the time for high speed rail in Britain has come. Today, we have set out our case for HS2. We will take that case to the regions of Britain. And we'll take it to the communities along the line of route. We will show how High Speed Rail can transform the face of Britain's economy - with more growth, more jobs and more prosperity. And we will show, too, how we will mitigate the local impacts of the proposed line. Maximising the benefits and minimising the burdens.

We have before us a once in a lifetime opportunity. An opportunity to reshape our economic geography and secure our future with the benefits of High Speed Rail. Too often in the past, Britain has baulked at the big decisions. This time, let us look resolutely to the future and seize this prize.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20110302,Speech to British Transport Police Federation Annual Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Many thanks for that introduction and for inviting me to address your national conference. I'm sorry I couldn't be with you for your awards ceremony but I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all of the winners. Your bravery awards are always a timely reminder of the debt of gratitude this country owes to the British Transport Police (BTP). Day in, and day out, the BTP's police officers work tirelessly to protect the travelling public, to make our railways, tubes and trams safe and secure ways to travel, putting your own safety on the line to do this. So, as a Rail Minister **and** a rail passenger, I would like to put my tribute on public record and to thank you for all you do.

Every few years it seems that a proposal crops up to subsume you into one or other of the Home Office forces. And I welcome the fact that every time that debate resurfaces, the case is successfully made for retaining a specialist railway police force. With the robust leadership provided by Andy Trotter, I'm certain you'll continue to fend off these take-over attempts. I would like to acknowledge the great work Andy is doing as your Chief Constable. In taking over from Sir Ian Johnston, he had a tough act to follow and I believe the BTP has been very lucky in the exceptional calibre of both its current and its previous chief constables. And I'd also like to praise the work of the British Transport Police Federation and its Chairman, Alex Robertson.

You face a host of operational demands, some of which your chairman outlined in his excellent speech kicking off the conference today. At one end of the spectrum vandalism, drunkenness, mobile phone theft and a host of other crimes this country has already witnessed in the murderous 7/7 attacks. At the other, we've seen the Mumbai killings illustrate another set of risks that could materialise on our rail network. All of this is a reminder, if it were needed, of the pivotal security and anti-terrorism role of the BTP. The Olympics will bring a new set of exacting challenges and your key role in delivering a successful games, is one I fully recognise.

## Public finances

But the work this Federation does, the priorities you campaign on, the issues which matter most to your members, all of these things must be set against the backdrop of the crisis in the public finances and the scale of the deficit the Coalition inherited from our Labour predecessors. This Government's most urgent priority is to tackle that deficit. From our first days in office, through our Emergency Budget to the Spending Review, we've been taking the difficult decisions needed to control spending and put the public finances back on the path to recovery. And let's be clear, painful though some of the spending reductions will be, the consequences of not dealing with the deficit are far worse. We'd be facing spiralling interest rates and the risk of an Irish style budget crisis and bail out. Left un-tackled the debt we inherited, the largest in British peacetime history, would be costing the country £70 billion a year in interest payments alone by the end of this Parliament. That's more than we're spending on policing our streets and defending our country. And there are some things that public finance problems have in common, with a credit card bill, the simple truth is the longer you it leave it the worse it gets. The restoration of fiscal discipline is vital if we are to put this country back on its feet again and deliver the economic stability we need for jobs and growth. But we also recognise the crucial importance of modernising our transport infrastructure to make it an engine of economic growth and a gateway to a better quality of life.

And that's why the Chancellor has placed a priority on transport projects, committing more than  £30 billion of capital investment over the next four years, including, pretty much the biggest programme of rail upgrades in modern history.

## McNulty and efficiency

But the fact is that the cost of running the railways has escalated dramatically over recent years. If we're going to continue to deliver improved services and additional capacity that passengers want, the cost of running the railways has to come down. For the sake of both taxpayers and fare payers, it's imperative that we achieve that goal. So drawing on the work being done by the McNulty Review, we'll be challenging the rail industry to cut its costs. And I'm afraid it would be difficult to justify exempting the BTP from those efforts. I very much welcome the efforts you are already making to drive down costs and improve efficiency and I accept that the Olympics is a special case which requires separate consideration but I'm certain that the BTPA and the rail industry will rightly want to press for savings over the years to come. And given the amount of public money supporting the train operators, Network Rail and the London Underground, the cost of the BTP does have a direct bearing on the public finances, even though your funding structure is different from your Home Office counterparts. I'm confident that the innovation and dedication your force has always demonstrated will enable you to meet this new challenge successfully and to find ways to deliver top class policing outcomes within a the tighter funding environment which I'm afraid the crisis in the public finances makes inevitable.

## Pay and pensions

In his speech, your chairman touched on the Winsor Review. Of course I fully understand your anxiety about what the outcome might be. This will be the most comprehensive independent review of police pay and conditions in more than 30 years. Working alongside police officers and their representatives, Tom Winsor's key objective is to ensure that chief constables can deliver the frontline services people want, while securing value for money. And as Tom has made clear, his over-riding principle while conducting this review is fairness - _""fairness to police officers and fairness to the taxpayer""_. Your Chairman also referred to the Hutton Review and the indirect impact it might potentially have on the BTP pension fund, separate though that is, from the public sector schemes which Lord Hutton is considering. Pensions' reform is a massive challenge. Successive Governments have put this issue in the 'too difficult' box. Well, the state of the public finances means that is no longer a viable option. But we have already made it clear that this is not a race to the bottom. We have decisively rejected this option. Lord Hutton's remit is to come up with reforms that put public sector pensions on a more sustainable financial footing but do so in a way which is fair both to the workforce and to taxpayers. We want to see public service pensions as a gold standard, once again providing a benchmark for the private sector to aspire towards. Staying with pensions for a moment, in his speech, Alex expressed concern about the costs of the Pension Protection Fund. I understand why this matters to your members. So, officials from my Department have been talking to the PPF on this issue to see if we can find a way to address some of your concerns.

And there are a number of other ways in which the Department for Transport is engaged on matters raised with us by the BTP. For example, we're giving very active consideration to the BTP's request for an armed unit. I welcome the progress being made on this issue. I know also that you have long argued that the football authorities and football clubs should take more responsibility for the costs they impose on police forces in general and the BTP in particular. Well, there are no simple solutions on that issue but I have taken it up with my colleagues at the Home Office and DCMS to explore whether change might be feasible.

## Rising to the challenge

Beyond question these are testing times. But if anyone has what it takes to meet the challenge then it's the BTP. By way of proof Alex pointed to some very impressive improvements in crime and detection stats from the BTP's annual performance figures. In fact, over the past six years, crime on Britain's railways is down a remarkable 25%, while the detection rate has improved by 18 points over the same period. It now stands at its highest level ever. These results speak far more eloquently than I ever could about the courage, commitment and dedication of all those who work for the British Transport Police. For example, your 'Safer Stations, Safer Journeys' programme has helped reduce crime through high-visibility patrolling of stations and trains. You have also provided invaluable support to officials in my Department on initiatives like the Secure Stations Scheme which can have a real impact on quality of life for millions of commuters.

And I fully recognise the value of the work the BTP is doing to combat cable theft. Metal thieves targeting the railway are causing misery to thousands of passengers and freight users, because of the major disruption they cause. Network Rail anticipates that by the end of 2011, around 500,000 minutes of delay will have been caused by cable theft. I welcome the joint work being done by the BTP, the Home Office and Network Rail to tackle this crime, not least by trying to make it much more difficult for thieves to get cash for stolen metal. But perhaps the aspect of your working practices that I admire the most is the approach you take to getting the railway up and running again as quickly as possible after an incident on the line.

The leadership and officers of the BTP demonstrate a real awareness of the damaging economic consequences of prolonged railway shutdowns, not to mention the inconvenience and frustration for passengers. I think there are lessons here for the way we deal with incidents on the road and motorway network. I've repeatedly expressed enthusiasm for spreading best practice from rail to road in this context.

## Conclusion

So in conclusion, for some two centuries, the men and women who tackle crime on our railways have been at the forefront of policing. I'm certain that the British Transport Police will continue to play a pivotal role in the success of this country's railways. And that's because your members and the unique police force in which they serve, are the people who day after day risk their own personal safety in keeping railways safe for others. In so doing, they are, as your Chairman said in his speech, part of the bedrock of democracy. So I thank you once again for what you do to protect the travelling public and I thank you for listening to what I've had to say today.

Many thanks to all who have turned up early in the morning for this. One of the problems about addressing people at the start of a conference is having to do the ""housekeeping announcements"" - what to do in the event of a fire and so on. Well, I used to be a fireman, so if there _is_ a fire, follow me!

The main message I wish to give today is that it is vitally important that you see Government as a friend rather than as a hindrance. We don't want to prevent you carrying out business and developing new industry; rather, we want to support you.

The brief given to me today (which, to the delight of my civil servants, I am not going to follow completely), mentions safer roads, safer technology, and greener technology. What I will also lay particular stress on is the issue of growth. You don't need me to lecture you about this country's financial situation. But no matter how many cuts we make - and I think that this department has done relatively well out of the recent spending decisions - we cannot get out of the financial situation we are in without growth. Growth necessarily involves better transport. And better transport means sweating our assets, and using them in a better, greener, way.

Introducing new technology is very important to this. However, even if, tomorrow, every single car on the road were to be an electric one, we'd still have the issues of road safety and road infrastructure to deal with. My Department is already looking at ways to improve both areas; you will hear a lot about managed motorways and average speed cameras, and we are very keen to continue on this. But the question for today is: what else can be done? What can be done now, and in the mid-term, and then in the long-term?

I should mention that in this part of the world, a lot of what we are thinking about is a novelty. Countries such as Japan have already made significant progress, and Europe will have to catch up, and catch up fast.

I hope that, today, we will learn something from you and that you will learn something from us. In front of you, you have a new team, both in terms of the Ministers in the Department for Transport, and, more widely, in the new Coalition Government. Therefore, please consider this the first stage of a new relationship with a new team, a relationship using new processes. Come to us with your ideas and your inventions, for today, tomorrow, and the future, and we will listen. Together, let's get this country going!

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20110317,"Speech to Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport Forum","Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Thank you for that introduction. Finding the best way for aviation to grow sustainably and successfully is among the most important transport challenges we face in the modern world.  This morning, some of the most knowledgeable commentators from different sides of the debate have discussed their perspectives on that difficult task. I'm delighted now to have this opportunity to set out elements of the Coalition's approach to delivering an aviation industry that can thrive and prosper while alsoaddressing its local environmental impacts and plays its part in combating climate change.

Today, aviation generates around £11 billion a year and employs around 200,000 people directly. It drives our multi-billion pound tourism sector and it helps this island nation trade with the rest of the world by providing vital international connectivity.  On the other hand, as other sectors start to decarbonise, aviation's overall share of carbon emissions looks set to grow significantly in future years unless action is taken. But I think it's a mistake to see this issue as a binary choice between economic and environmental concerns. The steps needed to decarbonise the economy can open up significant economic opportunities for this country.

Over the past three years this country has learned a bitter lesson that unsustainable growth fuelled by spiralling levels of government and personal debt can end up being counter-productive and fraught with risk. Well growth which is very heavily dependent on dwindling supplies of fossil fuels and which leaves a hugely expensive climate legacy for future generations also has a major economic downside. As we see Middle East instability push oil prices up the energy security benefits of decarbonising our economy become ever clearer.

## The Coalition's approach

One of the Coalition's first acts in Government was to cancel the third runway at Heathrow and make clear that we would not support new runways at Gatwick or Stansted. Building new runways at our three busiest airports would have made it more difficult to meet our commitments on climate change and left us paying too high a price in terms of the local environmental impact on surrounding communities. The DfT Business Plan promises to make the promotion of sustainable aviation one of our five overall priorities for structural reform.

In a few weeks time, we will publish an aviation policy scoping document, asking strategic questions to inform the development of a sustainable framework for the future of UK aviation. We aim to conclude that process in 2013 after a wide ranging national debate and extensive engagement with industry, environmentalists, community groups and the full range of stakeholders.

In recent years, the debate has become increasingly polarised. We want to try to build more of a consensus that recognises the crucial benefits that aviation brings to our society and our economy, but also acknowledges the need for restraint and for aviation to do more to address its environmental impacts. However, the process for producing that strategy over the next two years does not mean we stand still on our efforts to deliver important aviation policy goals.

## Better not bigger

I fully recognise how vital it is that our major airports provide efficient and high quality gateways to the rest of the world. So I want to emphasise that our decision to reject three new runways does not mean that we don't care about the quality of service provided by our airports. Our decision to reject those three runways means that it has become even more important to make the most of the airport capacity we already have, in the UK in general and south east in particular. I strongly believe that there are significant changes we can make to improve the quality of the passenger experience within current capacity constraints. In short, it is possible to make our airports better without having to make them bigger and we've got a range of initiatives underway to deliver that.

We will be introducing legislation in the next Parliamentary session to modernise and improve airport economic regulation to improve the quality of service that passengers receive at designated airports. Rather than focusing the bulk of regulatory action on a single price review every five years, the new licence based system we propose should enhance the effectiveness of the CAA by enabling it to intervene more quickly if an airport is failing its customers.  Put simply, we'll give the CAA the powers it needs to become a more responsive regulator throughout the control period, not just every five years.

We have established the South East Airports Taskforce to harness industry expertise to help deliver the change needed to improve the passenger experience for air travellers. The remit of the Taskforce focuses on Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted but I firmly believe that its work will also benefit other airports across the country.

We want to create the right conditions for regional airports to flourish.  They have an important role to play in the regional economies we want ensure they are successful as part of our efforts to close the prosperity gap between north and south. So it is important that the work of the Taskforce benefits airports across the country.

The issues the group is considering include border queues, security and resilience. Securing our border against crime, terror and illegal immigration is vital in these difficult times. We are working with the Home Office and the UK Border Agency on improving the way border checks are conducted for air passengers. The impressive work being done by UKBA, particularly with new technology, is focused on delivering this crucial policy goal in a way which minimises inconvenience for passengers.

We are also analysing ways in which the regulatory framework for aviation security might be reformed to address security queues and improve efficiency while maintaining the same high levels of passenger security, or better. The aviation industry told us that the system we inherited from the last Government can be too prescriptive and process-driven. So we are working on a fresh approach that will set the industry demanding outcomes to achieve but give them more flexibility to find the best and most efficient and passenger friendly way to deliver those outcomes.

A Taskforce sub-group led by the CAA is looking at resilience and delays.  We hope to find collaborative solutions and improvements to operating practices that both airports and airlines can sign up to. Getting buy in from both sides can enhance the effectiveness of the changes we're discussing.

I also believe that delivering the Single European Sky programme could deliver major improvements on delays, resilience and airport efficiency.  The issue it's designed to address can perhaps best be illustrated by the following facts. Europe has around 60 major air traffic control centres. The US has less than half that number but manages more than double the number of flights.  Rather than splitting responsibility along national boundaries, the Single European Sky project aims to see airspace managed using much larger units known as Functional Airspace blocks. Our British and Irish FAB is the first to be operational in Europe and is already delivering improvements in fuel consumption and emission reductions. SES has the potential to generate economic, safety and environmental benefits; crucially it could reduce the need for stacking.

## International action

But we also need action at a global level if we are to deliver a sustainable and successful future for aviation. So we will press ahead with efforts to negotiate access for UK based airlines to new markets. We're also committed to including aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System. We are also working through ICAO and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to push for international agreement on aviation emissions. Progress has been slow in recent years but the first major ICAO conference in which this Government took part saw a modest step forward. ICAO adopted an aspirational global goal for stabilising emissions from international civil aviation from 2020 onwards. We are also actively contributing to technical work to set international CO2 emissions standards for new aircraft types, and to devise metrics for reporting aviation CO2 emissions.  It may not grab headlines but this detailed work is pivotal if we are to make real progress at a global level.

## Technology

Technology is of course crucial to delivering our aviation policy goals and Britain can be at the forefront of that technological change. Indeed, UK technology and know-how is already playing a major role in making commercial airliners more fuel efficient.  We can be proud of the fact that new aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner feature so much British engineering excellence, including British wings and British engines.  Together these new aircraft will increase efficiency for passengers, reduce emissions around airports and help address noise problems. And over the horizon, I hope we can look forward to real advances on biofuels. Though I think it's wise to admit there is no miracle technical solution round the corner on carbon or noise, technology may provide some of the answers.

## Noise

Through ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection, we are making a similar contribution to technical work on international noise standards for new aircraft types. We fully recognise the concern felt about aircraft noise and the impact it has on quality of life. This was a key factor in our decision to say no to new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. So early in my tenure as Aviation Minister I confirmed we would not revive Labour's proposals on mixed mode and that we could continue to support runway alternation at Heathrow and the much valued respite it provides for those under the airport's densely occupied flight path.

We want to provide clear and stretching objectives for industry to reduce noise impact of flights by improving aircraft technology and operating procedures. And we're working through ICAO to deliver that on an international basis, as well improvements air navigation and airspace management to deliver quieter approaches and climbs. That's in addition to the progress we are pushing for through the CAA's Future Airspace Strategy and the SES programme I've already referred to.

And of course I'm acutely aware that the debate on night noise will intensify in the coming months. I fully recognise that night noise is widely accepted as one of the least acceptable impacts of aviation. The current night restrictions regime for the three main London airports is due to expire in October next year.  I know that the stakeholders and communities affected are keenly waiting news on this. I would like to assure this audience that I consider this to be one of the most important tasks I will face as Aviation Minister and that getting the right answer on this issue is a personal priority for me.  I hope to make an announcement soon about how the process will go forward for establishing the successor arrangements to the current regime.

## High Speed Rail

Ladies and gentlemen, today I've tried to give you a snapshot of some of the work we are doing to improve our airports and promote sustainable aviation, but I want to cover one last crucial element of our strategy for getting the best out of our airports and that is our ambitious plans to deliver a high speed rail network for this country. Experience around Europe shows how attractive high speed rail journeys are when they compete with short haul aviation. Taking just two examples of many, Air France has entirely stopped flying between Paris and Brussels and charters high speed TGV trains instead, and flights between Madrid and Barcelona plummeted when the high speed line opened. The high speed network we propose connecting London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds will have consequences beyond those cities. For example, running trains on to the new network from Scotland could cut journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London to as little as 3_ hours. Now Deutsche Bahn hope to start running direct services from London to Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Cologne, in addition to Eurostar's Brussels and Paris routes.  At present, there are probably around 140,000 flights every year between these destinations and airports in the South East. 140,000 flights! Providing a viable rail substitute for even a modest proportion of those flights could release significant capacity at our crowded airports, enabling them to focus on routes where flying is the only option, such as for long haul and brick economy destinations, enabling us to get better economic value from our airports within current capacity constraints.

Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that completion of the high speed rail network we propose be a long and arduous process. You only have to glance at the pages of the national newspapers every morning to realise that, but I firmly believe that it will be worth the effort. Not just because our plans will radically change the economic geography of this country and help us tackle a north south divide problem which has defied solution for decades, but also because high speed rail can transform the debate that has raged for some many years on airport capacity in the South East.  Formidable challenges lie ahead, whether it's on high speed rail or the future of aviation. I look forward to working with you all in addresses those challenges so that we deliver the sustainable growth and sustainable aviation that we need for a successful and competitive future for the UK economy.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-20110317,High Speed Rail,"Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","At the end of February, the Government launched a [public consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/) on building a new national high speed rail system.

Not just any consultation - but one of the biggest and potentially most far reaching consultations in Government history.

Its size and complexity reflects the importance of high speed rail to Britain's future.

For the proposed scheme not only promises to revolutionise intercity travel in the 21st century.

It is also a once-in-a-generation chance to bring our leading cities closer together, to reshape our economic geography and to deliver the growth, jobs and investment that will be crucial to the future prosperity of this country.

And I mean the prosperity of the whole country.

High speed rail is not only good for Britain, and for the cities it directly connects.

It's also good for the people and the businesses of Glasgow and Scotland.

Faster journeys. Better connectivity. And a step change in transport capacity on major routes.

So we are here today to take the debate on high speed to Scotland.

To present the facts. To set out the arguments. But also to acknowledge the challenges ahead, so people in Scotland can make their own minds up about a scheme of huge consequence, that has the potential to deliver radical long-term change to this country.

## North versus south

Despite the growth and diversification that cities like Glasgow have experienced in recent years, the fact remains that the economies of Scotland and North England continue to lag behind the South East.

Over the past decade, around half the UK's economic growth has been concentrated in London and the surrounding regions. If other parts of the country had been able to match this rate of growth, the UK would have been £38 billion better off.

If we want sustainable growth, we need it to be geographically balanced - with a more competitive, prosperous Scotland playing its part in the success of the British economy.

And one of the most effective ways to balance growth is through infrastructure investment.

Transport infrastructure, in particular, has a vital role to play - providing the crucial links on busy intercity routes that enable businesses to operate efficiently and profitably.

But just as good transport enables economic growth, bad, congested transport acts as an obstacle to growth.

That is why we need to ensure that we have the capacity on our key transport arteries to meet rising demand in the future.

## Capacity problem

Between 1994 and 2009, for example, the number of miles travelled by rail passengers in Britain soared - from 18 billion to 32 billion.

And demand is predicted to continue rising.

Passengers travelling to or from Scotland on the West and East Coast Main Lines will already know how overcrowded those services can become - particularly as they approach London. And motorists here will know how congestion on the road and motorway network has made journeys less reliable.

Ignoring the problem is simply not an option.

Severe overcrowding on the railway would spread throughout the day; and the performance of the network would deteriorate. More passengers would be forced onto short-haul air services or onto the road network, generating ever-rising levels of carbon.

Intercity travel in Britain would become increasingly slow and unreliable, further undermining the economies of our major cities and regions.

## High speed rail

The evidence from abroad is that high speed rail is the only effective, sustainable, answer to our inter-city transport challenges. Many of our competitors already recognise the huge benefits that high speed rail can bring, and are pressing ahead with ambitious plans.

Across Europe and Asia, high speed has delivered more capacity, reliability, comfort and accessibility for travellers.

What's more, high speed has delivered for their economies - creating the jobs and regeneration that we could expect to see in this country if a new national high speed network goes ahead.

And it has helped reduce carbon emissions by encouraging people off cars and planes onto trains. Flights between Paris and Brussels, for example, have all but come to an end; and air traffic between Madrid and Barcelona is in dramatic decline since high speed lines were built in Spain.

So it is clear: Britain simply cannot afford to be left behind.

That is why the Government has announced its plan for a Y-shaped national high speed rail network, linking London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, with additional stations serving South Yorkshire and the East Midlands.

Connections to the West Coast and East Coast Main Lines would enable through-running high speed rail services to reach Glasgow and Edinburgh via the conventional network.

Journey times from Scotland's major cities to London would be cut to around 3 hours 30 minutes - an hour less than many of today's services - and on modern, high capacity trains.

And by linking up with Heathrow and the Channel Tunnel, we would massively improve international connectivity for the whole of the UK.

When it comes to modal shift, it is worth looking in more detail at the numbers.

In 2009, there were around seven million passenger trips by rail and air combined between London and Edinburgh and Glasgow.

In 2009, only around 20% of these trips were made by rail, whereas, on the basis of our analysis, with the Y-shaped network in place, high speed rail could capture around half of this market.

Transferring long distance services to the high speed line would also release capacity on other major rail routes, allowing substantially improved commuter services and new opportunities for freight between Scotland and England.

High speed rail would generate benefits of around £44 billion over 60 years, that it would support thousands of jobs and regenerate inner cities.

But it would also do much more by, for example, harnessing improved city-to-city links and increasing business productivity.

## Impacts

Of course, the consultation is an opportunity for everyone to have their say about our proposals for high speed.

I know that many people have concerns.

And that is why we have gone to very great lengths to mitigate the environmental impacts of the line.

Already we have altered half the original proposals for a London-West Midlands line to reduce potential local environmental impacts. And in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, we have made sure that all but 1.2 miles would be in tunnel, cutting, or close to the A413 road corridor

So we are listening, we take people's views seriously, and we will take them fully into account during the consultation.

That is what today is all about. This seminar is just one of a number of seminars we're holding up and down the country - and we are also holding a series of roadshows for local people along the line of the recommended route.

Scotland is vital to this project because HS2 would deliver significant benefits for travellers from north of the border - speeding up journey times and providing new capacity on routes into London.

And the Government's proposed network could also provide a strong foundation for subsequent expansion in the longer-term - reducing journey times to Glasgow and Edinburgh further.

I know that your aspiration is for the network to reach Scotland directly. That is something that the Secretary of State has said that we will look at in detail with the Scottish Government and on which we welcome your views as part of the consultation.

So we need to hear what you have to say.

No final decisions will be taken until everyone has had the chance to do so.

But if like me you regard high speed rail as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver transformational change on a national scale.

If you are fed up with short term fixes and desperate for the sort of transport system that other countries now take for granted.

If you realise that Scotland and the whole of the UK stand to benefit directly from our plans, then I then I ask you to speak up in favour of this project as the consultation proceeds. We need your support.

Now is the time to make your voices heard: passengers, local communities, businesses, environmental groups and the railway industry.

We will analyse your contributions, and publish our response, setting out our proposed way forward, in December this year.

I hope this will be the start of a process that delivers a modern, world class transport system for Britain - and for Scotland.

Thank you.

The room we are in today brings back memories for me as it was here 8 months ago that I made my first speech as shipping Minister, a role which for many might have seemed a little unusual considering the fact that my constituency is arguably further away than any other in the country from sea!

I think this played no small part in my selection as shipping minister; it meant I would question why. It does, however, also mean that I am never going to be an expert on the subject, those who sit around this table today are the experts. I am simply here to help where I can.

I believe that for a such as this today have great significance - and I would like to say how despite to commitments of diary I wanted to be here - I wanted to pledge my support to LEPs and particularly to my good friend George Keiffer in his role as Chairman of the Kent, Greater Essex and East Sussex LEP.

Will in his introduction has briefly mentioned some of the issues he would like me to cover today, so I will try my best to give you as much information as I can:

  * The NPS is still very much in the pipeline, and I can confirm that we intend to lay the ports national policy statement in September with a view to designation in October, subject to Parliamentary approval.
  * Regarding trust ports, as I have always been keen to express, one size does not fit all. There are over 90 trust ports, and each and every one of them works differently. I want to ensure that all trust ports are fit for purpose. Not only for the industry that works within them, but for the communities that thrive because of them. But wider still, I am continuing to look at all ports, be they trust, municipal or private.
  * The McNulty review is imminent, and we are all surely agreed that there is scope for greater efficiency in the rail industry, both for passengers and for freight. That is what the McNulty study is aiming for, where that makes economic and environmental sense.
  * Offshore renewables are great opportunities for ports around the country. It is important that decisions on manufacturers' applications should be made as early as possible as to have a clear understanding of who will be doing what. Equally we need to look to the long term and what is to come in the future, be it more fabrication or operations and maintenance.
  * And there are other opportunities for ports across the whole range of energy generation, including other alternatives to fossil fuels such as nuclear power stations, many of which are of course coastally-located.
  * So I support renewable energy but it isn't the only answer.  For us to fully tackle CO2 emissions I believe there needs also to be a renaissance in coastal shipping.

No matter what we do the country cannot get out of the mess it is currently in without the help of the ports industry. 96% of everything the country needs comes through you and you are the driver of growth.

  * Do I have the money to build all the roads you want? No.
  * Are we looking at new innovative ways of improving the A14? Yes.
  * Are there plans to improve the Dartford crossing? Yes.
  * Are we looking at an additional Thames crossing? Yes.

The Government is listening and I truly believe LEPs are a great opportunity. You in the industry need to use this opportunity to sing from the same hymn sheet and not burden yourselves with bureaucracy. It will be a breath of fresh air.

My door is always open, many of you have met me and I invite those of you that haven't to do so. I thank you for listening and I hope you all enjoy the rest of the day.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20110511,Strategic Framework for Road Safety,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","Each year an incredible 1.3 million people are killed and 50 million are injured on the world's roads. Politicians often use words like incredible, but when I saw those figures I asked someone to check them. They are correct and they are mind-numbing figures. Equally chilling is the fact that, on current trends, road fatalities could become the world's fifth biggest killer by 2030. These facts and figures demonstrate that road safety is a truly global issue. They also remind us of the motivation for the UN Decade of Action - a decade in which, with the right focus, action and policies, countless lives will be saved in the years ahead.

Britain is rightly proud of its road safety record. Our highways are among the safest roads in the world and we have seen significant decreases in our casualty figures. But, in spite of all we have achieved, we still lose six or seven people to road accidents in this country every day of the week. Every road death is a grim statistic - but it is also a personal tragedy. And, as well as the terrible human cost, there is a heavy economic price to pay. Again, I had to have these figures checked - in Britain, the economic welfare costs are estimated at around £16 billion a year, while insurance payouts for motoring claims alone are now over £12 billion a year.

So there is no room for complacency - and that's why today the Government has launched its new Strategic Framework for Road Safety. The core principle underpinning our new strategy is that, with limited resources available, we need to target the most dangerous behaviours: focusing police and court time on those who deliberately engage in anti-social and dangerous driving behaviour, while supporting the generally law-abiding motorist to address poor driving skills or lapses of behaviour that could put him or her and other road users at risk.

### Education

The strategy will be delivered both nationally and locally. The new Framework sets out those measures that we intend to take nationally, together with the areas where policy and delivery will reflect local priorities and circumstances. The national measures focus on two key strands - education and enforcement. Let me take each of them in turn. As I've said, we want to support basically law-abiding road users to address poor driving skills - to nudge their behaviour in the right direction. That means more educational options for drivers who make genuine mistakes, display poor skills or commit occasional low level offences - to improve their driving, support to develop safer skills and appropriate attitudes to driving. In appropriate cases, low level offenders will be offered a place on a police-approved education course (at their cost) instead of a fixed penalty charges and licence points. We know from experience that properly designed education courses can have a positive impact on driving behaviour. But our education initiative will go further: we will reform the regime for rehabiliting disqualified drivers - so that the most serious offenders who are disqualified from driving have to complete re-training and a mandatory new test before they regain their licence.

We will also continue to build on the recent improvements we've made to our driving and motorcycle tests And we'll develop a new post-driving test vocational qualification - designed to help newly qualified drivers gain the necessary skills and experience to be safe and responsible road users - and to demonstrate that they have gained those skills to would-be insurers. The better the education and the better the training, the more we can enhance the safety of all road users, whether they are pedestrians or cyclists, drivers or motorcyclists. I also want to correct what I believe has been an overly narrow emphasis on automatically-detected speed-related offences, at the expense of tackling other equally or more risky behaviours such as tailgating, under-taking and weaving.

Since 1985 the number of prosecutions for careless driving has plummeted by three-quarters as time-consuming prosecution through the courts has been deemed a lower priority by police. So we will introduce a new fixed penalty notice for careless driving to help the police to tackle risky behaviour, such as tailgating, that currently tends to go unenforced, in an efficient and effective manner. Freeing up police and court resources to focus on the most dangerous drivers. This will also enable careless driving offenders to be diverted to the new educational courses offered where appropriate to those receiving fixed penalty notices. At the same time, we will increase the level of fixed penalty notices for many road traffic offences from £60 to £80-£100 plus penalty points. The current levels have fallen behind other fixed penalties offences and the lower levels for traffic offences risk trivialising the offences.

### Enforcement

Sadly, it isn't just about educating the well-intentioned. Alongside those who make genuine mistakes or have poor skills, but who want to do the right thing, there are also a minority hard-core of dangerous road users who commit serious, deliberate and repeated offences. Not because of poor skills, but because of bad attitude - and a reckless disregard of risk. These people are a danger to themselves and to others and, in order to tackle their negligence and target their recklessness, we will enhance the enforcement and sanctions regime. An effective deterrent requires credible sanctions. So, in addition to using innovative ways to recover unpaid fines, we will also work to make full use of existing powers for the courts to seize and crush an offender's vehicle.

I'm also determined to increase the effectiveness of drink and drug drive enforcement and cut reoffending, as set out in our response to the North report on Drink and Drug Driving in March. One of the great successes of road safety over the last 40 years has been the extent to which drink driving has become socially unacceptable - and largely in consequence, the number of people killed in drink driving accidents has fallen by more than 75% since 1979. But sadly, people are still losing their lives because of drink driving - in 2009, 380 people were killed in drink driving collisions - about 17% of all of the fatalities on the road for that year. So we need to take tough action against the small minority of drivers who don't give a second thought to the law and who put their lives in danger by drink driving and also the lives of others. They have ignored the shift in social attitudes; they ignore the risks they are taking and they ignore the drink driving limit. Shockingly, 40% of those who fail the alcohol breath test are more than two and a half times the permitted limit. A lower limit would not make this reckless minority change their behaviour. Their behaviour is entrenched- and so we have concluded that improving enforcement will have more impact on these dangerous people than lowering the limit.

So we are toughening up the enforcement regimes. We are revoking the right for drivers who are over the limit on a breath test to request a blood or urine test - eliminating the opportunity for delay that over the years has allowed countless drink drivers to get away with their offence. We will also be launching a more robust drink-drive rehabilitation scheme, providing high quality education courses, and requiring drink-drivers who were substantially over the limit to take remedial training and a linked driving assessment - as well as a medical examination - before recovering their licence.

Drink driving kills. But it is just as dangerous for people to drive impaired by drugs, and it is quite wrong that it is easier at present to get away with one than the other. So there needs to be a clear message that drug-drivers are as likely to be caught and punished as drink-drivers. We are working to approve drug testing devices and we will change the law to speed up the testing process, ensuring the police can bring drug drivers to justice.  We are also exploring the introduction of a new offence - alongside the existing offence - which would relieve the need for the police to prove impairment case-by-case where a specified drug at a specified level has been detected in the blood stream. We are determined, over time, to make drug-driving as socially unacceptable as drink-driving has become.

There is also a significant correlation between uninsured driving and other road traffic offending. While we believe we will now make progress against uninsured drivers - with the introduction of Continuous Insurance Enforcement - we are clear that this is an area that requires further work to arrive at a fully effective package of measures. The rising cost of insurance will surely tempt more and more to take the risk. So we will consider introducing proportionate penalties for uninsured driving, to ensure that the cost of offending is better matched to the cost of insurance, while continuing to work with the insurance industry on measures that help to reduce the cost of motor insurance to make it more affordable over time.

### Localism

Our new Strategy we are publishing today makes it clear that, while targets sometimes have their place, we do not consider over-arching national targets to be the most appropriate means of improving road safety in Britain. None-the-less, government at the national level has a crucial part to play in improving road safety - from delivering better driving standards and testing, to enhancing enforcement and education, right through to the way it manages the country's strategic road infrastructure. So yes, we recognise the positive difference that central Government can make. But we also believe in the potential and possibilities offered by localism. And that's why our Strategic Framework acknowledges that local communities also have a vital role in making roads as safe as they can be. Local service deliverers do not need civil servants in Whitehall to tell them how important road safety is. Nor do they need central diktats that constrain their local ambitions and priorities.

Instead of more suffocating bureaucracy and top down government, we will devolve decision making and empower people at the local level. Enabling the creation of local solutions tailored to meet local challenges - recognising that the road safety challenges we face are different in different parts of the country - whether it is setting local speed limits, or choosing the most appropriate traffic management schemes. By giving local authorities more freedom to assess and act on their own priorities, we will see better targeted, more effective local action. We will provide an economic toolkit to assist local authorities in assessing the full costs and benefits when considering speed limits - helping them to ensure that their decisions on speed limits are consistent and transparent to the communities they serve. And we will move to a more sophisticated method of monitoring progress through a Road Safety Outcomes Framework, which will help local authorities assess and prioritise their action as well as showing the impact of central Government measures.

We also want citizens to play a more active role in championing the cause of road safety in their areas. So we will ensure that more information is made available to help them to hold their local authorities and service providers to account and to enable them to compare the performance of their area against other similar areas. And that ability to compare is critical, the gap between the best and worst performing authorities is very significant. If the bottom half of highway authorities upped their game to the mid point authority, the number of killed and seriously injured casualties could decrease by 14%... that's 3,500 fewer deaths or seriously injured every year. Our localism agenda is a radical transfer of power and information from Whitehall to the town hall and from Downing Street to the local High Street. It helps to build capacity, increase transparency and strengthen accountability. And it will enable local people to come together, to work together and build the types of neighbourhoods and communities that they want to live in.

### Concluding remarks

Road safety is everybody's business - we all have a stake in making our highways as safe as they can be. And in spreading our best practice in the UK to the many parts of the world with road safety records that are very far behind. That's why the UN Decade of Action is so important. It's also why road safety is a first order issue for me and for this Government. Britain has made great progress down the years in making our roads safer. We want that progress to continue and the Strategic Framework we are publishing today will take that agenda forward. My very clear message today is that we will work with the grain of human nature: encouraging and assisting drivers who occasionally lapse or who suffer from poor skills - the basically law-abiding majority - to become a safe and responsible motorists. We are not against them, we are with them and we will work to help them. But on those who wilfully and recklessly put themselves and others at risk, we will focus the resources of law-enforcement with a new determination.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20110526,Speech at the Transport Times Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","This event is very much about the shape of things to come - about what transport might look like in the years ahead. We all know that predicting the future can be a hazardous business. None other than the eminent scientist William Kelvin predicted there was no future for radio and that heavier than air flying machines were an impossibility. In 1943 the then chairman of IBM forecast that there would be a world market for just 5 computers in total. Despite those risks, I think it's worth speculating about what might lie beyond the horizon for the transport sector. I believe that technology has huge potential to deliver a smarter more efficient transport system in the years to come. I'm sure everyone here will agree that improving our transport system can provide immense benefits for our economy and our quality of life. But our options for making transport better aren't confined to new road and rail links, or renewing and upgrading existing infrastructure, important as those are.

It is clear that the future of transport goes well beyond, tarmac, concrete and steel. New technology gives us the chance to look afresh at problems that have beset the transport system for decades, to approach these seemingly intractable issues from a different angle. As well as the obvious benefits technology can deliver in making our transport system safer, greener and more reliable, a world of smarter travel is one where demand can be more accurately predicted and capacity can be used more efficiently. A smarter system can improve the end-to-end travel experience, delivering more seamless connections between different operators and different modes. It can help spread demand more evenly across the day, a prize sought by transport operators probably for as long as mean and women have been travelling. And it can give transport users much better information flows, empowering them in a way unparalleled in our history. Today, millions of people carry smart phones in their pocket with computing power which would have filled a small room not so long ago. That fact provides all of us who care about improving our transport system with huge opportunities. The DfT's Transport Direct service is used by 20 million people a year, providing door to door journey planning from 30 million locations in the UK, alongside other travel information. And it's available via the internet, mobile channels, digital TV and numerous third party sites. Internet and mobile phone applications are opening up new channels for consumers to communicate and collaborate across the economy. Whether it's the ""Tube Buddy"" application I have on my blackberry showing me the indicator board for High Barnet tube station, or Google maps on GPS making it easier for pedestrians to get around, this all adds up to empowered consumers. And empowered consumers are exactly what this Government wants to see more of - consumers who know their rights and demand them; who drive the development of new products and services; and who can use the new tools and information at their disposal to get the best deals and access the smartest form of travel. That's why we have demonstrated our commitment to transparency through our Open Data policy which has broadened access to a whole range of data sets held by public bodies.

Transparency and data sharing will enable the public to better scrutinise government at both local and national levels. But it will also encourage innovation by dynamic small businesses and provide the public with exciting new services. We have already released key central datasets such as NaPTAN, the comprehensive directory of every public transport location. This has spawned new apps, such as the one that alerts you when you are near your destination railway station. Now, I recognise that there are significant issues to be overcome with broadening access to transport data, most of which is owned by the private sector. However, I think that if we can find a way to resolve these issues in a way which is fair to the people who have invested in the relevant systems, it will be well worth the effort. Opening up and engaging more closely with the entrepreneurs out there hungry to turn transport data into attractive and innovative products for consumers could generate very major benefits for transport operators - namely more customers. In particular, I see this as a real opportunity for the rail industry. I hope that an early demonstration of the decisive industry leadership Sir Roy McNulty recently called for in his study of the railways will be a move towards a much more open approach to data on fares and timetabling.

But no speech on smarter travel would be complete without a look at ITS. The label Intelligent Transport System can embrace systems as diverse as in-car satnav to traffic signals. Or it could be advanced applications that provide travellers with real-time data on everything from bus and train times to traffic updates on delays, accidents and road-works. ITS can help to improve road safety and provide an early warning system for drivers. It can ease traffic congestion and lower journey times, reduce fuel consumption and cut air pollution. ITS can even play a role in the rapid mass evacuation of people in urban centres when there are natural disasters or terrorist threats. The UK has been an early adopter of ITS technologies and is a world leader in using them to support policy goals. One example is our work on managed motorways and hard shoulder running.

Then there is Urban Traffic Management and Control - UTMC - which was developed by the DfT to help urban local authorities engage with the ITS, smart travel agenda. UTMC allows for the sharing of relevant information between individual ITS applications from traffic signal controls to air quality monitoring and car park management. UTMC is now being used by over 100 local authorities.

I should also highlight the new National Traffic Information Service, which we expect to go live in September. Building on the services currently provided by the National Traffic Control Centre, this will collect data from roadside technology and provide intelligence on the state of the network. And it will do this through a range of information channels like local and national radio, Google maps, over 300 partner websites.

Innovative technology is an essential building block for a smart transport future. But so too is changing behaviour. And here I'm talking about the things we can do to persuade, incentivise and nudge people in the direction of smarter travel choices:

  * making public transport a more attractive option;
  * promoting the use of car sharing schemes and car clubs; encouraging people to swap the short car trip for a walk or a bike ride;
  * making it easier for people to cut down on work-related travel and commuting through things like home-working and the use of communications tools such as video-conferencing.

By enabling and empowering people to make more sustainable, smarter transport choices we can help address traffic congestion and its knock on cost effects for business and industry. Not just that, we can also make a difference on issues like obesity, air quality and noise. In other words, smarter choice measures are good for the economy, the environment and for our health. Research has demonstrated that these programmes can be relatively inexpensive to implement and provide excellent value for money. The Sustainable Travel Town project run by the previous Government indicated that smarter choices programmes could deliver a:

  * 9% reduction in car trips;
  * 10-22% increase in bus trips per person;
  * 26-30% increase in cycle trips per person;
  * 10-13% increase in walking trips per person.

This success of this programme was one of the key drivers behind the decision to establish the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. Projects aimed at nudging people towards healthier and more sustainable transport decisions are prime candidates for support from this new £560 million fund. The inclusion of revenue as well as capital funding is deliberately aimed at making it easier for local authorities to include smarter travel projects in their bids since these will often require both types of funding. Of course the urgent need to put the public finances back in order has put pressure on transport budgets at both a national and local level. But we hope the LTSF will help. We've made major efforts to keep the allocation process for the fund as light touch as possible to address the longstanding concerns about the complex bidding process for schemes under the previous Government. We've also carried out a radical simplification of transport funding streams to cut admin costs for local Government and give locally elected councillors much more say over how to allocate resources. That said, there can be no doubt that the record deficit the Coalition inherited has meant we have had to make some very tough decisions. But the Government has given priority to investment in transport, with £30 billion allocated in the CSR period. And we have also tried to minimise the impact of cuts on the area at the heart of this conference today - smart and integrated ticketing.

Ever since I bought my first Oyster card, I've been an huge enthusiast for smart ticketing. I think Oyster helped transform people's attitude to public transport in the capital and demonstrated how popular these schemes can be. The Government wants to see smart and integrated ticketing rolled out more widely across the country. Our stated ambition is to see to enable most public transport journeys in the country to be made using smart ticketing by the end of 2014. We're making some real progress towards that goal. A growing number of ITSO-compliant smart ticketing schemes are in operation or development across England. The Scottish and Welsh national schemes are also ITSO-compliant. We have provided £20 million of grant funding to the nine biggest urban areas in England outside of London to help to roll out the infrastructure needed. We also continue to offer a BSOG incentive of 8% for operators with operational ITSO smart systems on their buses. A number of the biggest bus operators are rolling out smart ticketing and obligations on smart ticketing are being included in newly tendered rail franchises. We are also working with TfL to deliver new ITSO compatible smart readers across the London Oyster estate. On top of these measures and initiatives we are working with the transport industry on the development of e-purses and will support the development of commercial agreements between partners to improve integration and compatibility between smart ticketing schemes. An excellent example of productive partnership is provided by PLUSBUS, where bus and train operators are working with their local communities to deliver a successful rail-bus integrated product. This is now available in over 280 rail-served towns and cities across Britain. We're working with Journey Solutions, ITSO and bus and train operators to investigate whether PLUSBUS might be made available as an ITSO smart product. From seamless travel to convenience of use, I genuinely believe that smart and integrated ticketing offers a revolution in the way we travel. It can allow more sophisticated fare pricing, which can enable people to make smarter choices about when they travel. Last week's McNulty report highlights the way in which ""intelligent ticketing"" could have a part to play in helping to make better use of capacity by spreading demand more evenly over the day. Contrary to what you might read in the papers, this doesn't have to be all stick and no carrot. The sort of products being developed by the companies represented in this room can give us the opportunity to reward and incentivise off-peak travel. The smart technology you are developing can enable us to modernise the season ticket - largely unchanged for decades - so that it adapts to the reality of 21st century working life where many people, especially women, simply no longer fit the standard 9 to 5, Monday to Friday stereotype.

In conclusion, when it comes to smarter ticketing technology, I'm a real enthusiast. I believe that the work now underway by people in this room and across the transport sector has the potential to transform the way we travel and enhance our quality of life. That's why I am so pleased to have had this chance to speak at this conference today and that's why I look forward to hearing your views and taking your questions.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/penning-20110607,FTA Logistics carbon reduction conference,"Speech by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you for the introduction, I am exactly a year and two weeks into my role as Under Secretary of State of Transport and I have comfortably exceeded the average life expectancy of a minister with a portfolio like mine.

I feel I can say I have been a friend to the industry this past year, a constructive friend in what has been a difficult year for both the public and private sector. I'm very pleased to repeat a comment I have received from a member of today's audience that the relationship between the FTA and my officials in my department is the best it has ever been, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank all those involved who work so hard in maintaining this relationship.

One of Government priorities is to create a transport system that is an engine for economic growth, greener and safer. I'm pleased to say I am starting to see signs of this growth again.

The UK freight and logistics sector is vital to economic growth. It is worth around £74.5bn to the economy, employs 2.3m people across 190 000 companies and delivers the country's core needs (food, oil, coal, hospital supplies);

But freight movements also have significant environmental and social impacts. Around 27% of domestic carbon emissions come from freight; and HGVs contribute to many urban air pollution hotspots.

At the heart of my job is a determination to ensure we have the transport networks and proportionate regulations that enable you to do what you do best; but to ensure that the freight and logistics sector is making a contribution towards reducing its emissions.

Instead of the government telling you what you must and must not do I want to tell you that it is my aim to legislate the bare minimum. One of things I can do is reduce the number of rules and regulations - this is absolutely central to the coalition's vision for Britain, removing barriers to economic growth and increasing individual freedoms.

You are hopefully already aware that all Whitehall road transport regulations have been placed on the Red Tape Challenge website for 4 weeks. As De-Regulation Minister I want to hear from everyone; whether you think that a regulation is well designed and provides vital protections, or if you think that a regulation is badly designed, badly implemented or simply a bad idea.

We are working on the presumption that regulations will go, unless it can be justified why a regulation should be kept - so we can free businesses to compete, create jobs and unleash a private sector-led recovery;

I also continue to support modal shift through our grant support scheme. We have a confirmed budget for these grants of £20million for 2011-12 and £19million for 2012-13. An indicative budget is in place of £19million for both 2013-14 and 2014-15.

But you know what you do best; and it is important that you grasp the opportunities being provided by the Government to demonstrate that you as an industry are leaders in supply chain and fuel efficiency.

Our localism agenda provides real opportunities for you as an industry. I would encourage you to get involved in the new Local Enterprise Partnerships which we expect to play a role in taking decisions on local transport priorities.

I welcome today's discussions on the latest factors that can help improve supply chain fuel efficiency and I am grateful for the work that many of you in the room are putting into leading measures to reduce emissions from freight transport. We need more action from the industry as a whole if we are to meet our wider climate change objectives - and especially if road freight is to compete with other sectors in a future low carbon economy.

In October I announced I would not make eco-driving training mandatory, but that I would instead encourage and support industry-led schemes to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.

That is why, in March, I formally endorsed the FTA's Logistics Carbon Reduction Scheme. I really welcome this scheme. The Scheme is the first of its kind for the freight sector, and should deliver real progress toward the UK's carbon reduction targets. It already covers more than 40,000 vehicles - and will expand to cover more. It will help to provide a detailed picture of the quantity and trend of carbon emissions by the freight industry and show that it is capable of working together, voluntarily, to tackle its harmful emissions. I would urge those of you in the room who have not yet signed up to this Scheme to do so.

I want to see continued progress and action. I stated in March that I will review progress from industry-led action in 2012 and re-consider the case for Government intervention and I have written to the Chief Executives of the major freight organisations to highlight the importance I place on this review.

So now is the time for you to put in place measures in your business that will lessen your environmental impacts - and to join up to Schemes such as the FTA's to demonstrate that, as an industry, you can do your part in reducing emissions.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20110609,Speech at the Aviation Club Lunch,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","It's a pleasure to be joining you this afternoon. It's now just over a year since the Coalition came to office. Just over a year since I somewhat unexpectedly - at least to me - became Transport Secretary. And just over a year since the new Government set out its priorities very clearly: cutting the deficit, re-establishing sustainable growth and reducing carbon. And, with that cue, it was pretty straightforward for me arriving in my new Department to define my objectives for the Department for Transport: to ensure that the transport agenda supports economic growth, while contributing to deficit reduction and carbon reduction. And the challenge for my Department, in particular, is to demonstrate that 'supporting economic growth' and 'reducing carbon' are not mutually incompatible aims.

Nowhere more so than in aviation. Virtually the first act of this Government was to announce the scrapping of the third runway at Heathrow - an act which will have come as no surprise to anyone who had read the Conservative or Liberal Democrats manifestos, but which I know many in your industry nonetheless felt was loaded with hostile symbolism. It was not. I made clear at the earliest opportunity - and I want to do so again today - that this Government is not and at least, so long as I am Transport Secretary, will not be, 'anti-aviation'. Far from it.

It understands that the aviation sector is an important part of the economy in its own right - sustaining tens of thousands of jobs - but even more critically, that aviation supports economic growth and the generation of wealth across the whole economy. If we ever had any doubts about our dependence on aviation, the closing of our airspace for 5 days last year will have dispelled them. So we clearly understand that, if our economy is to grow, aviation must also be able to grow. We surely share the starting point. But we are also clear that, with the challenge of global warming as stark as ever, even if attention is understandably focussed at the moment on the short-term economic challenges, that growth cannot be at any cost. So we - the industry and government - must work together to define a growth strategy for aviation that will support UK economic growth, but which will also support the delivery of our decarbonisation commitments.

That is why we have committed to delivering a new Aviation Strategy - and have published a scoping document, setting out our views on the issues that Strategy needs to address. Beginning, I hope, a new chapter in the aviation policy debate. In particular, we must find new ways to incentivise the decarbonisation of air travel - and encourage investment in low-carbon technologies and fuels. Ensuring we can lead the global debate and shape a low-emission aviation sector of the future, without disadvantaging UK airlines or UK airports.

While the inclusion of aviation in the European Emissions Trading System next year is an important step, it is not clear that it alone will provide sufficient incentive to drive innovation quickly or deeply enough. We will continue to work with ICAO and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to push for **international** agreement on aviation emissions, ensuring that the playing field is level as quickly as possible. We saw a step forward - albeit a modest one - last year when ICAO adopted an aspirational goal for stabilising CO2 emissions from 2020.

With the environmental framework increasingly constraining the shape and direction of aviation growth, it is clear that, if we are to continue enjoying the significant benefits of a growing, deregulated aviation industry, then we need to put aviation on a more sustainable footing. So our policy framework must support economic growth and protect Heathrow's status as a global hub. But it must also address aviation's effects on climate change and its impact on local communities. A tall order you might think. Growing the sector, while decarbonising - and all within the constraints we face on local environmental impacts - primarily noise. So, I want to explore with you what the industry expects technological change to be able to deliver, over the next thirty or forty years - on carbon, on noise, on air quality - and on what timescale you expect those development to be made.

This is a resourceful, innovative industry, and I am convinced that there is a solution to these challenges -providing the headroom for growth as first trading, and then technology, provides the answer to the carbon challenge - while the continued progress of engine design will, over time, create headroom for growth by reducing per flight noise impacts. It is vitally important that we get this strategy right, and I have set the timescale for this exercise to ensure that the views of all parts of the industry are properly heard and that all the issues can be fully explored. So we do not expect to publish our new Aviation Strategy until 2013, but by taking the time that is necessary, we will ensure the outcome is a positive and enduring policy framework that will deliver the benefits of a flourishing air transport sector, while also meeting our environmental goals. In the meantime, there are many more immediate challenges to face - on safety and security, on improving the passenger experience, and on making the best use of existing capacity.

**Ash**

The most recent challenge we have faced has been the unwelcome eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano in Iceland. Our response this time was much more measured and effective than last year, and meant we could avoid the blanket closures of airspace that we saw twelve months ago. That does not mean we cannot do better next time. Together with better data on the height and concentration of ash, and a much improved understanding of the effect of ash on aircraft, we benefited from a much improved regulatory safety regime. This allowed airlines to fly in predicted concentrations of ash which last year would have seen airspace closed.

The urgent need now is to improve the quality of input data to the ash dispersion model. Using a feedback loop from the observed actual distribution and concentration of ash to reassess the interpretation of the at-source data in the modelling inputs. By improving the quality of input data to the model, we can expect progressively more accurate outputs and better informed decisions.  That is why I announced last week that I have asked the Government's Chief Scientist, Professor Sir John Beddington, to chair a Peer Review Group to work with the Met Office to establish how best to use the actual observation data to refine inputs to the model.

Improving the predictive accuracy of the model must be our top priority. But in the meantime, we need to widen the range of inputs the CAA uses in establishing red zones, where ash is forecast to be above the 4,000 microgram level, so they are not simply mechanical extrapolations of the dispersion model. So the CAA has established a Volcanic Ash Advisory Group, comprising representatives from the Met Office, NATS and airlines, working together to develop an improved methodology to analyse data from a range of sources to produce an accurate, real time, working picture of developing ash concentrations - which will inform the definition of the Red Zone in future events. I am confident this approach will further, significantly, reduce the impact of future ash events on aviation. We hope to reach a broad international agreement on this revised two-pronged approach quickly. Working together, we can satisfy the passenger's twin demand for safety and convenience, while avoiding the significant economic costs of airspace closures.

**Security**

The need for collaboration is not, of course, limited to unexpected events like volcanic eruptions. Routine issues of aviation security also remain an evolving challenge where we need a co-ordinated approach. And we are in the process of developing a new aviation security regulatory system where the Government concentrates on setting the security **outcomes **that need to be achieved, while freeing up operators to devise the **processes**needed to deliver them, within the constraints of EU requirements.

We will be consulting with the industry on this approach later this year, but, in the meantime, we are undertaking a limited 'call for evidence' exercise which aims to better understand the potential savings, costs and wider benefits of this new regulatory approach. I look forward to your contributions to this process. Meanwhile, we will continue to work in partnership internationally to tackle the ever-changing terror threat. Most recently, this has focussed on inbound cargo, where it was clear that weaknesses existed, had been identified by the enemy, and were very nearly successfully exploited.

I welcome the package of proposals around cargo security that the EU has put forward. I am disappointed that yesterday's vote failed to secure a majority in favour of this package. This is a clear example of where action at a European level will be in our National interest. We will continue to press for a pan-European approach on inbound cargo. But in the meantime, my officials will work with UK airlines to ensure that we have in place for the UK a system that is risk-based, proportionate and effective.

**Passenger experience / protection**

The safety and security of airline passengers must be the first priority of both Government and the industry, but we all recognise that the passenger experience goes far beyond this. And as customer expectations, and the industry itself, evolve, so too must the framework for the economic regulation of our main airports, which is now 25 years old. Our philosophy is clear: the change that is needed must be achieved not through micro-management by regulators, but by properly alignment of economic incentives. So in the next session of this Parliament, in the Spring of next year we will legislate for a new regime that will significantly enhance the quality of service that airlines and passengers receive - by aligning the operators' economic interest more closely with that of passengers, and the airlines who carry them.

The new framework we propose will encourage improvements, incentivise investment, focus on the needs of customers, and ensure that passenger benefits are delivered with the minimum of regulatory interference. Ensuring that London's airports give a positive first impression of the UK to arriving visitors, and leave the right image in departing passengers' minds. Meanwhile, our South East Airports Taskforce - which is looking at ways to make the best use of existing airport infrastructure - will report in July, and I am grateful to everyone in the industry for their commitment and input to that process.

Equally important to passengers is ensuring that we deliver the right kind of protection when things do, occasionally, go wrong. That means greater resilience at airports - which we will achieve through the reformed economic regime. And modernisation of the current outdated ATOL scheme, which was poorly understood by passengers. We will be launching our consultation on ATOL reform shortly. And at the European level, I welcome the fact that the Commission intends to look again at regulation EC 261.

I think we would all agree that the establishment of common rules on compensation and welfare support for passengers was an important step forward. But I am equally clear in my own mind that there is no such thing as a free lunch - and with the cost of flying lower than ever before, I am unconvinced that generous, fixed-sum passenger compensation, which bears no relation to ticket price, can really be in the long-term best interest of passengers or a diverse and competitive industry. I shall be continuing to urge the Commission to find a way forward that is fair to passengers, simple to operate, and easy to understand. As well as being in line with our goal of a strong, prosperous and competitive aviation sector.

**Conclusion**

So in the coming months, there will be much for us to discuss as we work to map out a sustainable growth strategy for aviation in the UK - while dealing with some of the more immediately pressing issues along the way. There will be further challenges, and, doubtless, further disagreements, ahead - no doubt about that. I have come to appreciate the forthrightness with which your industry's more colourful characters like to express their views. But I have also learned that this is a resourceful, innovative, flexible, and fast responding industry - able to deal with a difficult and fast moving environment. I repeat my desire - the Government's desire - to see the aviation sector prosper, and our determination to work with you to make sure that can happen, while delivering our environmental goals. I can promise you that I will engage with you with an open mind and an open door, as we work through the key policy challenges in the months ahead. And I am confident that, by working together, we can build a strong and prosperous future for this vitally important national industry.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20110628,National Rail Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Introduction

Thank you. It's a pleasure to be with all of you again today.

It is almost exactly a year since I made my first major rail speech as Transport Secretary here at the 2010 National Rail Conference.

And I'd like to thank Nigel and the team at Rail magazine for all the support - and constructive criticism - they've given me over the intervening year. And for the platform you have provided for the debate on the big issues facing the industry.

We have a bold, and, to some, controversial agenda on [High Speed Rail](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/high-speed-rail/) and it's enormously important that the issues can be debated - as they are, with both sides' views getting an airing, in Rail Magazine.

And we have a huge challenge in securing the sustainability of the railway for the future.

Reading Rail magazine last week, Nigel, I have to say that I'm impressed with the range of your sources.

But surprised by some of the analysis.

In particular, I have been taken aback that any sign of dynamism in the implementation agenda - a willingness to respond to events in a changing situation - is immediately interpreted as a sign of lack of direction.

Where I come from, success depends on having a crystal-clear and unwavering view of the strategy, but a willingness and ability to be agile and tactical in implementing it.

And that is how I intend to work in my Department.

Civil servants might not welcome the idea, but I believe I am the best person to spell out my plans for the rail industry, and what I am trying to achieve.

And to deal head-on with any suggestion that the Department's thinking on rail reform is in any way unclear.

Or that it is lacking in commitment to delivering that reform.

So that is what I want to do this afternoon.

Of course, with a new(ish) Ministerial team with some very different ideas from its predecessor, there is bound to be some jockeying as officials probe and test and challenge the views of Ministers - to ensure their robustness and consistency and fitness for purpose.

I value that process and would expect no less. After all, it is just possible they may have found, in the past, that not all politicians' ideas are robust, consistent and fit for purpose.

In my private sector past, I have never worked with ""yes"" people, and in my public sector present, I don't want to work with ""yes Minister"" people!

We are clear as a Department where we are going and what our purpose is.

And we are clear too, that what we are advocating is not a revolution. But it will be a fast evolution.

## Clarity of vision

I want to have a robust debate about how best to deliver the agenda.

About the tactics.

But not about the agenda itself - the strategy.

We have made clear our vision:

A transport system that is an engine for economic growth; is cleaner and greener and improves the quality of life in our communities.

A system in which rail has a key role to play.

With a safe, customer-focused, rail system that supports a growing economy, by improving capacity, connectivity, performance, and productivity.

Contributing to our wider climate change objectives, by reducing transport's carbon emissions, and encouraging modal shift from road and aviation.

And delivering value for the farepayer, the freight customer, and the taxpayer - as well as playing its part in reducing the deficit.

That vision will drive everything we do in the months and years ahead.

Philip Haigh was right to note last week that we face a bulging in-tray:

Winning the argument on HS2; responding to McNulty, and developing our wider agenda for a sustainable railway; constructing the next HLOS; the transformation of Network Rail - and, of course, reletting the raft of franchises up for renewal, under the new franchise approach.

And meeting all these challenges while transforming the style with which the railway is managed.

More collaboration, and less confrontation.

A change to long-term thinking, more accountability and less micromanagement.

And crucially, more strategic leadership from the industry as a whole in reducing costs, and improving productivity - with less interference from Whitehall.

We are not afraid of hard work. But, given the scale of the challenges, this cannot be just a vision for Government; it is one that must be embraced by the entire rail industry.

## Cost/McNulty

Because there is a burning platform - and it is this, uncomfortable, truth: despite the impressive growth, and the improvements in safety and reliability that we have seen in recent years, there is a less welcome fact - the huge rise and unsustainable rise in the cost of running the railways.

For far too long, the railway has relied on ever-increasing public subsidies the on one hand, and ever-rising rail fares on the other.

It was glaringly obvious to me from the outset that our railways were costing too much to run. And now [Sir Roy McNulty's report](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/realising-the-potential-of-gb-rail) has confirmed it.

And put some numbers on the scale of the challenge.

A railway up to 40% more expensive per passenger mile than our European competitors, which Sir Roy has generously interpreted to mean that costs are between 20% and 30% higher than they should be.

This isn't just hurting passengers, freight operators, and the public purse; it is hurting your industry, and Britain's economy.

So it needs to be addressed now.

The challenge of building a sustainable and competitive railway cannot be delayed a moment longer.

## Franchising

We had already announced our intention, even before Sir Roy's recommendation, to award longer [franchises](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/rail-passenger-franchises/) to stimulate investment and risk taking by operators, with less specification at the outset and less micromanagement and interference from Government thereafter.

And we will deliver these changes. But we said something else, even more important, that appears to have received less attention: that all franchises are not equal. West Coast Main Line is not Greater Anglia; Northern is not C2C.

So we will tailor the solutions to the individual franchises: more radical solutions for some; less radical for others. Horses for courses. And if the first one or two that come up are more suitable for modest innovation, that does not mean we have given up on the radical agenda or ""U-turned"", or been beaten back by the ""forces of reaction"" that some detect in the Department. It just means we are pragmatic, not dogmatic, in our approach. Recognising that one size will not fit all.

I fully recognise that, with a large number of franchise renewals due over the next few years, customising the reforms to each franchise represents a huge programme of work - both for my Department and the industry.

But there should be no doubt about our determination to deliver on this agenda. Or our commitment to deploy the resources that are needed to do it.

The draft specification for the West Coast franchise, which I published last month, does not represent a revolution. The West Coast is too complicated a piece of railway to be a ""first adopter"" of a more radical iteration of the new franchise model. But it does represent a significant relaxation from the rigid timetable and service specifications of the past.

We retain obligations that protect the key elements of service, such as principal first and last train services and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day.

But the greater flexibility to organise services and calling patterns, and to respond to peaks and troughs of passenger demand, marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has prevented operators from maximising capacity and reacting to the changing needs of their customers.

And replacing the ""cap and collar"" revenue support system with a GDP risk-sharing arrangement will cushion train operators against changes in the economy that are beyond their control, without the perverse incentives of the current system. I want to see every train operator incentivised to chase the ticket-money of the marginal customer wherever the system has spare capacity to accommodate him.

I recognise that this new approach to franchises represents a major culture shift in Government. And it is a mark of our commitment to openness and transparency that we are consulting fully on the revised draft service requirement that we published last month.

We will build on these changes in future franchise competitions, giving operators greater flexibility to meet passenger demand and to innovate, while protecting key service outcomes on which passengers rely.

To succeed in this endeavour, we need to be working with partners who understand the commercial benefits of collaboration - and the necessity of driving out excess costs.

So, as a matter of policy for all future franchise competitions, bidders and their parent groups will be assessed at the prequalification stage against their track record of success in collaborative working and driving down costs.

In our future world of long-term franchises, there will be no room for short-term players.

The commitment by Government to invest in the railway must be matched by an equally firm commitment on the part of the industry to long-term cost reduction and efficiency improvements.

I expect to see the industry -Network Rail, train companies, unions, suppliers, the regulator - demonstrating that they have the ability and appetite to offer their own solutions in place of a centrally-imposed one from my Department.

In particular, train operators and Network Rail must collaborate more effectively to build on Network Rail's decision to devolve managerial responsibility to route directors.

And Network Rail must re-invent its relationships with its supply chain. Driving efficiency and aligning interests at every level.

The need for a new culture of partnership working in the rail industry - with a long-term focus and an unequivocal emphasis on cost reduction - is not an option.

It's an obligation.

I am pleased that the industry has already accepted Sir Roy's recommendation to form a Rail Delivery Group, to focus industry leadership and act as a powerful co-ordinating force.

And I am particularly looking forward to the industry's initial plan for PR 13, which must reflect this new collaboration and the urgent need to tackle costs.

## Next steps/wider strategy paper

Over the next few months, we will consider carefully the detailed recommendations that Sir Roy has directed at the Government.

But Sir Roy deliberately confined himself to the narrow question of value for money.

I am clear that, if we are to secure an affordable, sustainable, safe and reliable railway, we need to look beyond the scope of his report, to the wider questions of the purpose and objectives of our railway, and the structure, governance, and organisation that will best deliver them.

So in parallel with our response to McNulty, we will develop, over the next few months, a strategy that sets out our wider plan for building a sustainable railway.

This strategy will have at its core the task of delivering better value for passengers and taxpayers, and will clearly set out the roles of central and local Government, Network Rail, train operators and others in delivering the outcomes we require.

It will look at how we can devolve more responsibility for commissioning local and regional services from the centre to local bodies - where there is greater accountability to local communities and passengers, and a better understanding about the local consequences of the decisions they take.

And it will ask the hard questions about taxpayer subsidy: how much we can afford; how it should be delivered and what, exactly, are we buying with it?

We can only deliver a better value railway if we can see where money is being well spent - and where it is being wasted. So we need a much more open and transparent view of the whole industry's finances - and not just those of Network Rail. It is proper to use subsidy to buy desirable outcomes the market would never deliver; it is never proper to use it to mask waste and inefficiency.

In its most recent business plan, my Department has made a firm commitment to greater transparency. We have published information on our website about where rail subsidy is allocated, on a franchise-by-franchise basis - both in terms of direct TOC funding from the Government and network grant payments made to Network Rail.

Later this year we will go further, publishing high level information on whole industry costs.

I would like all passengers to know in due course the cost of the specific services they are using and the percentage their fares are contributing to them.

## Fares review

It fell to me to make the decision to increase fares by 3% above RPI for 3 years to protect rail investment in the face of the fiscal crisis.

It was not a decision I took lightly.

And I sympathise with passengers' concerns that fares are, quite simply, too expensive.

But I am equally conscious that we must do more to address the shortcomings of a pricing system that many find complex and confusing.

Buying a train ticket should not be an obstacle course.

And it is clear we cannot build a modern, customer-focused rail service without a passenger-friendly approach to fares structure and regulation.

But we also have to be realistic.

Anyone who has tried to board the 7pm service from Euston to Manchester on a Friday evening will know that there are compelling reasons for moving to a more flexible and responsive fare system that spreads demand more efficiently throughout the day.

So over the coming months we will conduct the review of fares policy recommended by Sir Roy, as a first step towards a simpler, fairer and more effective system.

And if we succeed in delivering cost savings on the scale envisaged by Sir Roy, we will also be able to put the era of above-inflation fare rises behind us, as well as reducing taxpayer subsidy, thus creating the opportunity for even greater passenger growth in the future.

## Delivering on promises

Twelve months ago, I stood here and declared myself a railway realist.

But I also promised that rail would be at the forefront of the Government's transport strategy - contributing to the Coalition's twin goals of economic growth and carbon reduction.

And after a demanding but productive twelve months, I believe I have kept that promise.

A spending review settlement that far exceeded expectations has allowed us to deliver a very significant programme of investment in our classic rail network.

We've announced a substantial electrification programme, given the go-ahead to Crossrail and Thameslink, and confirmed the purchase of over 2,000 new rail vehicles. As well as restoring train-building to the industry's birthplace in the North East through the IEP programme and a host more of more minor but important investments like Swindon to Kemble redoubling and the Ordsall Curve.

And in February we launched a consultation on our plans for a high speed rail network, that I believe can transform Britain's economic geography, help us close the North-South gap and send a clear message that we are determined to embrace the future and fight our corner in a globalising economy.

## **Conclusion**

Building a new high speed rail line is among the biggest challenges any Transport Secretary will ever have faced.

But driving cost out of our existing railway, so that it is sustainable, competitive and affordable for future generations, is no less of a priority.

I don't expect either to win me short-term popularity - even with all of the trade press!

But there's no doubt in my mind that both are necessary and right - for the rail industry, our economy, and our country as a whole.

So we have a clear choice.

We can work together towards a truly sustainable railway of the future, where all the players in the industry are committed to real change.

Or we can choose the route back to the past, where unsustainable practices, dependent on unaffordable public subsidy, lead, sadly, but inevitably, to a smaller railway and fewer services.

In the Coalition, we have made our choice, with our dual commitment to investment and reform.

Now it is up to you, the industry, to back it - with a clear commitment to focused collaboration for lasting change.

So let's work together to seize this opportunity - and build a railway that is truly fit for the 21st century.

And make my prediction last year of a new ""Golden Age of Rail"" an affordable reality.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20110718,Speech at Office of Rail Regulation PR13 launch,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Thank you for that introduction.

It's now almost four years since David Cameron moved me from the treasury to the transport brief. Short by comparison with the timescales associated with most normal jobs... four years amounts to a remarkable degree of continuity given the average life span of transport front benchers.And back in 2007, the first task I faced in my new role was to respond to Ruth Kelly's HLOS and Sofa statement for the current railway control period.So I'm delighted to be able to take part in this important opportunity to reflect on the priorities for PR13 and the CP5 control period.

The Periodic Review process is a vital component of the wide-ranging debate about the future of the railways we must have if we are to deliver the cost savings needed to give a better deal to both taxpayers and farepayers.With its forensic focus on the big issues confronting the industry PR13 is an important mechanism for delivering real and lasting change in our railways.It's clear that delivering the change we need will mean that all elements of the rail industry have to be ready to adapt and evolve.

But it's equally clear that the Government too must play its part. Helping to map out a post 2014 future through the development of the next HLOS** and SoFA **is an important step.

But so too is setting out a transport vision that is credible and deliverable. The Coalition Government wants a transport system that is a cleaner, greener **gateway to a better quality of life...**

... one that **generates growth, spreads prosperity and empowers local communities. We see rail playing a crucial part in delivering that goal.

## Investing in Britain by investing in rail

In testing times like these we could have opted to do what governments usually do when spending needs to be reined in - take the axe to transport projects

We chose a different path. In spite of intense pressure on the public finances from a deficit as bad as any in this nation's peacetime history the CSR saw funding secured for what is probably the biggest programme of rail upgrades since the Victorian era.

These include a green-light for Crossrail, Thameslink and the HLOS programme of additional carriages for our most crowded lines. The IEP Programme is going ahead, alongside electrification in the North West and to South Wales.

Light rail extensions have been confirmed in Newcastle and Manchester and funding's been secured for the much-needed tube upgrades... Swindon - Kemble redoubling finally got the go ahead too, despite not quite making it on to the ORR's list last time round.

And the Ordsall Curve has now been added to the programme which will deliver major improvements to the rail connections in the north of England. Add to that list, a milestone consultation on our plans for a high speed rail network that could permanently transform our economic geography and you have an idea of the scale of what we have embarked on. These are some of the ways the Coalition is investing in Britain by investing in rail.

## Value for Money/McNulty

And there's no doubt that the years since privatisation have seen a railway renaissance with better services, improvements in safety and reliability and, most strikingly of all, massive growth in passenger numbers. More people are travelling by train in this country than at any time since the 1920s. But we also need to confront an inconvenient truth.

With that success in recent years has come a creeping reliance on ever-increasing public subsidy and ever-rising fares.

End result: this country's railways are among the most expensive in Europe - expensive to build, expensive to operate and expensive to use.

Even after allowing for unavoidable differences... the McNulty Report concluded that UK rail costs are 20-30% higher than they should be.

Little wonder that Sir Roy concluded there was immense scope to eliminate waste and reduce costs **without** the need to cut services.

## A part to play, a difference to make

So there's a simple rail equation to strive for - efficient and affordable equals successful and sustainable. That's what tomorrow's railways must look like, and we all have a part to play and a difference to make in ensuring that they do. If we are to achieve this goal it is vital that there is a strong cross-industry focus on getting costs down.

That needs to include a resolute and determined approach to reforming working practices and addressing industrial relations issues. These are essential building blocks for delivering the savings we need.

It's now widely agreed that we need a much greater alignment of incentives between train operators and Network Rail to reduce costs at the route level.We therefore welcome the ORR's emphasis on this issue in their PR13 consultation proposals. We also welcome Network Rail's commitment to devolve responsibility and accountability down to the route level.

Decentralisation, localism, devolution. This approach is at the heart of the Government's overall policy approach - and the transport sector is no exception. Under previous government s more and more decisions about our railways were centralised in Whitehall.

Well we want to see an end to those days of excessive micro-management and we have already made a start on that with our programme of franchise reform. Transparency also has a vital contribution to make and the ORR are in a strong position to lead on providing a more open and transparent view of the industry's finances.We have a far better chance of delivering better value for money if we have a clearer picture of where money is being** well** spent, and where it's not.

In its most recent business plan, the DfT has therefore made a commitment to greater transparency. We have published information on our website about where rail subsidy is allocated, on a franchise-by-franchise basis.This includes Government funding support given to train operators as well as to Network Rail through track access charges.

Later this year we plan to go further by publishing high level information on whole industry costs.In due course, we want passengers to have a much better understanding of the cost of the specific services they are using and the percentage their fares are contributing to them.

## Franchise Reform, Fares Review Rail, Strategy Paper

None of us here can walk away from the immense task facing the rail industry over the next few years. In particular, the Government has a responsibility to construct a supportive policy framework. So we are reforming rail franchising to give operators greater flexibility to respond to passenger demand.

And over the coming months, we will conduct the review of fares policy recommended in the McNulty Report. Our aspiration is a more rational and efficient system - one that seeks to address the anomalies which have crept in and also tackles the sort of 'cliff edge' problems which have sometimes led to perverse results and intensified crowding problems.

We also want to deliver a fairer, more transparent and more user-friendly system. I believe that the McNulty Report was a watershed moment for the rail industry.

But Sir Roy deliberately confined himself to the narrow question of value for money.If we're to secure a successful and sustainable future for rail, we need to look beyond the scope of the report, to the broader questions of the purpose and objectives of our railway... and to the governance and organisation that will best deliver them.

For that reason, over the next few months we will be preparing a strategy that sets out our wider plans. It will look at how we deliver better outcomes for passengers, including value for money. But we will also seek to set out more clearly the roles of central and local Government, Network Rail, train operators and others in delivering the outcomes we require. And it will ask the hard questions about taxpayer subsidy. How much we can afford? How should it be delivered? And what do taxpayers get for their hard-earned investment?

## Conclusion

Ladies and gentlemen, the task we face is fraught with difficulty. It will require a huge effort from both industry and Government to deliver the cost savings we need. But, as the PR13 consultation acknowledges, this is also a time of opportunity for all of us who care about Britain's railways. An opportunity to build a better future for our rail network...

An opportunity to deliver a successful and sustainable future for an industry that is vital to our national well-being - socially, economically and environmentally. And, perhaps most important off all, an opportunity to deliver better value for money to the hard-pressed passenger and to put the era of above inflation fare rises behind us.

I believe that's a prize worth striving for.

Thank you.

Thank you David,

And thank you ladies and gentlemen. It's a great pleasure to join you today.

When the Coalition was formed last May, we knew we faced perhaps the toughest and most challenging agenda of any government in modern British history.

But from day one, we were absolutely clear about our priorities:

Tackling, first and foremost, the record budget deficit we inherited from our predecessors

And rebuilding and rebalancing our economy, after a decade of lopsided growth, followed by one of the longest and deepest recessions in our history.

We are now working to put Britain back on the path towards sustainable growth and prosperity, while delivering on our commitment to carbon reduction.

We have set out a clear and credible plan to eradicate the structural current deficit during this Parliament and get debt falling as a percentage of GDP. We are clear that this is the right course for Britain, and we will stick to it.

Our economy, while delivering deficit reduction measures, has, in the first six months of this year, outperformed the US economy - despite Obama's massive fiscal stimulus package.

Our market interest rates have fallen, while other countries' have soared; our credit rating is secure while others' have faltered; and Britain, despite the choppy recovery that was always predicted, is being hailed as a safe haven in a global economic storm.

But of course there is more still to do.

Despite the tough global economic climate, we must continue to build on the foundations that sound public finances provide to secure the growth, the jobs, and the private sector investment that will drive our prosperity in the coming years.

## Transport key to growth

Infrastructure investment - and transport infrastructure in particular - is a key part of our plans to drive economic recovery. It provides not just welcome demand stimulus in the short term, but a vital improvement in productivity over the long-term.

Modern transport networks are the arteries of commerce, moving people to the workplace and goods to the marketplace. They connect communities, support businesses and enhance social mobility.

And as we modernise our infrastructure, and encourage more sustainable forms of travel, transport can help us cut carbon emissions, improve air quality, and offer a cleaner, greener gateway to a better quality of life.

That is why transport emerged as a major winner in last year's Spending Review.

Despite a tough public spending climate, £30 billion of capital funding was announced over the spending review period - more than was invested in the previous four years.

Our commitment to transport means we can invest in ambitious national infrastructure projects like high speed rail, that can help transform our economic geography and spread prosperity right across the country.

But we also recognise that, if we are to unleash the growth potential of our regions and to get maximum value from our strategic infrastructure investments, we cannot afford to neglect the local transport networks that connect to them.

And we should never forget that the vast majority of journeys Britons take are under five miles.

## Transport and localism

Or that many of the most important transport issues are local in nature. Sometimes **very** local.

Roadworks. Local road congestion. Reliability of bus services.

Local issues that are understood by local people.

And local transport problems that are best solved by local people.

The best-value transport investments are often in smaller-scale projects - ones that help tackle congestion, and improve connectivity, road safety, and accessibility.

Yet for far too long in this country, important decisions about local transport have been taken, and monitored, centrally - by Ministers and civil servants sitting in Whitehall, ticking boxes and second guessing.

For years, the top down, ""Whitehall knows best"" approach has perpetuated a system that is not only bureaucratic and inefficient, but which also hampers local enterprise and competition.

So it is time for reform.

And for the Coalition, that preferred reform is localism.

To give local communities and businesses real control over their own destiny.

To unlock the growth potential of our cities.

To support economic regeneration from the ground up.

And to move towards a more transparent, accountable and responsive way of designing and providing public services.

## Progress so far

You have already heard today from Greg Clark about the significant progress we've made in re-designing the old top-down structure of delivery.

Whitehall has been slimmed down. Quangos have gone. Government Offices for the Regions have closed their doors.

In their place we have announced a massive transfer of power to councils, communities, and individuals.

The Localism Bill should receive Royal Assent at the end of this year, and many more reforms will follow.

And I, for my part, am determined to place the local role in the delivery of transport projects centre stage.

In rail, for example, we are exploring how we can devolve more responsibility and budgets for commissioning local and regional services away from the centre to more local bodies - where there is greater accountability to local communities and passengers, and a better understanding about the local consequences of the decisions they take.

And in local transport, we have radically overhauled the way grant funding is delivered - to get the best results for communities, and the best value for taxpayers.

We have already slashed the number of separate local transport grant streams from 26 to just four, giving local authorities much greater flexibility and freedom to decide their own priorities.

### Next steps to localism

But I want to go further. I want to explore how we can devolve the capital funding for local major transport schemes - those with a value greater than...

These transport projects are not just key to economic growth - they are also essential to our decentralisation strategy.

Previously they were managed through Labour's Regional Funding Allocation process, which had a veneer of decentralisation, but little of real substance.

Initial decisions were taken by unelected and unaccountable regional bodies.

And their role was purely advisory. Central Government remained the ultimate decision-maker.

Now the regional tier of Government is being dismantled, we have the opportunity to develop a fresh, and genuinely decentralised, approach that is fit for the future.

One that genuinely shifts power away from the centre, to allow the businesses and communities who depend on transport infrastructure, to shape it, making decisions accountable at the sub-national level, and responsive to local economic conditions.

Any change we make will be effective for the next round of local authority major schemes funding, covering the period 2015-2018.

But local major transport schemes can take around four years to move from business case to the start of construction. That means, if we are to maximise the potential of decentralisation to kick-start sub-national and local economic growth, we must act now to put these new freedoms in place.

And because some of the local authority major schemes are indeed 'major', sometimes £100m plus, any formula-distributed grant needs to flow in a way that ensures that even the largest projects could get funded over a number of years. That means that, in most cases, distribution by formula to a single LEP or local authority would not deliver the desired result. A larger effective unit, reflecting real economic and transport geographies, but 'chunky' enough to deliver worthwhile sums of capital through the formula, has to be devised.

So today I am announcing my intention to launch a consultation on what that structure might look like - on how we can fully devolve decisions and funding for local capital transport improvements to a number of, what I will call for shorthand, ""Local Transport Consortia"", each made up of a number of LEPs and their constituent local authorities.

Such an approach, if correctly designed, will ensure more local decision making...

... without losing the essential focus on the strategic needs of a sub-national economy.

Allowing focus on decisions that place higher weight on local priorities and needs, while maintaining the focus on generating maximum economic growth.

And saving a huge amount of time and effort that was previously wasted at the interface between local project promoters and Whitehall.

Local Enterprise Partnerships, designed around functional economic geographies, are an obvious starting point. But the Consortia, like the LEPs themselves, must be 'bottom up' creations.

And the scale, geography and structure must be right for local circumstances: we do not have to adopt a standardised approach.

LEPs are uniquely placed to contribute to strategic decisions which best align transport investment with growth potential, while local authorities can bring significant transport expertise - and local accountability - to the table.

A successful Local Transport Consortium must be able to integrate major scheme transport investment with wider plans for growth, including planning, housing, skills and training, enterprise, health and the environment.

In some areas, this will mean building on existing arrangements, while others will wish to explore opportunities with new partners.

The consultation will invite thoughts on the structure, optimum size, configuration, governance and accountability arrangements that would be most appropriate to ensure the proper use of public money and the delivery of value for money, while achieving genuine local ownership of the prioritisation and delivery of sub-national transport investment projects.

## Challenges

Of course, there will be challenges. The purpose of the consultation will be to explore the different options and establish a consensus on the best way to take this agenda forward.

The decisions that consortia make must be seen to be transparent and scrupulously fair if they are to win the confidence of local people.

And there are other, wider challenges that cut across the Government's localism agenda.

None more pivotal than accountability.

As Ministers, we rightly expect to be held accountable for the delivery of a national agenda by the electorate.

With power and responsibility should come accountability.

As we progress with decentralisation, we recognise that there will be some tension between seeking to encourage genuinely devolved decision-making and an ingrained instinct on the part of the electorate to hold Ministers accountable for all but the most local spending decisions.

But we will get nowhere unless we are prepared to meet this challenge head-on.

So Local Transport Consortia will need to be able to put in place measures that demonstrate accountability; proper financial management and propriety; an ability to deal with cost overruns and delays to schemes; and a commitment to delivering value for money.

Rather than civil servants spending hours monitoring and appraising individual schemes, the role of central Government should be to ensure that Local Transport Consortia are ready, and able, to maximise value for money and to make decisions which best support the economy and promote sustainable development. And that arrangements are in place for them to be held accountable by the communities and businesses they serve.

Some consortia may progress more quickly than others. Some may be able to 'go it alone' with the management and delivery of budgets and projects straight away.

Others may prefer to walk first, with a shared approach to project appraisal and prioritisation, to make sure schemes are based on robust evidence, and meet sub national and local growth priorities.

While I am clear that my Department's long-term role does not lie in individual scheme appraisal or management of delivery, we will be ready to adopt a flexible approach to the transition, if that is what Local Transport Consortia wish.

So while we will play a light-touch role with local partners - and, let me assure you, that role will be as light as I can possibly make it - we will also be there to help you find effective working solutions to whatever challenge you face.

We will work closely with Local Transport Consortia so each is able to adapt to the changes - ensuring the end result is a decentralised decision-making system that genuinely unleashes local growth.

## Conclusion

So as soon as Parliament reconvenes after the Party Conferences, I will launch a 3-month consultation to seek your views on these proposals and the best way to proceed with them.

I hope as many of you as possible will take part.

This will be a learning process- no doubt about it.

That is inevitable when we're transforming the way local infrastructure is planned, funded and built.

The experience of previous governments has taught us that real, meaningful localism is easier to talk about than deliver.

But when this Government talks about localism, we mean it.

For us, localism isn't an essentially centralised decision making structure dressed up in a localist wrapper.

Real localism, genuine localism, means a culture change across central and local government, to drive a radical shift in power away from Whitehall, and into the hands of local people, local businesses and local communities.

It requires local authorities, LEPs, businesses and communities to work together in partnership - and be prepared to accept compromise and necessary trade-offs to unlock barriers to growth.

In relation to capital projects, it will require a high degree of political maturity to pursue sub-national priorities: this process will not succeed if capital funds are divided into penny packets for each constituent part.

And it requires a local commitment to transparency and accountability, to engender trust and confidence.

Together, we will meet these challenges.

And I'm convinced that we will emerge with a robust model of decentralisation that will transform local transport delivery for good.

That way, we can deliver the world-class networks that will set Britain back on the path to sustainable growth and lasting prosperity.

Thank you, and I look forward to working with you to take this agenda forward.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-20110921,Building a sustainable future,"Speech by the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests.
Today I want to talk to you about how we go about building a sustainable future.

The case I'm going to make has three core arguments: The first is that ""sustainability"" must be defined in its widest sense; a policy will only, in practice, be sustainable if it supports our environmental and economic goals.

The second is that while there may sometimes be a tension, there is not necessarily conflict between these two crucially important objectives - it is possible to achieve both in tandem. And the third is that, along with power generation, transport has an absolutely pivotal role in delivering that sustainable future.

## Paying tribute to Japan's unbreakable spirit

Before I go on to make those arguments, I'd like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan back in March.

Like everyone in Britain, I was shocked and saddened by the destruction and the tragic loss of life caused by that terrible event.

But I have also been deeply impressed, by the resilience of the Japanese people and their almost super-human efforts to recover from the effects of the disaster.

The work you have done, the progress you have made and the determination you have shown is hugely impressive and, on behalf of my Government and my country, I want to pay tribute to Japan's unbreakable spirit.

## Global challenges - environmental & economic

The earthquake and tsunami were, of course, natural disasters. So, while we can always prepare for events like these, we will never be able to prevent them, or stop them in their tracks. The same cannot be said of climate change. Climate change threatens our planet and imperils our future. That's not science fiction, it's science fact.

But this is a man-made problem - which means that it is possible for us to do something about it. Individually as countries, and collectively as an international community, it is within our power to tackle climate change.

So, in order to build a sustainable future it is imperative that we meet this global challenge. But Japan, Britain, all of the mature economies, face a second global challenge - the challenge of maintaining economic growth.

The earthquake and tsunami took a heart-breaking toll in human lives. But they have also hit Japan's economy - from a recovery bill totalling trillions of Yen, to the inevitable downward pressure on national GDP as output dropped.

And, because Japan is one of the biggest economies in our increasingly inter-connected world, there has been an inevitable knock-on effect for the entire global economy.

On its own, the global economic consequences of what happened in March would have been serious and significant. But they were also part of an unprecedented coincidence of international events.

The past year has witnessed the euro-zone debt crisis, the downgrading of America's credit rating and rocketing commodity prices in everything from food and oil, to copper and gold - as well as the tsunami and earthquake.

Together, their impact has been magnified beyond the sum of their parts. In effect they have conspired to grind-down confidence and whip-up uncertainty in the financial markets.

End result - right around the world the conditions for generating growth have become much, much tougher. And, just as it is vital that countries reduce their deficits and live within their means, so it is crucial that we grow our economies. That's the only way to secure the recovery, put people back to work and spread prosperity.

So, if we want that sustainable future, not only must we commit ourselves to the fight against climate change, we must also commit ourselves to delivering economic growth.

I am clear that those objectives do not need to be incompatible. There does not have to be a choice between safeguarding the environment and generating economic growth. This is not a zero sum game.

And one of the key areas where we will see this truth demonstrated is in transport. When the Coalition Government came to power in Britain last May, we inherited a deficit greater than any in our nation's peacetime history.

No individual, no family, no business can carry on spending more than they earn indefinitely. There will always come a day of reckoning when the credit card bill lands on the doormat and you either pay off the debt or go bust. The recent upheaval in the global financial markets reminds us that, ultimately, the same goes for governments.

So, from day one in office, our Government was clear that our number one priority was - and is - restoring Britain's public finances to order.

Traditionally, British Governments have responded to fiscal pressure by slashing capital investment - avoiding the politically challenging cuts in current spending.

But not this time. In spite of intense pressure on budgets, we made the choice to invest in infrastructure, and transport infrastructure in particular. And for good reason.

We know that transport investment is a key economic driver - strengthening the arteries of commerce, moving people to the workplace and goods to the marketplace.

In the short term, transport investment supports job creation through the development, manufacture and application of new technologies and the construction and maintenance of infrastructure across the sector.

And in the longer term, it drives the productivity growth which is the key to future competitiveness.

But this investment will also be a key part of our plan to make Britain cleaner and greener. Economic growth and decarbonisation. Being delivered hand in hand across the transport sector. Let me take you through some of the steps we have taken in pursuit of our double-headed goal of sustainable economic growth.

## Sparking a green motoring revolution

For a few years, UK government policy, focussed on the need to tackle climate change, drifted into what appeared to be an unthinking hostility to cars and motoring.

But a ""war on the motorist"" is not sustainable. Motorists are voters, and a sustainable policy, in a democracy, must be a policy that voters will support. So our Government recognises the absolute centrality of the car to people's lives.

For many journeys it is, and will remain, the only practical and convenient choice. Indeed, 84% of all journeys in the UK are undertaken by car.

The enemy is not the car, it's the carbon. So, in Britain we have ended the war on the motorist and are prosecuting the war on carbon - sparking a green revolution in motoring with a blend of supportive public policy and dynamic private enterprise.

And I'm pleased to say that Japanese investment and Japanese companies are playing a central role by committing early and clearly to our ""Plug-In Car Grant"" which gives consumers a 25% subsidy, up to  £5,000, if they buy an ultra-low emission car.

Alongside this new grant is our ""Plugged-In-Places"" Programme, designed to meet the infrastructure needs of electric car drivers, setting up a targeted network of electric vehicle recharging points around the country - everywhere from streets, to car parks, to retail and leisure facilities.

And we're using it to understand how the infrastructure to support electric vehicles needs to develop. That will differ from country to country - depending on culture, travel and work patterns and existing infrastructure.

For us, in Britain, on-street re-charging is certainly part of the answer. But we have concluded that putting a charge-point on every street corner is not the right approach.

Many drivers, perhaps most, will find it better suits their daily routine to plug-in at home, at night-time when electricity is cheaper, or while they're at work.

And we are reforming planning controls to make it easier for private enterprise to play its part.

By committing to this programme, we have ensured that the UK has been and is an attractive launch market for ultra-low emission vehicles and an attractive location for major private sector companies to build these new products for the European market.

Nissan is leading the way by constructing a plant to manufacture its electric vehicles and batteries in the North East of England. Others will follow and the supply chain and supporting technology development companies are already moving in.

A truly sustainable approach, promoting the change that will deliver our environmental objectives - while creating high quality jobs, regenerating our regions and rebalancing our economy.

Of course, reduced emissions from private cars can be mandated by regulation - but must ultimately be delivered by the private sector. Our Government also believes it's important to support more environmentally friendly forms of public transport - an area where we have more direct levers to influence behaviour. For example, in promoting low carbon buses.

These use at least 30 per cent less fuel and emit nearly a third less carbon than a conventional bus. Yet, when my Government came to office, they made up just 0.2 per cent of the country's bus fleet. So, we have invested in a multi-million pound Green Bus Fund which will kick-start the market by helping operators with the up-front cost of buying low carbon buses - as well as maintaining ongoing enhanced subsidy for green bus operation.

We estimate that, by March next year, this will result in more than 500 new hybrid and electric low carbon buses being on the roads - meaning that public transport will be making a contribution to shrinking the carbon footprint of road transport, just as the private sector is beginning to do.

The railways are another essential part of Britain's public transport networks. And they offer carbon reduction possibilities in everything from regenerative braking to trackside energy storage. Making existing rail journeys more carbon efficient, and attracting more and more passengers from other, less carbon-efficient, modes.

One important way that our Government is tapping into this potential is through a major programme of rail electrification.

Electric trains emit no air pollution at the trackside and they generate less CO2 than their diesel counterparts. So electrification of the railway - going hand in hand with de-carbonisation of the power generation sector, makes good environmental sense.

But investing in electrification makes good business sense too.
And that's because electric trains are much more reliable than diesels, they are cheaper to operate and often cheaper to buy, they require less maintenance and have lower energy costs and they are also lighter and so cause less damage to the track.

Carbon reduction - and greater efficiency. Environmental and economic benefits, hand in hand.

And as part of that electrification programme, we have given the go ahead for the £4.5 billion Inter-city express programme - which will mean new trains, more capacity and better reliability for passengers using some of Britain's busiest rail routes. And, again, a Japanese company, Hitachi, is helping us to deliver this project as part of a consortium with the British infrastructure company John Laing. With Hitachi building a new train factory in a high unemployment area of Britain and creating 600 jobs, here is another example of transport investment providing an economic shot in the arm, as well as delivering the goods for passengers and for the environment.

## High speed rail

Here in Japan, you will also know the potential of high speed rail networks to attract passengers on to trains and away from more environmentally damaging forms of travel, such as long-distance driving and short-haul flying.

What's more, you will understand the way that high speed rail can transform a nation's social and economic geography for the better.

Japan has a long and proud record as a high speed rail pioneer. Indeed, we in Britain have looked on with admiration at your achievements in this field.

But we have learned from your experience, as well as admired your progress. And now we are proposing a national high speed rail network in our country.

I am convinced that, as in Japan and in France and Spain, such a network would not only slash journey times between our major cities and regions, but transform the way our economy works.

Improving connectivity for our communities and our businesses; boosting productivity and improving competitiveness. And by making high speed rail the mode of choice for long-distance inter-city journeys, we will reduce the carbon footprint of domestic travel still further.

## Aviation

I cannot talk about reducing transport emissions without highlighting the urgent need to tackle the aviation sector's fast growing emissions. Aviation plays a vital role in the global economy. However, in Europe and increasingly in other parts of the world, governments are facing demands to ensure that aviation is put on a sustainable path that it can deliver growth with decarbonisation.

It is clear that aviation emissions will best be managed at international level, but this can take a painfully long time. That is why, alongside operational and technological measures, the UK fully supports the inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System or ETS. The ETS delivers an emissions cap in a cost effective, monetised and flexible way, allowing airlines to choose how best to meet their emissions quotas.

I recognise the concerns that have been raised in the last few months, but doing nothing is not an option. In addition to taking concrete steps, we will continue to work with like-minded states, such as Japan, in international negotiations in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in the hope that we can deliver an ambitious global agreement.

## Shipping

Maritime transport is another area where carbon emissions must be reduced. The adoption of the Energy Efficiency Design Index, as championed by Japan at the International Maritime Organization earlier this year, was very gratifying.

This was an important first step towards securing a comprehensive global agreement. So some progress has been made - but not yet enough. Once again, the EU is prepared to set the pace with a unilateral scheme if IMO cannot deliver the goods.

We, in the UK, look forward to working with the new Secretary-General, Mr Sekimizu, on this and IMO's many other challenges.

## **Concluding remarks**

In speaking to you today I have argued that, in our present circumstances, the only sustainable policies are those which deliver carbon reduction and economic growth.

Anything else will be rejected by an electorate that is more currently focussed on jobs and prosperity than the climate change agenda.

So we must focus on initiatives where there is overlap in delivery of these twin objectives and prioritise them, for the moment at least, over those where environmental objectives are at odds with the urgent need for growth and jobs.

I am proud to say that the transport sector can lead the way in demonstrating the path to green growth; in showing how we can maintain the momentum of decarbonisation while delivering the growth and jobs our electorates demand.

The twin challenges of economic growth and climate change; both urgent and both fundamental to our future. To meet them will require a particular focus and determination.

Not unlike the focus and determination Japan has shown in response to the effects of the earthquake and tsunami. This country and its people have reminded us that all things are possible with courage, determination and vision. And we will need plenty of all three to meet the twin challenges of climate change and economic growth.

Learning from Japan's example, I know that it's possible for us to come together, and work together, to build that truly sustainable future.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-20111005,Light Rail Awards,"Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","### Introduction

Ladies and gentlemen - distinguished guests. It's an absolute pleasure to be here to make a small contribution to a big event.

This awards ceremony is now in its 5th year and it is clear that the audience is getting bigger every year.

I am pleased to see that there is a strong overseas contingent here tonight. I do hope they will enjoy their stay and find some time in their schedules to travel on a couple of our light rail systems.

I'm also delighted to be sharing the stage with Nick Owen.

Nick is, of course, one of the most familiar faces on TV.

Over the years his journalistic skills have graced ITN, Channel 4 and the BBC.

He has also danced his way across our screens as a contestant on 'Strictly Come Dancing'.

I'm not going to be drawn on whether he was better than my fellow Lib Dem Minister Vince Cable.

### Light Rail - a good news story

Nick doesn't only have an interest in ""tripping the light fantastic"" - he's also a big fan of light rail.

So much so, that he is actually the voice of the Croydon Tramlink, where his dulcet tones announce each stop.

Regular users of that service will be relived to know there is no truth whatsoever in the rumour that I'm about to replace him.

What is true though is that, just like Nick, I am a fully paid up member of the light rail supporters club.

Which is a very happy coincidence, seeing as I'm also the Minister responsible for this particular mode of travel?

I'm proud to say that I have been a champion of light rail in and out of Ministerial office - and for two main reasons.

First, because I know that this is a transport system with a long and successful history - in fact, it has over a century of development and experience behind it.

But second, because I believe it's also a transport system with a bright future - and that's something we can see for ourselves right here in Britain, from Croydon to Sheffield, from the Midlands to Tyne & Wear.

Just think about the advantages, the benefits and the sheer potential of this mode of travel:

  * Light rail is a flexible, adaptable and comfortable way of moving large numbers of passengers along busy routes. Indeed recent statistics show that passenger journeys in England for light rail and tram systems have increased by 5.5% between 2009/10 and 2010/11 representing the highest number of passenger journeys to date.
  * It boasts a track record which shows that it is safe, fast and reliable.
  * And it's also one of the greenest and cleanest forms of transport - no emissions at source, very little noise and, with the right scheme in the right place, the potential to encourage people out of their cars and on to public transport.

For me that makes light rail a good news story for passengers, for business and for our environment.

I was also very pleased to see how quickly the teams at Croydon restored services to Tramlink following the disturbances over the summer period.

That is precisely why this Government is backing light rail

### Backing light rail

Since May 2010 we have supported a number of proposed extensions to existing light rail systems, including:

  * confirmed funding of over  £120m for the Manchester Metrolink extensions to Ashton and to East Didsbury which are currently under construction;
  * announced our intention to support an extension to Midland Metro through Birmingham city centre to New Street Station; and
  * will hopefully be announcing shortly final approval for the extensions to the Nottingham tram system.

I also published a report entitled 'Green Light for Light Rail', which follows a review undertaken on how we can make light rail more cost effective.

In addition, it explicitly acknowledges the importance of tram-train. Again, I am a big supporter of tram-trains - I really do believe they have a future role to play in our transport system.

The review has considered, amongst other issues, a number of specific areas which I know have been highlighted in the past as a cause of concern. These include

  * utilities,
  * standardisation,
  * and planning issues.

The review has also looked at where and how we can adopt, replicate and spread back practice.

I hope that you have had the opportunity to digest the report and I am anxious to ensure that we ALL move forward quickly in considering and implementing the recommendations.

And let me briefly highlight some of the key areas where we are asking questions and looking for your help to devise the solutions:

Implementing a new project design for light rail systems - one that's  uniform across the industry. In this way we can ensure that systems are not over-designed and project budgets are not over-spent

Setting up a 'centre of procurement excellence' - an innovation that would enable future promoters to get advice on the best procurement options for their project. Potentially this would make scheme procurement more efficient and less costly

And commencing a consultation inviting views from all the key players and stakeholders about the crucially important relationship between utilities and light rail.

So those are some of the issues and questions facing us. But what is the next step?

Well all of us - Government, operators, manufacturers, investors, and constructors - have to make sure that light rail has a bright and progressive future in this country.

And that's precisely is why I will be chairing a high level 'tram summit' of all interested parties in early November to discuss the issues and recommendations in order to develop a sector-led implementation plan for getting light rail on the right track.

I look forward to seeing many of you there.

### Paying tribute to the nominees

Now turning to the main event of the evening which I know is a celebration of excellence and achievement.

It's an opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have led the way, set the pace and made a real difference to the light rail sector.

Just making the awards shortlist is quite an achievement.

But I happen to know that the judging panel has been especially impressed by the sheer quality of this year's entries.

There are nominees who have developed innovations in everything from customer service to passenger safety.

Others have focused on innovations that can help make light rail even more eco-friendly

Some nominees have worked hard to enhance cross industry partnership and strengthen the supply chain.

And there are even nominees who have developed fresh approaches to campaigning on behalf of the light rail sector.

Individuals and teams, employees and operators, small projects and big projects - all very different but with one thing in common, they have all shown the power and potential of new ways of working and new ways of thinking.

No wonder the judges had to ponder so long and so hard.

### Concluding remarks

Okay - I've always believed that less is more - especially when it comes to public speaking.

Indeed, that point of view has been reinforced since I became a Minister.

Because that's when I discovered that Whitehall is the only place on Earth where a 10,000 word document can be described as a ""brief"".

So, with that in mind, it simply remains for me to thank you for listening and to wish you an enjoyable evening.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/hammond-2011100,"Transport Times, National Transport Awards","The Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, speaks at the Transport Times, National Transport Awards.","## Opening remarks

Thank you for that introduction. It's a pleasure to be with you all this evening.

This event is a celebration of **excellence and **achievement by some of the brightest and the best in the transport industry.

With everything from innovations in transport planning, to improving safety, to safeguarding the environment, the shortlist of nominations for this year demonstrates clearly the innovation and dedication that exists throughout this exciting sector.

We've seen nominations for individuals and teams; employees and operators; small projects and big projects; local and national initiatives.

All very different, yet all with something in common - because every single one of them shows the difference that the people of this industry make.

## Transport infrastructure - a fundamental component of the economy

The reason this event matters is because transport matters.

When I started this job, nearly 18 months ago, I made clear that Britain's transport system should be an engine for economic recovery - playing a vital role in getting this country open for business again.

Modern transport networks are the arteries of commerce, moving people to the workplace and goods to the marketplace.

And as we modernise our infrastructure, and encourage more sustainable forms of travel, we can cut carbon emissions, improve air quality, and offer a cleaner, greener transport system and a better quality of life.

Having inherited a deficit greater than any in our nation's peacetime history, it would have been easy for us to slash capital investment and side-step the politically challenging cuts in current spending.

Let's be honest, for decades this has been the traditional response of British Governments to fiscal pressure.

And transport is usually a favourite target of the swinging axe.

Well, not this time, and not this Government.

We have been prepared to take the tough decisions on current spending programmes and on welfare.

## Transport investments

Far from being targetted, transport capital emerged as a major winner in last year's Spending Review - with a commitment to invest over £30 billion in road, rail and local transport capital projects right across our country.

That's more than Labour invested in the previous four years.

And we are prioritising the projects that will get Britain back on the path to growth.

The biggest programme of rail investment since the Victorian era.

2,700 new rail carriages

A massive rail electrification programme

The green light for Crossrail and Thameslink and the Intercity Express Train

A multi-billion pound tube upgrade programme.

And we're investing £400m in support for ultra low emission vehicles to progressively green our car fleet - while bringing a new Nissan production line to Sunderland with hundreds of new jobs.

Helping to get Britain making things again.

## Re-inventing how we work

So transport investment can be a driver for economic growth. But transport also has to contribute to deficit reduction. And our commitment to investment must be balanced with a determination to re-examine and re-invent the way we do business, so we maximise efficiency and value for public money.

For example, on our railways.

As you all know, our railways are among the most expensive in Europe - with some of the highest fares in Europe and the highest levels of taxpayer subsidy as well.

And in the short term, we've had to take another tough decision: to increase fares above inflation, so we can carry on investing to tackle overcrowding and unreliability.

But it simply isn't sustainable to go on paying for the inefficiency of the railway with above inflation fare rises and massive public subsidy.

We have to solve this problem from the bottom up - by improving efficiency.

So Theresa Villiers, the rail Minister, and I will shortly publish a comprehensive blueprint for reforming our railways.

Asking the hard questions about taxpayer subsidy...

... _and considering the options for greater local commissioning of services,

as we seek to drive cost-saving innovations in service delivery.

Looking again at the role of Government, Network Rail, and the train operators.

Aligning the interests of all the parties

Making Train Operators more accountable to their customers.

... and Network Rail more accountable to the train operators.

And giving railway employees a real interest in the success of the companies they work for.

We're also looking ahead to the future with our plans for a new high speed rail network linking London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.

This is a project that would transform the social and economic geography of Britain - slashing journey times and putting desperately-needed new capacity on our railways.

As well as helping to close the North-South gap that has plagued our economy for so long.

## Aviation

And talking of the longer term, we're also working with the industry to develop a new long-term strategy for aviation.

Working out how best to plan for aviation expansion on a sustainable basis, within the limits implied by our carbon reduction targets.

Setting out a way forward for the next 40 years that will generate economic growth, meet our decarbonisation objectives, and manage the noise, and other impacts on local communities.

Kickstarting what will be, I hope, a new chapter in the aviation policy debate.

## Roads

Meanwhile, we are thinking smarter about how we get our roads and motorways working better.

We're investing £10 bn in our roads as part of the Spending Review.

And I've already talked about our intention to ensure that the car can retain a place in our future transport plans - by focussing on the real enemy, the carbon, rather than bashing the motorist, and making sure Britain becomes a leader in Europe in low-emission vehicles.

But we also have to be innovative and flexible about making the best use of the roads we have already paid for.

In one area, it might be peak time, or even permanent, hard shoulder running to ease congestion.

In another, it might be variable speed limits to keep traffic flowing.

And yes, we're consulting on a new motorway speed limit - a move that would put Britain back in the fast lane of global economies, boost productivity and deliver hundreds of millions of pounds of economic benefits.

Helping ensure our strategic roads become the arteries of commerce they were always intended to be.

## Localism

But it's not just about our national networks. The transport issues that most concern communities are often local in nature.

Yet, for far too long in this country, important decisions about local transport have been taken, and monitored, centrally - by Ministers and civil servants sitting in Whitehall, ticking boxes and filling in forms.

So we overhauled the way funding is delivered - slashing the number of separate local transport grant streams from 26 to just four, giving local authorities much greater flexibility and freedom to decide their own priorities.

And I have recently announced my intention to consult on how we can fully devolve decisions and funding for local capital transport improvements to ""Local Transport Consortia"", each made up of a number of Local Enterprise Partnerships and their constituent local authorities.

Putting decision making power where it belongs - in the hands of local communities.

## All the nominees should feel very proud of themselves

These are important times for the transport industry - no doubt about that.

As we seek to ride out the economic storm, we must continue to target investment where it makes the most difference, find new and innovative ways to fund capital expenditure, and continue relentlessly to control the costs of the projects we undertake.

Make no mistake, it will be a tough challenge.

But if these awards tonight demonstrate anything, it is that those who work in our transport sector have the capability, the ingenuity, and the commitment to meet that challenge head on.

Because when push comes to shove, it's the people in transport who really make the difference.

They make the difference because they understand the needs of the businesses and individuals that use our transport networks every day.

They make the difference because of their commitment to meeting those needs.

And they make the difference through the skills they bring to delivering those vital transport improvements on the ground (or in the air!).

That's who, and what, we are honouring tonight.

And over the coming months and years, I look forward to working with all of you to make our shared vision of a world-class British transport system a reality.

So thank you for listening, have a great night and the best of luck to all the nominees as they wait to hear if they have won an award.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20011019,London Chamber of Commerce & Industry Transport Dinner,"Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you for that introduction Willie (Willie Walsh, LCCI President) - it's an absolute pleasure to be with you this evening

I am deeply honoured that the Prime Minister has entrusted me with the job of Transport Secretary.

I'm also hugely excited about my new role. And that's because I know just how much high-performing transport systems matter.

They matter to our economy, our society and our environment.

They matter to our collective well-being and our individual quality of life.

And they matter because they make a difference not just today, but for generations to come.

So I am looking forward to the task ahead immensely.

This is actually my first speech as Transport Secretary.

And, at a time when the economy and the future of business is front and centre of all of our thinking, it is perhaps appropriate that I should be speaking to the LCCI - the respected voice of London business. I have met many of you before.

Now, while no Minister ever wants to disappoint an audience, you'll forgive me if I don't use tonight as an opportunity to set out my entire transport manifesto chapter and verse.

What I will say though is this: as Transport Secretary I will have a laser focus on ensuring that transport remains right where it should be - at the top of this Government's agenda.

## Testing Times

As wealth creators and business leaders you, the members of the LCCI, will know better than most the two big challenges facing Britain.

A global economy under severe strain

And of course, here at home, the Coalition inherited a deficit as bad as any in this nation's peacetime history.

So - challenges both home-grown and international.

Challenges for London too:

  * As a capital city whose population is projected to grow by nearly a million people in the next twenty years.
  * As a city where 24 million journeys take place every working day on our transport system
  * So often a gateway into our economy but also out to the global market-place
  * And as the 2012 host to the greatest show on earth - the Olympic Games.

Beyond any question we are living in testing times.

So how do we confront those challenges and meet those tests?

How do we sharpen Britain's competitive edge - improve our productivity, become the best place in the world to do business?

How do we harness London's power to drive the UK economy - to generate growth and create jobs?

Tonight I want to argue that modernising Britain's transport infrastructure is the key to answering these crucially important questions.

## Strong foundations, economic stability

Investing in our transport infrastructure means a better connected society and, if we invest it wisely, a cleaner and greener environment.

It is also good economics.

Cutting commuting times and speeding up journey times.

Moving people and products in a more reliable way.

That's how I want to see my role, one of backing British business.

But you can only build a modern transport system on strong foundations - and that means ensuring economic stability.

When the Coalition was formed nearly 18 months ago, we knew we faced perhaps the toughest agenda of any Government in modern British history.

But from day one, we have been absolutely clear about our priorities - tackling, first and foremost, the record budget deficit inherited from our predecessors, and rebuilding our economy after a long and deep recession.

Our resolve has been vindicated by Standard and Poor's recent confirmation of Britain's ""Triple A"" credit rating.

We are also focused on jobs and growth.

That's why we've launched the Growth Review and announced a ""credit easing"" scheme to help small businesses.

It's why, in the wake of the Thameslink rolling stock award, we're taking a long, hard look at public procurement policy - I believe in the free market, but I also believe in a level playing field for British firms.

It's also why we are reforming our employment laws, modernising our planning regulations, and easing the burden of regulation - policies to give businesses the room to grow and the conditions to invest.

## A clear break, a different choice

Nevertheless amongst the tough choices, there are some extremely positive ones. We have made a clear break from past governments by supporting capital investment at a time of fiscal retrenchment.

Under previous administrations, capital investment was always first to suffer when cuts needed to be made.

Short-termism became the British disease.

Well, no longer.

By putting in place strong foundations for long-term economic stability we are making a different choice - to invest in our transport infrastructure.

Last year's Spending Review was a statement of our intent - a bold commitment to invest over £30 billion in road, rail and local transport projects across the country.

And, to further support infrastructure investment and other development projects, we have also just announced £500 million Growing Places fund.

The fruits of our focused investment are becoming clear to see, not least in London.

Because if we want London to be globally competitive, it's absolutely vital that London has a world class transport infrastructure.

To support a labour productivity rate here in the capital that's more than 31% above the national average.

To maintain the city's position as the financial capital of the world.

And to fuel an economy that accounts for around 19% of UK GDP.

London is Britain's economic engine.

And, by investing in the transport infrastructure that serves and supports the capital, we can keep that engine powered up - for the benefit of the whole country.

## Investments modernisations boosting London

So we're cutting congestion on key strategic roads, like the M25, through innovations such as hard shoulder running and managed motorway technology.

My predecessor rightly won plaudits for shutting down the much derided M4 Bus Lane.

And he also announced a review of the decades old 70 mph motorway speed limit to speed up journey times and support economic growth.

In the run up to the 2012 Olympics, £6.5 billion has been invested to modernise transport systems in and around London.

The first ever domestic high speed train in Britain taking passengers from St Pancras to the Olympic Park.

More tube trains and, more seats for passengers.

Line extensions and new stations.

An incredible transport legacy for London.

Beyond the Olympics our Thameslink Programme will double capacity on one of Europe's busiest stretches of railway and make travelling across London and the south east faster, easier and more reliable.

We are pushing ahead with a multi-billion pound upgrade of the Tube as well as the transformational Crossrail project.

Together they will add 30 per cent capacity to the region's rail network and provide an estimated £78 billion boost to the UK economy.

London will also benefit from investment in national transport infrastructure.

Not least from our proposals for a truly national high speed rail network - HS2.

HS2 has the potential to transform the entire country's social and economic geography.

But think also of the potential positives for London.

Better connectivity and faster journeys.

Our major cities and regions brought closer to the capital...

New opportunities, new markets and new customers.

So we have consulted widely on our HS2 proposals, we are considering the many thousands of responses carefully and we will publish our response towards the end of the year.

London's key transport infrastructure doesn't begin and end with its road and rail links, however.

For centuries, shipping has been instrumental in bringing prosperity to London and the South East.

And today is no different.

By the end of 2013 there will be a new deep sea container port and business park at London Gateway, with DP World's very welcome recent announcement of a £1.5 billion investment in the port.

Driven by private finance, this project will mean the world's biggest container ships can call at the heart of Britain's capital.

It will also help create 32,000 jobs and add £3.2 billion to the national economy each year.

Another vote of confidence in the future of London, and in UK Plc.

## Heathrow aviation - transport is not a zero sum game

But it's another vital international gateway that is grabbing all the headlines during my first week as Transport Secretary.

**Heathrow **

And I accept that the Government's decision on Heathrow's third runway has had its share of critics - not least in this room tonight.

But while it's no secret that, in the past, Willie and I have been on different sides of the aviation fence on this one, we both inhabit the same world of political reality.

And the political reality is that the runway decision has been made, it's done.

But let me also say this. The decision we took on the third runway does **not** make this Government anti-aviation.

And it certainly doesn't make me anti-aviation. Far from it.

I know just how many of my constituents rely on an efficient, effective and successful Heathrow - for work and for travel.

So, as far as I am concerned transport is not a zero-sum game.

Economically, socially, environmentally every mode has an impact, every form of travel is a crucial part of the total mix.

And that includes aviation.

I passionately believe that the success of our airports and airlines is critical to the success of London and Britain.

The transport choices I make and the decisions I take will only ever be informed by the long term interest of this city, and this country.

So Willie, what I want to do is work with key players like you, and with the wider aviation industry, to change the nature of the aviation debate - to move forward constructively.

Indeed, I want to build on the work my Department has already carried out engaging with the LCCI, listening to your views on the future of aviation.

I honestly believe we can leave behind the polarised opinions that have dominated the discussion in the past. That we can find common sense, common ground - an inclusive consensus for change.

If we do that then I am certain we can improve and reform airport regulation and we can develop a new Aviation Strategy for the long term - one that supports economic growth while addressing the environmental impacts of airports and flying.

That's precisely why, through our Scoping Document, we have asked questions and engaged widely on a range of aviation issues - such as the economic benefits of aviation and the role of a UK hub airport.

I am absolutely confident that, if we change the nature of the aviation debate, then we will be able to generate a little less heat and shed a lot more light on the big challenges facing the industry.

## Concluding remarks

Tonight I have argued that we are facing challenges which are in many ways unprecedented.

I have also argued that, to meet these challenges, requires a stable economy and focused investment in our transport infrastructure.

This Government is working hard to deliver both.

That's a policy approach which makes sense for London - helping to cement its position as a competitive, productive, wealth-creating global player.

But it also makes sense for the rest of the country.

Because, when you have an economic engine as powerful as London's then, for the sake of the entire national economy, you need to make sure it can fire on all cylinders.

And that's exactly what our policies are doing.

So yes - these are testing times.

But, you have a Government determined to rebalance our economy and modernise our transport networks.

We are blessed with a capital that enjoys advantages which are the envy of cities around the world - from the global reputation of its financial sector, to the rich diversity of its cultural life.

And I believe we can boast a business community with the dynamism and determination to out-compete and out-produce any company and any nation any where.

That's why I know we can meet this moment and show the world why London is a great city and Britain is a great country with a great future.

Okay: in my first speech as Transport Secretary the last thing I want to do is keep an audience from their dinner - that's no way to build a future working relationship with Britain's businesses.

So I thank-you for listening and I look forward to working closely with you all in the months and years ahead.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20111020b,Speech at the Northern Rail Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Thank you Anton

It's good to be back in Leeds to take part in Northern Rail's conference today.

I'd like to congratulate their parent group, Abellio, on winning the Greater Anglia short franchise today.

If they are half as successful with this new contract as they have been with Northern, I'm sure passengers in East Anglia will be in for a really high quality service.

And of course it's been all change at the Department for Transport over the last week and this is a welcome opportunity to pass on the good wishes of the new Secretary of State.

Like her predecessor, Justine Greening fully recognises the crucial role rail plays in our economy and the vital importance of improving rail infrastructure in the North of England.

And so today I propose to take you through some of our key goals and ambitions for rail in the North.

### Context: Three years of change

It's three years since Northern hosted its first Rail Summit in Manchester.

Those of you who were at the inaugural Summit may remember the theme that day was the role of rail in delivering growth - a well chosen theme, considering the crisis in our economy in 2008.

We knew then that the road to recovery would be long and tough.

We're still paying the price for Gordon Brown's reckless decision to borrow excessively during the boom years leaving the cupboard absolutely bare when the bad times arrived.

Let's not forget that it was only May last year when the Coalition inherited the largest deficit in our nation's peacetime history.

And across Government, we are taking the tough action needed to tackle the deficit, support growth, and cut carbon.

With tight control on spending, combined with a robust plan to stimulate enterprise and jobs, we're taking the right route - the only credible route - to a brighter future.

Every Department and every industry has a contribution to make, including the rail sector.

For nearly 200 years, the railway has been bringing prosperity to the North.

Connecting people with the workplace, and goods with the marketplace.

Providing the links on which businesses rely.

And we believe that rail can play a vital role in spurring growth in modern Britain.

That's why the Coalition is today overseeing the biggest rail upgrade programme since the Victorian era.

For decades, British Governments have responded to the need to rein in spending by reducing capital investment - typically in large scale infrastructure schemes.

Certainly not because it makes economic sense.

Far from it.

The truth is that capital projects traditionally lose out during times of fiscal retrenchment because cutting other areas of public spending is more politically difficult.

Today, though, our priorities are clear.

We'll do what's best for our economy, and what's best for our country.

Despite severe pressure on budgets, we have made a strategic choice to increase capital investment in those parts of the infrastructure that best deliver sustainable economic growth - including rail.

That is why rail was allocated £18bn of funding in last year's Spending Review.

That has come with a downside - an RPI +3% increase in fares for three years to help fund the vital improvements we need.

But even taking that into account, rail came out of the spending review far more strongly than anyone expected.

And I think the outgoing Secretary of State deserved all the many accolades he received for his part in securing that result in the CSR.

### Rail investment in the north

There are a number of reasons why the Chancellor chose to prioritise investment in rail.

Not only can rail deliver growth. It can deliver more balanced sustainable economic growth across the country, helping to tackle the prosperity gap that continues to divide North and South.

So £300m will be invested in rail electrification in the North West over the next 6 years, upgrading crucial routes between Manchester, Liverpool, and Wigan.

This will deliver significant environmental, economic and passenger benefits.

It will also allow these lines to benefit from the rolling stock cascade triggered by the Thameslink programme and allow existing diesel trains to be used on other routes.

Thirty years after it was first proposed, the Ordsall Chord has finally got the go ahead.

Phase one of the Northern Hub programme, the Ordsall Chord project will tackle a major bottleneck in the network, and enable faster and much more frequent services to run across the North of England - including between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Hull.

Real investment in rail in the north.

And real support for the Northern economy.

We also recognise the benefits that the remainder of the Northern Hub programme could offer.

We'll be looking very seriously at the whole proposal in the run up to next July's HLOS 2 statement.

But there's no doubt that the package as a whole is an expensive one.

Affordability issues will need careful consideration, and it will be necessary to make a judgment on the different components individually.

This is unlikely to be an 'all-or-nothing' decision.

Alongside measures to improve the infrastructure, we're also modernising our rolling stock.

The next generation of Intercity Express trains is due to be built by Hitachi at a new assembly plant in County Durham... creating at least 500 jobs directly, plus thousands more in the supply chain.

In total, we're investing in 2,700 new carriages across the rail network to ease overcrowding on many routes.

Right here in Leeds commuters are set to benefit from an extra 2,000 seats a day.

Now I know that talking about rolling stock in the north of England can be risky if you're the rail minister.

I know that many passengers would like to see the Pacers heading into retirement.

But you here in this room will know that building a business case for new rolling stock is always going to be difficult when fares in much of the north of England lag so very far behind the rest of the country.

And let's not forget the growing importance of light rail in the North.

We are investing up to £350 million over the next 10 years to upgrade the Tyne and Wear metro... the largest renewal project since the metro was built more than 30 years ago.

And the Metrolink extension is going ahead in Manchester.

The network was built under a Conservative Government - and this Conservative-led Government continues to recognise the great benefits trams and light rail can bring.

The Tram Train Project between Sheffield and Rotherham is also progressing.

And we are currently considering proposals to develop the trolleybus scheme here in Leeds.

### High Speed

Despite our very significant commitment to updating and improving the existing railway, we also recognise its inherent constraints.

It is a 19th century network - valiantly struggling to support a 21st century economy.

It simply will not be able to absorb the growth in demand that we expect to see over the next few decades.

That's why in 2008, in Opposition, I championed high speed rail - at a time when the Labour Government had dismissed it as an option and ruled it out of their 30 year strategy for the railways.

I said then and I continue to believe that this is a project which can transform the economic and social geography of Britain.

Contrary to the allegations made by its detractors, HS2 is not, and never has been, about shaving a few minutes off the journey time to Birmingham.

It is about meeting the long term transport needs of our economy.

It is about delivering the intercity transport links that are absolutely crucial for future economic success

I firmly believe that high speed rail will do more to tackle the economic imbalance between the North and South than any policy tried by long the succession of Governments that have grappled with this seemingly intractable problem.

Although we are clear that the scheme will deliver benefits to the whole country, it is the North that stands to get most from HS2 - in the same way regional cities around Europe have flourished when connected to high speed rail.

High speed would not only transform journey times, reliability, and choice on our railway.

It would also free up huge amounts of capacity on existing lines, providing space for more commuter, regional and freight services on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main lines.

So after one of the largest and most complex public consultations in Government history, we are currently analysing thousands of responses from passengers, local communities, environmental groups, businesses, local authorities, and many others.

And we will publish our response towards the end of the year.

### Value for money/devolution

The improvements I've outlined this morning will deliver more capacity, better connectivity, and better services for rail passengers in the North.

But on their own they're not enough to meet the challenges faced by all of us who care about the UK's railways.

I'm sure you know the issue I'm coming to.

That is, of course, value for money.

Sir Roy McNulty's study set out the scale of the challenge - with his conclusion that Britain's rail network is now up to 40% more expensive per passenger mile than those of our European competitors.

This has contributed to increasing public concern about the level of rail fares in many parts of the country, particularly the south east.

It has also led to some of the highest levels of public subsidy in Europe.

This high-cost status quo is neither acceptable nor sustainable.

So we are carefully considering carefully the detailed recommendations that Sir Roy produced.

That includes assessing the scope there is to devolve more responsibility for commissioning local and regional services from the centre to local bodies.

As we do in so many areas, this Government recognises the benefits localised decision-making can bring to transport. Strengthening accountability to local communities and passengers, deploying local knowledge and understanding of the consequences of different choices.

The success of community rail gives us a hint of the benefits local input and commitment can bring.

The refranchising process for Northern and TPE will provide a real opportunity to test the case for devolving more decisions to local authorities and PTEs.

Discussions are ongoing between the DfT and the PTEs, with a number of options on the table.

There are many issues to resolve, not least of which is whether to devolve right down to a very local area or try to create a consortia of local authorities to input into decisions across more of the Northern franchise network.

But as well as a more localist approach, we also want a more transparent one.

Providing the public with more visibility over where rail subsidy is being spent won't be without controversy - but it is an important part of our strategy for reducing costs.

In the Department's Business Plan, we have made a firm commitment to greater transparency.

We have already started to publish information about where subsidy is allocated, on a franchise by franchise basis.

This includes direct TOC funding from the Government and an estimate of how much of Network Rail's grant can be attributed to the infrastructure used by each franchise.

And we're moving towards breaking down performance data by line rather than just the overall figures for the franchise.

But we want to go further.

And in due course we want passengers to know the real cost of the services they are using, and how much their fares are contributing to them.

Another key area for reform is franchising.

We pressed ahead with this from the early days of the Coalition.

The Coalition Agreement commits us to longer more flexible franchises and a departure from the excessive micro-management that characterised the approach of the previous Government.

By introducing longer, less prescriptive franchises, we want to give the industry more freedom to innovate, and a stronger incentive to invest in better services and address passenger needs.

For example, our draft specification for the West Coast franchise published in the summer represents a significantly more flexible approach than the rigid timetable and service specifications of the past.

The draft ITT set out a framework which continued to mandate key elements of service, such as minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day but give the winning bidder greater scope to organise services in a more commercial way and to respond to peaks and troughs of passenger demand.

We're replacing the ""cap and collar"" revenue support system with a GDP risk-sharing arrangement.

This will continue to offer train operators some protection from the big macro-economic risks that it's expensive for them to take on; but it avoids some of the perversities of the cap and collar regime.

We will build on these changes in future franchise competitions.

In many ways, West Coast is a staging post in a progressive reform we will roll out as our major programme of refranchising moves forward.

And of course in the future we propose to include in franchises the sort of aligned incentives that Sir Roy McNulty identified as a key way to address the high unit cost of the railways.

Much work remains to be done but Network Rail is already devolving its operations to give route managers more autonomy.

And work is actively underway between Network Rail and operators such as Scotrail and SWT to develop the alliances that could play an important part of delivering the strong shared incentives needed to get costs down.

And perhaps most difficult of all, we'll be reviewing fares regulation to see if we can eliminate some of the many anomalies it contains, smooth out the most extreme cliff edges, and better incentivise off-peak travel.

And let me make it absolutely clear that as part of this process I will be expecting the rail industry to step up to the plate to ensure that they deliver a more user-friendly system for passengers.

A modern fares system that helps fill up empty trains and spends less on transport thin air is bound to involve some complexity.

So an important component of a successful reform should be aimed at ensuring that when passengers buy tickets, they can navigate the choices available and find the best ticket for their journey without too much uncertainty and too much hassle.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I genuinely believe that the measures I have outlined today represent a serious and credible programme to generate growth and strengthen the competitiveness of the north of England by improving its transport infrastructure.

I think they give us the chance to deliver a real shot in the arm for the Northern economy.

A chance to deliver the improved capacity and connections that cities and communities across the North need to grow and prosper.

None of us should underestimate the scale of the task on which we have embarked.

Delivering the change we need will require a huge effort from both industry and Government.

I am confident that an industry that has achieved so much in recent years - an industry that has reversed a long term trend of decline - will be equal the challenge.

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/penning-20111025,ASEM Ministerial meeting,"Speech by Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

It is an honour to represent the United Kingdom at this important occasion. As a global trading nation, it is vital for the UK that transport links with Asia are fostered and expanded.

We are keen for our companies to participate in Asian markets, and we welcome investments by Asian companies in the UK - not just those from advanced economies in the region, but also from countries that are still developing and expanding their horizons.

We have long historical connections with Asia and the Asia-pacific region. Of course, there are sister countries of the UK in the British Commonwealth, and her Majesty Queen Elizabeth is already in Australia for the Commonwealth heads of Government meeting. The Commonwealth is a force for peace and prosperity, and holds a special place in British hearts for its traditions and spirit of harmony.

But we also have long-held contacts with other countries in Asia, great and small. The English language, so widely spoken, is one of our key assets and one of our gifts to the world - even if so often spoken with an American accent!

The themes of our meeting are sustainability, safety and efficiency. Each of these is critically important for the United Kingdom.

Moving to a green transport future is a major goal for us. We need to revitalize our economy after the shocks of recent times, but growth that ignores environmental responsibility is not, ultimately, sustainable. That is why we are investing heavily in such policies as the de-carbonisation of road transport through advance technologies, and pushing for stringent measures to control emissions from aviation and shipping.

We are also tackling our remaining air pollution hot spots - a problem which particularly affects rapidly growing cities in Asia, and which harms the health of the people.

Safety is also a primary concern. For many years the UK has been a world leader in road safety. Our roads are the safest in the world, alongside Sweden and the Netherlands.

On Wednesday I shall have the privilege of visiting the Tangyuan middle school in Chengdu, which was re-built after the terrible earthquake with money given by one of our famous British companies, BP. I shall talk to the students about British road safety practices and philosophy - my own small contribution to helping prevent deaths and injuries from traffic accidents in Chengdu.

At this point I should also pay tribute to the unbreakable spirit of people in Asia in the face of Natural Disasters. The British people have been moved by the resilience of Asian communities - in China, Japan, Pakistan and elsewhere - when disaster strikes.

The third and final theme of our meeting is the promotion of seamless travel, both for goods and people. This is another shared goal for the UK.

This is not just about advanced technologies and systems, It is also about reducing barriers and allowing free and fair competition. I would love to see my government's new 'Red Tape challenge', which is identifying hundreds of outdated or burdensome regulations for the scrap heap, being replicated around the world.

Sustainability, safety and efficiency. Three concepts which my country supports fully. We look forward to working with our European and Asian partners, both public and private sector, in our quest to make these concepts a reality.

Thank you very much.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20111031,AOA Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","Thank you for that warm welcome.

And thank you Ed [Ed Anderson Chairman of the AOA] - both for the kind words wishing me well in my new job and for inviting me along, it's a real pleasure to be with you all today.

Thanks also to Andrew for playing his part in the proceedings as Conference Moderator [Andrew Neil]

Actually, the next 20 minutes or so will be a rare and treasured moment for me.

And that's because I'll be able to speak safe in the knowledge that, just for once, Andrew can't interrupt me before I'm finished.

It's a great honour for me to be speaking to such a distinguished and expert audience as the new Transport Secretary.

I've certainly had a whirlwind two weeks since taking up my job. Getting to grips with my new brief.

Getting out and about too. Nobody ever learned anything stuck to a chair in Whitehall.

And that's very much part and parcel of who I am and the way I want to do business.

Coming to events like this.

Engaging with, and listening to, people across our transport sectors and networks.

Now, like any politician, I hate to disappoint an audience.

But, as tempting as it may be, at this stage it's probably a bit early to be laying out my entire transport blueprint.

That said, I will at least make this iron-clad commitment: my focus in the coming weeks and months will be on making sure that transport remains right where it should be - at the top of this Government's agenda.

## A successful aviation sector, a growing economy

I have to say that I'm especially pleased my first keynote conference speech is to an aviation audience.

One reason is because I had the pleasure of working with many of you during my time as Economic Secretary to the Treasury - and I can see some familiar faces in the audience.

But the second reason is that I recognise, and value, your crucial contribution to UK plc.

The members of the AOA, the people in this audience and the range of aviation companies you represent... you are all key players in a key sector.

And, in his speech, Ed rightly underlined the massive difference that sector makes to all of our lives.

Not least, the jobs it creates and supports

The way it gives British business a gateway to the global marketplace

And yes - the taxes it pays to the public purse that keep our public services going.

It's no exaggeration to say that a successful aviation sector goes hand-in-hand with a growing UK economy. For me, they really are two sides of the same coin.

## Heathrow - time to turn the page and write the next chapter

When I think about our shared challenges I couldn't put it any better than the theme of your conference - these are _""tough economic times""._

So our task as a Government is to do everything we can to ensure that businesses take root, people find good jobs and Britain's competitive edge is razor sharp.

And, as I've said, I'm with Ed and the AOA on this one - aviation has a front and centre role in helping us deliver those key economic objectives.

Now, I know that some people might say _""well what about expansion at Heathrow?""_

And yes, I accept that the Government's decision on Heathrow's third runway has had its share of critics - not least among this audience.

But we need to be honest with ourselves - because all sides in this debate inhabit the same world of political reality.

And the political reality is that the runway decision has been made, it's done.

But I want to emphasise that the decision we took does not mean we are anti-aviation.

This Transport Secretary and this Government are anything but.

I know just how many people rely on an efficient, effective and successful Heathrow - for work and for travel.

I get just how crucial aviation is to our national well being - economically, socially and environmentally.

And I recognise that the industry needs certainty and decision making in the long-term national interest - not chopping and changing for reasons of short-term political advantage.

So I would simply say this to you - it's time to turn the page and write a new chapter in the story of aviation.

Prominent in that new chapter will be a credible, workable aviation strategy.

And the industry is absolutely right to stress just how much strategy matters

But sometimes it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that strategy is all about dealing with single issues, such as capacity for example.

I believe our aviation strategy for our country has to be far broader-based than just the capacity question, though I recognise the importance of that question.
Actually, the best strategies cover all the bases.

They're focused on the short term and the long term; the economic and the environmental; the local and the global; the needs of the sector and the needs of the passenger.

So, in what remains of my speech, I want to walk you through what we're doing already, as well as talk about where I want to get to as we move forward.

## What we're doing already - improving the passenger experience

So what are we doing right here and now?

Well, the AOA has been working closely with my Ministerial colleague Theresa Villiers, as part of the South East Airports Task Force.

So, with your help and input, we are already engaged in the process of improving our airports and, by doing so, improving the passenger experience.

And that passenger experience has to inform everything we do. Satisfied customers - as I know from my time in industry, before becoming an MP - are the life-blood of every successful business.

That's why we're working with the UK Borders Agency to reduce queues at border checks, while maintaining the highest levels of security. Let me be clear that passenger safety and security will always be a top priority.

To also benefit passengers, we're reforming ATOL.

Updating it. Bringing it into the 21st century in a way that enhances consumer protection.

The AOA will know better than anyone that we've been cracking on with the business of modernising the 25-year-old framework for the economic regulation of our main airports.

And, in the spring of next year, we will legislate for a new regime to boost the quality of service that airlines and passengers receive.

We are also developing a new regulatory system on aviation security - one where Government will set the security outcomes to be achieved, freeing up operators to devise best ways of delivering them. Tailored better to the security needs of airports to maintain and enhance passenger safety and security.

## What we're doing already -  improving resilience

Another immediate step we're taking is to trial the use of operational freedoms at Heathrow.

In fact, this starts tomorrow.

And it's an innovation that could help reduce the number of late departures, particularly unscheduled night flights, and allow the airport to recover more effectively on days when poor weather, or other problems, disrupt flights and delay passengers.

In short, it could help to improve resilience. However, it's a pilot and we'll make sure we find out how it works with practice.

Challenges with ""ash clouds"" and ""snow falls"" are reminders of just how importance improving resilience is.

I know that lessons have been learned, work undertaken, investments made and resilience measures put in place since we all experienced the disruption caused by erupting volcanoes and freezing winter.

We do need to be prepared. The better the preparation, the better resilience.

And so I'm ready to work with the industry to make sure that prepared is exactly what we are.

I am determined to invest both time and effort where I can help make the difference.

That's why I am pleased that Colin Matthews welcomed my suggestion that I visit Heathrow to hear directly from their Leadership Group about the steps they've taken to improve their winter resilience.

And I didn't suggest an early trip to Heathrow because other operators aren't on my resilience radar. They are, and I, of course, want to engage with them.

But, ultimately, I recognise Heathrow is our busiest airport and a vital international hub, whether you are a passenger or a business operator.

Their preparations are crucial to the economic interests of our country-not to mention the travel plans of passengers.

So naturally, I am keen to hear about the progress they are making and whether there is best practice that can be more widely shared and adopted.

## Moving Forward - sustainability (the environmental challenge)

If that's just some of what we're doing already, where is it that I would like us to get to as we move forward?

Well, in a nutshell, the long-term vision is for an aviation sector that is successful because it is sustainable.

In other words, an aviation sector that can grow and help our economy to grow too. But also an aviation sector that achieves these goals while addressing its local and global environmental impacts.

Ed himself spoke about environmental sustainability.

And he reminded us of the real progress being made to cut emissions and combat the industry's contribution to our carbon foot print.

New technologies and new designs, lightweight materials and new fuel efficient aircraft - all making a positive difference.

I very much welcome that progress. And I understand that maintaining it, pushing on, isn't always easy.

But, I also believe there's something that aviation has in common with every other sector of our economy: namely that, just like the resilience challenge, the environmental challenge is one we simply have to meet.

Every industry, every business faces that self-same challenge. As does the Government.

And that's why we ask no more of one sector than we do of another. The journey towards a cleaner, greener future is one we all ultimately have to go along together.

## Moving Forward - New Framework

To help us move forward strategically we have taken a fresh look at the structure of aviation policy with our Sustainable Framework.

And I'd like to thank the AOA, and the many others gathered here today, for submitting their response.

That Framework - and the process of engagement that accompanied it - was a recognition that the Government does not claim to have a monopoly of wisdom about the best way to build a successful future for aviation.

We wanted, we needed, your input and your views. Your answers to a range of questions on key issues - from the economic benefits of aviation and the role of a UK hub airport, to how we accommodate growth in a genuinely sustainable way.

Coming out of this exercise I honestly believe that we can - and I think we have to - leave behind the polarised opinions that have dominated the discussion in the past.

And I think we can develop a common sense path forward and some common ground. This is vital to make progress.

## Moving Forward - Strategy is a two-way Street

And that brings me to the final point I want to make about moving forward and where I want us to get to.

Because, for me, the way we've gone about the Sustainable Framework demonstrates an inescapable truth- that strategy is a two way street.

Yes of course, Government has a responsibility to map out a route to a successful and sustainable aviation future.

But the industry itself must also step up to the plate.

How do you want to move forward?

What are your ideas for change and progress?

How do you think we can meet the challenges that are out there?

For all those of you who worked with me in the Treasury, you will know that I am open and willing to listen to the views of industry - and I will have exactly the same approach here in Transport.

Perhaps in this industry more than most, different players have a very different view of what ""good"" looks like.

For my part, I am convinced that the best solutions emerge when all sides are fully engaged and properly involved.

Now, that doesn't mean setting up a talking shop. Many people would say there's enough hot air in the world, we don't need to add to it.

Instead, it means both sides committing themselves to a can-do process.

A better way to do strategy. One that empowers us to develop real world solutions to the real world challenges facing aviation.

It's an approach I adopted at the Treasury, working successfully with the oil industry to deliver investment in North Sea exploration.

And, building on our work with the Sustainable Framework, it's an approach I intend to maintain now that I am Transport Secretary.

So, what I want is engagement that is organised and structured.

It must also be regular. That's essential.

Sitting down together. Meeting on regular occasions throughout the entire year - spring and summer, autumn and winter.

And that will be my approach to working with the industry - a structured and constructive approach so you know what our timeframes are for looking at the key issues.

## Concluding Remarks

Before I conclude, I want to briefly return to those key words in to your conference theme - that these are tough times.

It is true.

The inherited debt and the state of the global economy perhaps means they are the most testing for a generation or more.

And, yes, I know that the task we have set ourselves - to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of aviation against this economic backdrop - that task is incredibly hard.

But it's possible.

With the help and partnership of people like you - the members of the AOA, indeed all the women, men and companies of our aviation sector - I believe it can be done.

So, before I conclude, if there's one message I'd really like you to take away today then it is this:

if the Government and the aviation industry come together and act together then, not only will we be better placed to see the challenges coming,  we'll be ready, and able, to meet them head-on.

So I thank you for your time and your hospitality and I look forward to working incredibly closely with you all in the months and years ahead.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20111121,Rail Delivery Group Industry Forum,"Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening remarks

Thank you for that introduction

And thank you also for inviting me along today.

All of you are key players in a key industry and so I'm delighted to have a chance to make my own small contribution to this important event.

I do need to make an apology though. And that's because other Government commitments mean I can't stay as long as I'd like to.

But I'm pleased to say that my colleague, the Minister of State for Rail Theresa Villiers, is also here today to answer your questions.

## Investing in rail is good economics

It was clear to me in my job at the Treasury, and it's even clearer to me as Transport Secretary - investing in rail is good economics.

Cutting commuting times and speeding up journey times.

Moving people and products faster.

Connecting our communities and supporting our businesses.

That's how we can create jobs, generate growth and help Britain out-compete and out-produce the rest of the world.

And ""investing in rail"" is exactly what this Government is doing with  £18 billion of rail funding in last year's Spending Review and the biggest programme of railway modernisation since the Victorian era.

As a Government, we recognise that each investment, each modernisation can have a tremendous ripple effect, whether it's less congestion and more capacity, or fewer delays and greater reliability.

So, focusing resources on our railways, renewing and re-building our infrastructure - these things make a positive difference to services and to passengers, to our economy and our country.

That's the rail reality.

## Change & reform for a purpose

But there is another inescapable rail reality. And it's one that I know you all recognise: investment must be accompanied by change and modernisation must go hand-in-hand with reform.

I'm not talking about change and reform for their own sake, but change and reform for a purpose - ensuring our railways are efficient and affordable.

Now, in a Europe where our neighbours are competitors as well as partners, there are many areas where I want Britain to be number one, ahead of the pack and top of the table.

Having the most expensive railway is definitely not one of them.

But, as Sir Roy McNulty concluded, that's exactly the position our railways are in.

As you will know, even after allowing for unavoidable differences, Sir Roy estimates that UK rail costs are 20 to 30% higher than they should be.

Little wonder that he found significant scope in our railway system to eliminate waste and cut costs. Potential savings of up to £1 billion a year could be found by the end of this decade-. and all without any reductions in services.

And here are some other facts that should make us all sit up and take notice.

Since 1996-97 passenger numbers have risen by around 57%.

Against this background you'd expect unit costs to fall.

Yet, today, they remain almost exactly the same in real terms as they were in 1996-97.

To me, as a former chartered accountant, let alone as Transport Secretary, that just doesn't add up.

## Efficient & affordable equals successful & sustainable

For too long the railway has relied on ever-increasing public subsidies on one hand and ever rising rail fares on the other.

And that means we face a choice on this... two very different options which would lead to two very different futures for the rail industry.

Option One is that we deliver value for money for taxpayers and fare-payers... that we drive down costs and drive up efficiencies.

Option Two is that we do nothing and stick with a status quo of expensive to build, expensive to run and expensive to maintain railways.

That's a stark choice. But it's an easy choice because the ""do-nothing option"" is actually no option at all.

The truth is straightforward and undeniable: the rail industry will only be able to compete for future investment if its long-term cost issues are addressed.

And let's be frank, if you don't cut costs then, eventually, your only alternatives are to cut services, hike fares even higher or do both.

If there was ever a business model designed to condemn the industry to short-term stagnation at best, and long-term decline at worst, then it is definitely this.

So our only option, our only course of action, is to deliver better value for money on our railways.

Without question such an approach will boost the business prospects of this vital national industry.

And it will improve the travelling experience of rail users too, by releasing resources that can be re-invested in services and infrastructure.

It could even mean an end to inflation-busting rises in regulated fares.

That's why, for me, it's a very straightforward rail equation -.efficient and affordable equals successful and sustainable.

## Government must play its part

So that's the challenge we face - costs down, efficiency up.

And Government must play our full part in meeting that challenge.

So we are constructing a supportive policy framework, hence our reforms of rail franchising.

By introducing longer, less prescriptive franchises, we want to give the industry more freedom to innovate, as well as a stronger incentive to invest in better services and address passenger needs.

We're also bringing the days of Whitehall micro-management to an end, devolving more responsibility for managing the railways to local levels.

Change and reform must always work for and make sense to the people and businesses that use and depend on rail, whether it's commuters or freight customers.

That's why the Government wants to help fare-payers by moving towards a simpler, fairer and much more user friendly system.

And it's why we recognise the importance of increasing transparency.

Rail customers must be able to benchmark performance and taxpayers must be able to see how their money is spent and what their subsidy is buying.

Potentially greater transparency could result in greater feedback for the industry, helping the industry to really know their customers, to understand what they want from rail services.

We are also determined to build on the value for money work carried out by Sir Roy McNulty... which means setting out our wider vision for a sustainable and successful railway, including reform of Network Rail.

So, last week, I announced my intention to publish a Command Paper early next year.

I've done so because, as a new Transport Secretary, I am determined to give this the focus and attention it deserves.

Publishing our Command Paper early next year will therefore give me time to consider all the key issues around rail reform.

It will also enable me to look at what emerges from the Government's Growth Review, a landmark review that I am certain will shape the future of our economy and vital transport infrastructure like rail.

And, equally as important, it will mean the Command Paper can properly reflect the consequences of my decision following our consultation on a national high speed rail network.

Alongside the Command Paper I also plan to consult on the scope to devolve responsibility for some rail passenger services in parts of England to sub-national bodies, and on issues relating to the review of fares and ticketing announced in May.

In addition, the ORR expects to consult later this year on possible changes to its role, particularly in respect of future franchise.

I accept there are some who were keen for every last dot and comma of our reform proposals to be written, ready and published this side of the New Year.

Well I want you to know that the decision to publish the Command Paper early next year is not one that I have taken lightly.

But rail reform matters.

So my priority is to get our proposals right, not rush them through.

## Industry leadership

If Government must play its part in meeting the big challenges facing our railways, then so too must the industry.

And I'm pleased to say that this Group, and this event, demonstrate the industry's willingness to step up to the plate.

Your leadership counts.

The decisions you make and the actions you take - they can all have a positive impact.

And Government wants to help and support you as you meet the challenges and make the changes because we understand that all of us have a stake in this.

None of us can pursue reform alone or in isolation. There needs to be a new culture of partnership and collaboration, as exemplified by the RDG.

Trade unions and train operators, Network Rail and the ORR, Government and industry. We must all work together. We must all do our bit because we all stand to lose if rail becomes ever less competitive and ever less affordable.

## Concluding Remarks - the only game in town

This audience knows better than anyone that our railways cost more than they used to and more than they ought to.

You also know that such a state of affairs is as unsustainable as it is unacceptable.

Left unaddressed it will hurt passengers, freight operators and taxpayers.

Ultimately it will hit the industry and, in the long term, perhaps even damage our economy.

So we can't afford to side-step this issue or kick it down the tracks.

As we invest and modernise we must also change and reform - that really is the only game in town.

Building a railway that is efficient, that helps to drive our economy.

A railway that is affordable for hard pressed taxpayers.

A railway that, first, last and always, delivers for the people who are its commercial life blood - its passengers, its customers.

Yes, that's a huge challenge.

It requires us to be brave enough to think differently and bold enough to act decisively.

And it demands that we work together and work smarter.

But, when I come to events like this - and when I think about the expertise and experience that the RDG, and key industry players like all of you, bring to this task - I am convinced it's a challenge we can and will meet.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20111130,Olympic travel event,"Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening Remarks

Many thanks for that introduction Jo (Baroness Jo Valentine, Chief Exec London First), I'm delighted to be here today.

With the clock ticking, and the 2012 Opening Ceremony edging ever closer, this is an important event.

So a big thank-you to London First, to TfL and to everyone who's helped organise it.

## Getting the transport right

Beyond doubt the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games will give sport in this country a once in a generation boost.

They will be our nation's global shop window, our golden opportunity to showcase the best of Britain.

And that's why we simply have to make them a success - make them the very best they can be.

But delivering success in 2012 isn't just about fantastic venues or British athletes winning medals.

It's also about getting the transport right.

And I say that, not just because I am the Transport Secretary, but because I am also a London MP and, like so many of us here today, I depend on the tubes, trains and roads that serve and support our Capital.

Just like my constituents - and just like millions of others - the commuters; the mums and dads taking their kids to school; the people going shopping or just visiting friends and family, London's transport networks are part and parcel of my working and personal life.

I understand that the journey to work and the journey home again can shape your entire day, for better or for worse.

And I know that, at times, the daily commute can be pretty long and stressful as it is, before the additional pressures the Olympics will bring.

So my message to you is this - I get it. I know just how much transport will matter in 2012 - for everyone.

## A city open for business

It's precisely because of this that we've invested some £6.5 billion in upgrading and extending transport links, to increase capacity, enhance resilience and improve services.

This ambitious modernisation programme is already providing an impressive transport legacy:

  * The upgraded North London line-. with new, higher frequency, more reliable trains.
  * The extension of the East London line and the DLR to Woolwich and to Stratford International
  * The high speed Javelin service from St Pancras to Stratford Station
  * And new and improved walking and cycling routes to the Olympic Park, and to other venues, inside and outside London.

All these transport projects, and more, will still be delivering benefits years into the future.

But they also mean that London will be ready and able to be a world-class host next summer - a city that's open for business in a country that's open for business.

## Planning ahead

I do understand the scale of that challenge.

Without any question we face a big test. Indeed the proof is there in the transport heat-maps that TfL are publishing today.

Even with the investment and the improvements, the stress and strain placed on our transport system will be unprecedented.

Daily, up to 800,000 spectators and 55,000 athletes, officials, organisers and members of the media will be travelling to and from the Olympic venues.

And, while, on an average London workday 24 million trips take place, on the busiest Games' day an extra 3 million trips could be added to that total.

What does that mean in practical terms for companies, for employers and for the travelling public, Londoners going about their business?

Well, it means that at various times on key transport routes there are going to be a lot more people travelling... which, in turn, means there will be transport pinch points and travel hotspots.

What it doesn't mean is that London will grind to a standstill.

Yes, I acknowledge that, come the Games, we will have to think about how we can work differently and travel differently.

But, equally, I believe that if we all plan ahead, then we will keep London and the rest of Britain moving next summer.

Actually I am already struck by just how much planning is already in place.

I was over with Peter (Hendy) last week, looking at how Tfl are using new techniques to manage traffic on the network.

They will have monitoring on a scale never seen before - really sophisticated models of where queues are likely to arise and how to get traffic flowing again.

So when it comes to a transport legacy for London, I think this understanding of how to cope with so many extra visitors is a really big deal - something that will have benefits for years to come.

But we should also take advantage of the other opportunities that could arise.

Some firms may want to use the Games as an opportunity to think about how and when they get their deliveries or despatch their goods.

Other businesses might see this as an ideal chance to make much more use of communications technologies like video and tele-conferencing.

And some organisations could grab the opportunity to trial new ways of working - whether it's their staff working from home on some days, or coming in at more flexible times on others.

For those individuals travelling for work or for leisure, the period during the Games could be their chance to try a different route, stagger their journey time or work more flexibly.

For those who live near work, or travel short distances within central London, it could even be the excuse they need to cycle or walk part of their journey, or maybe even all of it.

## Giving a lead, working in partnership

No doubt, planning ahead can therefore help you meet the 2012 transport challenge.

But it can also help you to adapt and evolve and, in doing so, make the most of the very real opportunities the Games will bring to London, its people and its businesses.

And that's what our transport strategy, and this event, are all about.

Making sure you have the information and tools, the advice and the options you need to get from A to B, to run your businesses and to do your jobs.

And, of course, Government has to give a lead and set an example.

So my Department recently ran a trial to reduce its travel footprint, during which people managed to positively change 69 percent of their commuting and business travel, while still getting their work done.

And I'm pleased to say that, next February, Departments right across Whitehall will be following suit.

During the Games themselves the DfT is committed to shrinking our travel footprint by half.

We're working right now with staff to make sure we achieve that by changing our commuting, business and visitor travel, as well as our deliveries and collections.

And, as I say, it's right that we do these things. Because, we don't simply have a responsibility to work and communicate with key players like those of you here today, we must also play our part to lessen demand, ease overcrowding and minimise disruption.

But partnership matters too.

It's vital that we all work together to meet the 2012 transport challenge... central government and local government, the Mayor and TfL, LOCOG and the ODA, the business community and transport providers.

All of us doing our bit - 100 percent committed to keeping this City running and thriving during the Games.

I am certainly going to do what I can - getting the message across, working alongside businesses and taking the decisions that will keep London and Londoners moving.

For example, rather than having an M4 Games lane that nobody else can use for the entire Olympics, the decision I've taken is that we will have a flexible lane.

When it's needed for Games family traffic, it will be used for that, and shared with buses, taxis and coaches. But when it's not needed, we'll switch it off and it will be open to the whole public.

Something else I'll be doing is to encourage other MPs in the Capital to make sure their constituencies are ready for the challenge that awaits.

Using their local knowledge and their local networks, MPs are uniquely placed to inform and advise their local communities and employers about what they can expect and what they can do to make things run smoothly.

And so Peter and I will be holding a comprehensive briefing for MPs after Parliament returns from the holidays, making sure the wealth of information and advice that is being prepared gets to the people who need to know it.

## Concluding Remarks

Look at next year's Games through the prism of transport and it soon becomes clear that the challenge we face is real and it is significant.

But I am convinced it's a challenge that can be met.

The test we face is tough.

But, with planning, preparation and partnership we can keep our Capital and our country moving; we can stage a Games to remember; and we can do Britain proud.

Thank you

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20120118,"Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning & Transport (ADEPT)  - Annual Dinner","Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening remarks

Thank-you Matthew for that introduction (Matthew Lugg - ADEPT President).

And thank you also for inviting me along.

ADEPT and its members don't just help to shape the transport debate in this country - you also help to set the transport agenda, so it's a real pleasure to be with you this evening.

Now there are two important lessons I've learned since going into politics.

The first is that the words, ""I wish the Minister had gone on longer..."" are rarely on the lips of an audience at the end of a speech.

And the second is that you don't win applause, or for that matter any votes, by keeping people from their well-earned dinner.

So, with both of those lessons in mind, I promise to keep my speech brief.

### Good transport equals good economics

I am honoured and proud to be the Transport Secretary, just as I was honoured and proud to serve as a Treasury Minister.

And, in each of these roles, I have come to understand the crucial importance of a certain equation.

Now, as equations go, it's a pretty straightforward one. But it drives my policy approach at the DfT.

The equation I'm talking about is this: good transport equals good economics.

  * Cutting commuting times and speeding up journey times.
  * Moving people and products faster.
  * Connecting our businesses and wealth creators with the global economy.

That's how you generate growth and put people back to work. That's how you make Britain's competitive edge razor sharp.

The plain truth is that we cannot afford to sit back and look on while other countries invest in world class transport networks.

In the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, In the Middle East and Africa, and even in the United States and the European Union, nation after nation is upgrading and expanding their infrastructure.

They are our competition in the international marketplace, in the race to win the future.

Every bridge they repair and every road they improve, every rail track they lay and every global gateway they open drives their growth and increases their prosperity.

So, if Britain is to out-produce, out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world, then we too must update our transport infrastructure and make it fit for the 21st century.

And that's precisely what this Government is doing.

### A different choice

We know that ageing, past their best transport links are a tax on British businesses and British families. They cost them time and money.

Which is why we made a different choice.

Instead of taking the axe to capital investment, as previous governments did when the fiscal going got tough, we looked long-term and chose to invest in transport.

Take last year's Spending Review - over £30 billion for road, rail and local transport across the country.

We set up the £560 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund - a fund to give local communities more power to design and deliver local transport schemes.

We put in place a Growing Places Fund - half a billion pounds worth of support to help kick-start infrastructure projects.

And, in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, a multi-billion pound investment package in which transport took centre-stage - everything from electrifying more of our rail network, to easing congestion on our motorways.

### HS2 decision

This Government made a different choice about transport investment because we were looking well beyond the horizon.

Taking decisions to improve our national well-being, not just for the next four or five years, but for the next four or five decades. And not in spite of the economic challenges we face, but as a means to overcome them. And it's that same long-term national interest which motivated my recent decision to give the go-ahead to HS2 - a national high speed rail network

HS2 will slash journey times, shrink our country and radically improve the connections between our cities and regions.

It will help to create jobs and generate growth, promote social mobility and spread prosperity.

That's why I am absolutely convinced that pushing this project over the finishing line is the right thing to do for our country's success and our children's future.

Local matters

But it's not just the big-ticket national projects that can make a difference.

Improving our quality of life and enhancing our economic prospects also means investing in transport at the local level.

Nearly all journeys start, or end, on local transport networks. And those journeys can shape your entire day, for better or for worse.

It only takes a late bus, a packed train or a congested road and a short commute becomes an endurance test and a good day turns into a bad one.

So, as the members of ADEPT know better than anyone, local matters.

And, because it matters so much, not only did we announce 20 local transport schemes in the Autumn Statement, just before Christmas I gave the green light for a further 21 local major transport schemes. That's an investment package worth £854 million.

### Smart Localism

Modernising local transport networks, getting the very best out of them, isn't simply about putting in the resources, as crucial as that is.

It's also about devolving power - giving local people a real say over the transport services and issues that affect their lives.

It's what I call Smart Localism.

Smart because it recognises that a one size fits all approach cannot work in the modern, consumer focused world.

Smart because it enables local services, like transport, to be tailored to local needs.

And let me walk you through just a few of the ways we're making Smart Localism an everyday reality. We've simplified funding, cutting the number of separate local transport grant streams from 26 to just four and transferring some funding into formula grant.

And the end result of this radical reform? Local communities will have greater flexibility and freedom to decide their own priorities.

We are cutting red tape and ending pointless top-down bureaucracy.

One practical example: after the biggest review into Britain's traffic signing system for forty years we published a new framework that will free up local councils to remove expensive and unsightly clutter from our roads - a reform that will save money and improve the local environment.

We're looking at ways to devolve more responsibility for commissioning local and regional rail services - a move that could increase transparency, strengthen accountability and, by doing so, improve the passenger experience.

And we are also committed to implementing a more devolved system for local major schemes beyond 2015 - enabling local communities and businesses to take real decisions about the transport improvements in their areas; constructing a system that's much more responsive to local economic conditions and needs.

And with greater devolution must follow greater local accountability.

For example making sure new schemes achieve genuine value for money. We are ready to work with individual transport bodies to put in place a system that works for them.

I hope to publish a paper soon and invite views on early proposals for a new system and I look forward to seeing your response.

### Concluding remarks - productive partnership

Investment, reform, localism.

These are all important ways of transforming our country's prospects by transforming its transport system.

But so is productive partnership - government and stakeholders coming together and working together, pulling in the same direction to bring about real and positive change.

And I'm pleased to say that partnerships don't come more productive than the one between my Department and this Association.

Whether it's helping us improve winter resilience in the transport sector; leading work streams in the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme; or assisting us to review future options for the Integrated Transport Block allocation, ADEPT and its members have shown that they are sector leaders as well as productive partners.

So, before I conclude, and more importantly, fulfil my pledge not to keep you from dinner for too long, there's one final thing I'd like to do - and that's pay tribute to the work you do and the difference you make.

For decades, you have been at the forefront of the transport debate, both as the County Surveyors' Society, and more recently, as ADEPT.

In particular, you have played a vital role in managing and maintaining our infrastructure, and strengthening the links between transport and other drivers of sustainable growth and development.

Today, you are helping to shape the agenda on many key areas of Government policy - including planning, waste management, housing, and climate change, as well as transport.

And it is precisely because these issues are all closely connected that makes your work so valuable, and your contribution so appreciated.

Thank you for listening and I look forward to taking some questions

[Introduced by Professor David Begg, Publisher of Transport Times.]

### Opening remarks

Thank you for that kind introduction David... it's a pleasure to be here today.

And many thanks to you... and to everybody at Transport Times and the Railway Industry Association... for organising this event.

I can't think of too many people or organisations that could have got a conference like this up and running... or brought together an audience as expert and distinguished as this... at such a short notice.

My congratulations for delivering it on time, presumably on budget.

### Consultation

The announcement I made a fortnight ago was the culmination of a vast programme of work over the past year.

The [HS2 consultation](/topics/high-speed-rail/consultation/) was one of the largest in the Department for Transport's history.

We had five months of intensive engagement. 41 days of roadshow attended by almost 33,000 people. And almost 55,000 consultation responses.

And systematically going through the evidence and the alternatives, it was clear to me that the argument in favour of [HS2](/topics/high-speed-rail/) was compelling.

A modern,fast reliable, railway that will:

  * Transform connections between our cities, regions and the Continent.
  * Truly rebalance our economic geography, with a legacy of jobs, growth and opportunity for generations to come.
  * And change the way we travel, just as the first railway did in the 19th century.

But behind the headline statistics, HS2 is also about believing in better.

Do we believe in just making do. Is that all we have to offer our future generations?

This Government passionately believes they deserve so much more. In the same way that we are not prepared to leave them with a fiscal deficit, neither should we leave them with an infrastructure deficit.

And the children and students I meet at my local primary and secondary school - what kind of a Britain do we want to create for them? And, how can we make sure our country will be able to match their ambition?

For too long in this country, we have failed to grasp the nettle on the decisions that will help us achieve our long term aspirations.

We can't simply **hope** for a better, more prosperous future - we will have to build it. We won't suddenly wake up to a successful Britain, we have to create it.

If we want to live in a country that can compete and thrive in the global economy, and where our children can realise their full potential, then we have to tackle the problems that are holding us back.

And that's what HS2 is all about...

It's about understanding that we have a responsibility to make choices today that will improve our economy and people's quality of life, not just in the next four or five years, but in the next four or five decades.

### Restating the case

Now there are some people who question the size of our ambitions. Who say that Britain cannot support such a scheme in such austere times.

Well today I'd like to reassure them that this is the **right scheme** at the right time.

But to do that, I think I need to clear up some of the claims about HS2 that I've read in recent weeks.

Some commentators have said we are spending £32bn building a new line between London and Birmingham.

Well I have good news for them. £32bn will buy us a national high speed network, linking London and Birmingham with Leeds, Manchester, South Yorkshire and the East Midlands - and forming the base of what we hope is an even bigger network extending to Scotland in the future.

Some people have focused purely on HS2's time savings - claiming the investment is poor value just to shave a few minutes off today's journeys.

Well HS2 will certainly reduce journey times. In fact it will slash the trip from Birmingham to Leeds in half, and cut the Manchester to London time from 2hrs 8mins today to just 1hr 8mins.

These are dramatic time savings that will offer a step change in services.

Valuable as faster journeys are - and passengers tell us that the time factor is very important to them - more crucial is the substantial capacity boost that HS2 will deliver, reducing the increasingly overwhelming pressure on existing road and rail networks...

A rail network that will simply end up full in many places. If we don't take action, people say put more trains on the track, have more carriages on the trains on the track, well that's what we've been doing! There's no other way we would have lasted on a Victorian railway network otherwise. But common sense tells you that can't go on forever. And after 110 years we've nearly got to the end of forever. On some of our tracks there is simply isn't going to be any more space.

... so we need **MORE** track.

But high speed rail will provide up to 18 high speed trains per hour, each with up to 1000 seats... more room on the current railway as well... greater reliability; better performance; and more comfortable long distance travel.

Without investment in new capacity, our main rail arteries will grind to a halt during the 2020s, with disruption, overcrowding, and damage to our economy.

With demand for long-distance rail doubling over the past 15 years, inter-city trains are already becoming overcrowded, and commuters who may have no practical alternative to train travel are forced to stand on long journeys.

Unreliable, congested, transport would send out a message to investors that Britain doesn't really care about its infrastructure... or that we are incapable of delivering major projects.

For a modern, developed economy, that's not good enough.

And to continue to ignore the problem is no more an option that pretending our A-road system would have managed without the motorways.

Of course, we are doing what we can to modernise our current railway with £18bn of investment committed in the Spending Review, and pressing ahead with our plans to max out the capacity on the current track.

But even with that investment, the scope for squeezing out ever-more out of our ageing rail infrastructure is diminishing.

So it is simply not good enough to criticise schemes like HS2 unless there is a practical alternative.

And those alternatives that have been proposed have fallen short.

Upgrading existing major North-South lines would only provide a short term fix, and would consign passengers to years of disruption, delays and misery.

And high speed offers much better value than a new conventional North-South rail line - delivering £6.2bn more in benefits for an extra investment of just £1.4bn.

So high speed will give an additional return on the investment of more than four to one.

All the evidence has been considered. And we are clear that the only long term solution to the capacity crunch we face on our railways is high speed rail.

Some people think the capacity crunch will somehow naturally melt away.

One commentator claimed that high speed rail would soon be obsolete, because the advance in computers will mean that more people work from home. And rather than speed up, he actually suggested we ought to find ways to slow down.

Well I don't share his analysis.

We've seen mobile and Internet connectivity through technology transform in the past 15 years - and people have never travelled by train more.

And we will not get people back to work and secure economic recovery by putting a brake on progress, and telling passengers they have got to put up with slower journeys.

We all know that the world is moving ever faster. Technology is always developing. And we have to prepare for a faster future if we want Britain to prosper.

Who wants slower broadband? Who would choose to have a slow train journey rather than a fast one? And how can businesses hope to compete if they cannot transport goods around the country quickly and efficiently?

Modern manufacturers and retailers rely on just-in-time distribution to maintain profitability. Slowing down transport would merely act as a further barrier to investment, and as a drain on growth.

HS2 is about the nuts and bolts of Britain, and making our infrastructure work for us.

In country after country around the world, high speed rail has proved to be hugely popular with a wide market. Countries that have it invariably build more.

Today, high speed rail is a success around the world **because** it has a mass market.

HS2 will benefit every type of traveller - not just on the new network, but on existing lines too. More space and capacity freed up will help drive competition on the railway, changing the way rail travel is marketed and sold.

I do though, of course, accept that there is no easy way to build a train line through our country.

I understand and respect the concerns of people living or working near the line and we have gone to very great lengths to mitigate its impact - including a package of extra alterations announced on January 10th.

Of the 13 miles through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, less than 2 miles will be at or above the surface... the rest will be in deep cutting or tunnel.

These changes will bring significant benefits to communities and the environment; and, in fact, compared to the consultation route there will be a more than 50 per cent increase in tunnel or green tunnel.

And I welcome the comments of Shaun Spiers, Chief Executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, who said the Government had been sensitive to the impact that HS2 would have on communities and the countryside; and that their legitimate concerns about the effects of high speed on the landscape had been heard.

I will do my level best to work closely with communities as the High Speed project progresses.

### Industry opportunities

But of course there is another very key benefit of high speed that has not been reflected in much of the coverage over the past two weeks: the opportunities and jobs it will it provide for the rail industry in Britain; the jobs it will create for your companies and organisations.

For engineering and technology companies; rail operators; suppliers and component manufacturers; for infrastructure specialists; and many, many others.

All stand to gain as we write a new chapter in the story of rail innovation in Britain.

It will present this industry with a massive challenge.

Delivering a major national programme on time and on budget.

I believe we can meet that challenge and I believe we can develop expertise so British companies can compete successfully for key contracts.

The Government's National Infrastructure Plan sets out the importance of a predictable and transparent long-term pipeline of infrastructure projects that will help the private sector plan ahead and invest in technology and skills.

HS2 will form a key element of that long-term pipeline, providing certainty about future contracting opportunities following the completion of Crossrail in 2017.

To ensure that the UK-based supply chain is in a position to benefit as far as possible from this project, this Government will open a dialogue with potential UK-based suppliers to ensure they are well-placed to bid competitively.

You are already helping us deliver Crossrail, Thameslink, upgrades to major rail hubs like Reading and Birmingham New Street, and a major programme of electrification.

But I also want to put our best minds to work on high speed rail. To find uniquely British solutions to the challenges we face.

I want Britain to become a centre of excellence for high speed rail technologies and services, with a world-class R&D capability.

Sometimes we may collaborate with companies from other countries.

But from the very start our priority must be to develop the home-grown skills and capabilities that will not only help deliver HS2 - but that can then be used in other markets as high speed rail is increasingly adopted by countries around the world.

### Looking ahead

Now is the time to reject the short termism of the past, and get our long term future back on track.

The evidence from around the world is clear: as a fast, sustainable and viable way of long-distance, mass transport, high speed rail has no modern equal.

It's the right transport programme for passengers; for freight; and for rebalancing our economy.

I've seen the incredible enthusiasm for HS2 across our great cities. Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, these cities know the transformational value high speed rail will have.

They rightly believe that the future success of their regions and their communities depends on schemes like this - which will create opportunities on their doorstep. I will work hand-in-hand with them to make sure the jobs and the growth that we all hope for, actually happen.

I know most of us here today are convinced of the case for high speed.

But there are many who perfectly understandably will want to continue the debate. I welcome the opportunity to set out our case. Because it is strong and compelling.

But it is also important those who understand the benefits of HS2 continue to make their voices heard, and continue to highlight the transformational impact it will have on our railway and on our economy. Now more than ever our case needs to be made positively, clearly and fully informed by the facts.

We will prepare for a hybrid bill by the end of 2013, including a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment to provide the necessary powers to construct and operate the line from London to Birmingham.

This spring we will consult on the draft directions for safeguarding the proposed route from London to the West Midlands, as well as separately consulting on detailed compensation proposals.

In March [HS2 Ltd](http://www.hs2.org.uk/) will advise me on route and station options to Manchester, Leeds and Heathrow, and later in 2012 we will start informal consultation on a preferred route.

### Conclusion

To conclude, these plans will set in motion the most important transport project in this country since the coming of the motorways.

I warmly welcome the political consensus on HS2, on the basis that it will help ensure that the planning and construction of this transformational scheme is carried through to completion.

This is an incredibly exciting time for everyone who cares about Britain's railway and preserving its critical role supporting our economy.

But the benefits of HS2 will be felt well beyond the network and the passengers who use it.

This is a national scheme in the national interest.

It's about raising our sights. Future-proofing Britain's railway so we don't wake up in 20 years' time with a gridlocked railway regretting that we hadn't been bolder today.

And remembering that Britain can no more turn its back on the positive potential of high-speed rail than it could have opted out of the steam age.

We **will** build high speed two. We will make sure our country and our cities are connected for success.

And we **will** have in place the railway capacity that our future generations need for their success.

They need our plans put into action more than any of us here today and this Government will not let them down.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20120221,Plug-In Van Grant breakfast event,"Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening Remarks

I'm delighted that, today, we've got manufacturers here - and thank you for bringing your plug-in vans along... can't wait to see them up close.

We've got people who already own low carbon vans and some who are thinking of buying them

We may even have one or two sceptics - those yet to be persuaded of the merits of these new and exciting vehicles.

But, whatever your motive for being here this morning, I want to thank you all for making the time and taking the trouble to come along.

Now, while I have the chance, I'd also like to say a very personal thank you to Pete (Waterman), for providing the soundtrack to my youth and, of course, for letting us use this venue today.

Pete has been a solid supporter of what's cutting edge in transport - particularly on the rail side - and it's great that he is able to be here to lend his support today.

## A motorist & pro-environment

Cars and vans are absolutely central to people's lives.

It's how most of us get around and for many journeys they are, and will remain, the only practical and convenient travel choice -  not a luxury but an essential means of getting from A to B.

Nevertheless, climate change is a global challenge we simply have to meet head on. It cannot be ignored or side-stepped.

It is everyone's business and anyone who is serious about tackling this challenge must also be serious about reducing the environmental impact of motor vehicles.

And that's what marks this new grant out because, for me, it demonstrates that you can be a motorist and be pro-environment.

## Good for the environment, good for business

This new grant is good for the environment.

Electric vans will produce less air pollution and less noise.

And, by helping to cut CO2 emissions, they will also help the UK meet our climate change targets.

But the plug-in van grant is good for business too.

Businesses that run electric vans can benefit from reduced refuelling costs, get exemption from the van benefit charge, and attract capital allowance concessions, not to mention the 100% discount for the congestion charge in the capital.

But best of all, it's been estimated that a small electric van will typically cost £100 less in fuel for every thousand miles driven compared to a diesel equivalent.

If you want to see just how well plug-in vehicles can fit into fleets - and just how much commercial sense they make - I recommend a read of the Climate Group's report on Plugged in Fleets.

It's published today so, if you get the chance, pick up a copy.

## Plug-In Van Grant

I am really excited about our new Plug-in Van Grant, and let me tell you why:

  * It offers a 20% discount when you buy a new, eligible, ultra-low emission van...meaning up to £8000 off the purchase price.
  * It is available to both private individuals and business buyers across the UK
  * It runs alongside our continuing ""_Plug-In Car Grant""_
  * And it is designed to build on, and complement, our existing ""_Plugged in Places""_ recharging infrastructure programme.

I also think this type of low emission vehicles initiative is ideally suited for vans, especially if you look at the way they're driven and used in business:

  * Vans often have a predictable range
  * They make frequent stops
  * And many of them return to an overnight base where they can be easily recharged.

You might want to talk to some of the guests here today who have already taken the plunge and purchased plug-in vans.
I would particularly like to mention British Gas's ambitions with hundreds of electric vans scheduled to be introduced into their fleets over the next few years - a move that will significantly add to the numbers of plug-in vehicles on the road.

And I would strongly encourage those of you who haven't yet made the switch to plug-in vehicles to seriously consider it - not only for the environmental benefits but for what it could do for your own business's bank balance.

## Working with the grain

I'm convinced that the way to deliver real change is to work with, rather than against, the grain of human nature and every-day reality.

**And**, by giving consumers motoring options that are reliable and affordable, as well as cleaner and greener, that's precisely what these new grants are doing.

They also have the potential to create a virtuous circle by further stimulating investment in the mass production of ultra-low emission vehicles which, in turn, could bring down costs and further boost demand.

Supported by a growing charging infrastructure, these developments can help make plug-in cars and vans an everyday part of life for British motorists.

## Concluding remarks - take a look at the future

In essence, today is really all about setting out the path for tomorrow.

I believe these vans are going to make a real and positive difference - to communities and businesses, to how we live, drive and work.

But I don't think you should just take my word for it.

So why don't we finish up here, go outside and take a look at the future?

Thank you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/baker-20120321a,Highways Maintenance Efficiency,"Speech by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport.","## Introduction

Thank you, David, for inviting me to speak to you again today.

It has been two years since I first spoke, and I suspect I am eligible for a long service medal as a Transport Minister still in service after this period.

Today's conference is a forum to share good practice, and I'm delighted to be here to update you on the [Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme](/topics/local-authorities/hmep/), or HMEP for short.

## Highways Maintenance and Funding

Well maintained highways are important to the economy and to motorists and residents which this Government also recognises.

Despite the current economic situation that we inherited and recognising the ongoing need - some say that there is a historic problem that will take up to a decade to clear - we are providing £3 billion to councils across England for road maintenance between 2011 and 2015.

This is more in cash terms than the previous four years to help deal with the tail of problems inherited from several previous administrations.

That said, I also believe there is significant scope for local authorities to find efficiencies and achieve more from their spending on local roads.

And taxpayers would expect councils to take advantage of opportunities to drive down costs and drive up efficiencies through collaboration, better procurement and other means.

That was why I was pleased to launch HMEP last April, with the aim of helping the sector over the longer-term to maximise returns from investment in highways and reducing costs. As you know, the Department for Transport is supporting this with £6 million in funding.

At its core, HMEP has 3 foundation stones:

  * it is by the sector for the sector;
  * it offers practical, adaptable approaches; and
  * it is firmly results focused.

Let me also be clear - this is not a top-down imposition from the Department for Transport. It is there to provide the support and guidance that you - the highways maintenance community - have said would help.

## About HMEP

HMEP centres on a handful of key themes where efficiencies can be made.

These are:

  * improved management of the local highways assets and delivering better service to the public;
  * collaborative working between local authorities and with the private sector;
  * smarter procurement, and;
  * benchmarking of costs, quality and public satisfaction, to drive continuous improvement.

HMEP will provide practical guidance on highway maintenance efficiencies that will be of interest to all local authorities, supplier organisations and representative bodies. This will be in the form of guidance, case studies and tool kits detailing opportunities for savings in maintenance services. This includes identifying existing good practice that can provide real life examples of efficiency solutions.

The building blocks are now being put in place. I recognise changes won't happen overnight, but am very pleased that progress is being made. I am also grateful for the input of those of you outside the core group, including many of you here today.

## Some headlines from HMEP

I turn now to asset management in action, and the Pothole Review.

Potholes are an issue that brings many media stories, mainly - as you will have seen - negative.

You will know that the Department allocated £200 million in March 2011 to authorities in England for repairing damage to their road network, in recognition of the severe winter weather at the end of 2010.

This additional funding represented a significant investment in road maintenance at a time of severe fiscal restraint and demonstrates the Coalition Government's continued commitment to maintain our infrastructure to support motorists and businesses.

I am aware of further requests from councils for additional funding following this winter season, and I have been particularly lobbied by the East of England.

But as was made clear last year, the additional funding was made on an exceptional basis in light of the severe winter weather and the damage it caused to the highway network.

I am however pleased to be able to share with the Conference some of the key emerging findings of the Pothole Review, in advance of the final report to be published next month, which I hope will help you plan your maintenance strategies better for the future.

The main themes of the Review are:

Firstly, that prevention is better than the cure. By this I mean that intervening at the right time will reduce the amount of potholes forming and prevent bigger problems later, and help head off many of the costly insurance claims that local authorities are now facing.

Secondly, we need to do it once and get it right, rather than face continuous bills. Guidance, knowledge and workmanship are the enablers to achieve this.

Thirdly, we need clarity for the public. Local highway authorities need to communicate to their public what is being done, how it is being done and most importantly that it is being done or has been completed. This includes those instances why it appears that nothing is being done.

Finally, effective communication and engagement with local communities is vital. We all know that the condition of local roads is consistently ranked near the top in terms of transport priorities in public opinion surveys. This is why the Review recommends that local highway authorities both monitor public satisfaction with road and footway condition and repair, and ensure clarity and transparency in their approach to repairing potholes.

In addition, the pothole review also refers to utilities and the co-ordination of streetworks. And we are doing our bit here too.

We are rolling out the use of permit schemes to authorities across the country, to boost the control they have in dealing with utility companies. I am clear that we need to cut the bureaucracy associated with this process, removing the need for Departmental authorisation and giving authorities the power to manage their own streets.

And the Department has now put in place new legislation to allow local authorities to introduce lane rental charging, to further help in the fight against road works congestion.

This will involve utilities and local authority contractors paying up to £2,500 a day where their works take place on the busiest streets at the busiest times. It will provide a clear incentive to complete works at quieter times, and to invest in new disruption-saving techniques.

We announced last Friday 16 March that Transport for London will run the first ""pioneer"" trial scheme, due to begin in June this year. I should clarify that a condition of being able to launch a trial is that authorities should already be employing permit schemes to manage works on their streets.

The Potholes Review is providing valuable insights and I'd like to congratulate Matthew Lugg who has led this work with the project team, and encourage all of you to look at the report when it is published next month.

It is important that you take on board and consider carefully the principles arising from the review.

## Collaborative Working and Procurement

HMEP recognises the value of more collaborative working - because it provides real opportunities for economies of scale and cost savings, without undermining local sovereignty.

I have mentioned that a number of tools, resources and good practice examples will be made available via HMEP. This includes a collaborative alliances toolkit, based on good practice.

For example, the Midlands Highway Alliance (with a membership of 18 councils) has achieved around £12 million in cost savings over five years.

I am also pleased that other authorities in Yorkshire, South West, North East and North West are also actively considering setting up collaborative highway alliances. I would encourage all parts of the country to consider following this approach, appropriately tailored to local circumstances.

Furthermore, a review of the supply chain to negotiate savings with suppliers without going back through the procurement process is being piloted by the South East Seven highway authorities and the Association of Greater Manchester councils. This is based on models used in the housing supply sector where this delivered up to 10% in savings.

And finally, in London 34 highway authorities currently have over 100 contracts delivering £350m investment in their highway networks annually. These authorities have joined together and gone out to the marketplace with a shared contract for highway services. This is securing the best market rates and services for highway services, with a target saving of at least 10%, but still allowing choice as each council can chose the services it wants delivered through the contract.

I am sure you will agree that these are savings not to be scoffed at.

## What next?

There is a huge potential to make real cost savings for your authorities and still provide a first class quality service to residents and other highway users, as shown in some of the examples I've mentioned.

Please do continue to take an active interest in the tools and resources coming out of HMEP over the coming months.

We're all focused on delivering the best possible service as efficiently as possible, and I hope today's conference helps in that cause.

","## Opening remarks

James, many thanks for that introduction (James Hanratty).

Thank you also to the Club and its members for asking me to share your evening.

It's a real pleasure to be here - and for two main reasons.

The first is because, as a Cabinet Minister, my office is usually filled with Civil Service officials offering me advice on transport policy, media interviews. In fact, on almost every subject under the sun.

So frankly, any chance I get to speak for longer than two minutes uninterrupted is one that I grab with both hands.

The second reason I'm so pleased to be here is because I get the opportunity to engage with an audience that is expert, informed and distinguished.

And, of course, that's pretty much par for the course at the Athenaeum Club.

After all, yours is an institution that can open up its two hundred year old membership books and see names like Charles Dickens and Rudyard Kipling, Charles Darwin and Barnes Wallis, Lord Palmerston and Winston Churchill.

I understand that even the Duke of Wellington was a Club member at one time.

And it was the Iron Duke himself who gave this unforgettable advice about public speaking - ""Don't quote Latin, say what you have to say and then sit down.""

So, while doing my best to stick to Wellington's advice - especially the bit about quoting Latin - tonight I'll be speaking about ""equations"".

Well, to be accurate, one equation in particular. I can see a few raised eyebrows. Don't panic, I promise that you won't have to sit through a mathematics' lecture.

Instead, the equation I want to talk about is one that drives my policy approach at the DfT, and it's this - good transport equals good economics.

## A race to win the future

Just as the Athenaeum has been down the decades, Britain is home to inventors and innovators, builders and creators.

Entrepreneurs opening businesses, creating jobs and spreading prosperity.

Researchers analysing problems and devising solutions.

Engineers pushing the limits of design, scientists pushing the boundaries of discovery.

And companies turning out some of the best products on the planet.

These are all vital components of our national capital and they are the equal of any in the world.

But while all of this should give us hope about Britain's future, it should not give us rest.

In the modern global economy there is a race to win the future and complacency will mean we end up being left behind in the starting blocks.

Like they say, if you snooze, you lose.

So, this Government deliberately set itself the task of building a Britain that is ready and able to go up against the global competition, and win.

## Re-booting, re-energising & re-balancing the economy

But, right from day one in office, we understood that you can't build a better future on the quick sands of inherited debt.

Instead, you need to sink your foundations into the rock-solid ground of fiscal discipline.

That's why we're sticking to our deficit reduction plan. Paying down the inherited debt, winning credibility in the markets and keeping interest rates low.

We also have a laser focus on making this the best place in the world to start, finance and grow a business.

So we're removing the shackles that hold our entrepreneurs and wealth creators back.

Freeing them up, giving them room to succeed by reforming employment laws and modernising the planning regulations.

We're knocking down the barriers of rules of out-dated and unnecessary rules too.

I want to see better regulation, not more regulation, which is why I back a ""one in, one out"" rule and the ""Red Tape Challenge"".

We're easing access to credit and bringing down the costs of borrowing for small businesses with our National Loan Guarantee Scheme.

And, we're cutting Corporation Tax as well... down from 26 per cent to 24 per cent this month, to 23 per cent in April 2013 and then down to 22 per cent by April 2014.

So we're putting in place the conditions of long-term stability by re-booting and re-energising our economy.

But we're working hard to re-balance the economy as well.

Yes of course, we recognise and value Britain's role as the world's leading financial centre - a role we're committed to safeguarding.

But these islands were once the workshop of the world and it's time to be a nation of manufacturers, innovators and exporters once again.

More and more products around the world stamped with the words ""Made in Britain"" that's our ambition.

Shifting UK Plc from a ""spend and borrow"" past to a ""make and sell"" future, that's our goal.

## A straightforward equation

A strong and stable economy is an essential ingredient for Britain's future success.

But, as the Prime Minster recently argued, the infrastructure deficit we inherited is as serious as the budget deficit that was left to us.

And infrastructure matters.

It's the thread that makes possible our journeys to work, delivers light when we flick the switch and provides the connections that made the communications revolution.

In believe that if this country is to out-produce, out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world, then it also needs infrastructure fit for the 21st century. And that includes the transport networks that are so crucial to our economic future.

But that's not just my view.

The British Chambers of Commerce say that ""infrastructure is the lifeblood of British business""

The CBI say ""there are large amounts of business capital waiting to be unlocked if the government achieves a step-change on transport""

And the Institute of Directors say it is ""essential to provide more and better transport infrastructure in order to sustain the UK's competitiveness""

I couldn't agree more:

  * Cutting congestion and speeding up journey times.
  * Moving people and products faster and more reliably
  * And making sure Britain is plugged into the global market place

That's how you power up the recovery and put people back to work.

We cannot afford to sit back and look on while other countries invest in world class transport networks.

In the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, in the Middle East and Africa - even in the United States and the European Union - nation after nation is upgrading and expanding their infrastructure.

Every bridge they repair, every road they improve and every rail track they lay drives their growth and increases their prosperity.

Today over-stretched and outmoded infrastructure just won't cut it. They cost British businesses and British families time and money, it's as simple as that.

As I said at the start, for me it's a straightforward equation - good transport equals good economics.

So we too must invest in and modernise our transport networks. And that's precisely what this Government is doing.

## A different choice

Now, to be honest, the easy choice faced with the debt and deficit we inherited, would have been to cut capital spending and major infrastructure projects.

But we made a different choice. A deliberate decision to invest in our transport infrastructure - from huge multi-billion projects like Crossrail, to small interventions that make a big difference, like encouraging more people to cycle.

Take last year's Spending Review - over £30 billion for road, rail and local transport across the country.

We set up the £560 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund, giving local communities more power to design and deliver local transport schemes.

Last year's Autumn Statement unveiled a multi-billion pound investment package in which transport took centre-stage.

And, in this year's Budget, the Chancellor again announced investments designed to improve our country's transport links. These include:

  * £150 million for our Growing Places Fund to boost economic growth, jobs and house-building;
  * £15 million for Cycle Safety Infrastructure for TfL to reduce the rate of collisions and encourage an increase in cycling in London
  * And £11 million for Low Carbon Buses to help build a cleaner and greener Britain.

In the Budget we also announced our support for Network Rail to invest a further £130 million in the Northern Hub rail schemes - funding that means passengers in the great counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire will enjoy better connections, faster services and more seats.

## HS2 decision

This Government made a different choice about transport investment because we were looking well beyond the horizon.

Taking decisions to improve our national well-being, not just for the next four or five years, but for the next four or five decades.

And not in spite of the economic challenges we face, but as a means to overcome them.

It's that same long-term national interest which motivated my recent decision to give the go-ahead to HS2 - a national high speed rail network

HS2 will slash journey times, shrink our country and radically improve the connections between our cities and regions.

It will help to create jobs and generate growth, promote social mobility and spread prosperity.

And I want the whole country to share in those HS2 benefits. Which is why I recently went up to Scotland and spoke to the Scottish Government about how speed rail can work for communities and businesses north of the border.

## We're doing more... much more

Our work to update and upgrade Britain's transport infrastructure doesn't begin and end with high speed rail. We're doing more, much more, to get Britain moving.

We're investing in our conventional railways - from new stations and new rolling stock, to electrifying more lines it all adds up to the biggest modernisation programme since Victorian times.

And, hand-in-hand with extra resources for our railways goes reform of our railways. So I've just published a Rail Command Paper setting set out our vision for an efficient, effective and value for money rail industry. Reforms that will put the customer first.

We're investing in our roads too, improving these arteries of trade and freight, whether it's by unlocking extra capacity through our managed motorway schemes, or it's through easing congestion by widening the Kettering Bypass.

We won't improve our roads through individual projects alone - as important as they are. So we're developing a comprehensive national roads strategy.

We will also carry out a feasibility study into new ownership and financing models for the national road network and report progress in the autumn.

We'll be looking at where we can learn lessons from other industries, and building on the proposals in Alan Cook's report on the Highways Agency.

Improving our quality of life and enhancing our economic prospects also means modernising transport at the local level.

Nearly all journeys start, or end, on local transport networks. And those journeys can shape your entire day, for better or for worse.

It only takes a late bus, a packed train or a congested road and a short commute becomes an endurance test and a good day turns into a bad one.

So, when it comes to transport, local matters.

And, because it matters so much, I've unblocked overdue major road schemes.

Indeed, just before Christmas I gave the green light to a further 21 projects, all together adding up to an investment in our road network worth £854 million.

## Island nation, trading nation

Britain is not just an island nation - we are a trading nation. So our ports must be world class global gateways.

That's why we're backing major container port developments like Liverpool, Bathside Bay, Felixstowe South, London Gateway, Teesport and the Port of Bristol.

It's also why we want to see a successful and sustainable future for that other crucial global gateway, our aviation industry.

We should remember that our country and our capital are right up there with the very best when it comes to international connections.

Only China and the USA have aviation networks more extensive than ours.

Not France. Not Germany. Not South Korea. Not any of our main economic competitors.

We are directly connected to 356 international destinations. And no European country can match our connections to the world's great commercial centres.

Over nine thousand flights every year to New York, three thousand to Hong Kong, two thousand five hundred to Singapore.

To each of these important destinations, and many others, Britain is the market leader.

So, right now, this country is very definitely in aviation's global premier league.

None-the-less, if we are to maintain that high flying status then we have to take on the tough challenges facing the industry - whether it's improving the passenger experience, or it's enhancing capacity and connectivity while tackling the industry's impacts on climate change and the local environment.

So we've been working on a call for evidence on the options for maintaining the UK's status as an international hub for aviation.

This document, alongside our overarching aviation framework, will help define the future of UK aviation for decades to come and it is crucial that we get this right.

We remain committed to having a final policy in place by next spring at the latest, but we have taken the decision to wait until both documents are ready and intend to publish them in the summer.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, tonight I have argued that good transport equals good economics.

I recognise that, as an equation, it is certainly uncomplicated.

But I also believe that it is absolutely undeniable.

Quite simply, an economy built for success requires transport networks built to last.

Time-warp transport would leave us a time-warp Britain - a country stuck in the past, rooted in the global slow lane.

That's why we need to invest in our transport networks... renew, rebuild and reform to make them the best that they can be.

And, while I'm Transport Secretary, that's exactly what we'll continue to do.

Okay, I think it's high time I brought my contribution to the proceedings to a close.

And I'd like to sign off with an announcement.

It's something that not too many people know, and it's this... I'm a committed and unashamed Marxist.

Now, before that shocking revelation reaches the Chief Whip, let me point out that I'm actually a Groucho Marxist.

And, as only he could, Groucho Marx once joked - ""I have had a perfectly wonderful evening... but this wasn't it.""

Well I too have had a perfectly wonderful evening and this WAS it.

So it just remains for me to say a big thank-you - for inviting me along, for listening to what I had to say and for making me feel so welcome.

",Transcript,justine-greening,"Athenaeum Club, After Dinner Speech",Department for Transport,,,,,02/04/2012,,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/villiers-20120418a,Transport Times Aviation Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Minister of State for Transport.","Thank you David. This is a key conference at a crucial time for Britain's aviation sector.

I know how difficult the past few years have been for many in the industry.

With challenges like rising oil prices, a turbulent global economy, and a ruthlessly competitive marketplace have all taken their toll.

But paradoxically, the economic downturn has also made us appreciate, even more than before, the immense contribution that aviation makes to our country.

I'm sure it's a familiar figure to many when I say, the sector generates around £9bn of output each year and of course plays a crucial role in providing our gateway to the global marketplace.

And in the year of the Olympic Games and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, we are reminded of the critical role that aviation plays in supporting tourism, and making London such a popular destination.

But the very success of our aviation sector also presents us with a series of key challenges, these centre around:

... how to accommodate growth while meeting our environmental commitments and addressing the quality of life impact of aircraft noise...

... how to improve our airports and the passenger experience...

... and how to protect Britain's position as one of the best connected countries in the world.

Above all, the debate on the future of our airports must be grounded in reality and based on the facts. The reality is that Britain has an extensive and highly successful global aviation network.

Arguably, London is the most well connected city in the world.

It has five highly successful and busy airports... six if you include Southend and some would also like to see Manston to play a role in meeting our aviation capacity needs as well.

The London airport network provides direct links to around 350 international destinations, including most of the world's greatest commercial centres.

Heathrow delivers over 9000 flights every year to New York making the UK the market leader in Europe, on this route.

2500 to Singapore and New Delhi make us market leaders here too.

Then there's China.

Like the rest of the Westminster village... I've read on the escalators at Westminster tube station that we're lagging behind in this important market...

... lagging behind unless, that is, we include the 3000 flights every year to Hong Kong.

If we do that... it's clear that in this market too, we lead with Heathrow delivering more services to China than any of its continental rivals.

And frankly I don't think my colleagues in the Foreign Office would thank me if I started acting on the assumption, as some people seem to, that Hong Kong **wasn't** a part of China!

So while it is true that Heathrow is pretty much full and Gatwick too is approaching capacity... it's simply not the case that London's connectivity is falling off a cliff edge.

But good government is not just about tackling the problems of today... it is also about planning for the future.

In the same way that we are not prepared to leave future generations with a fiscal deficit, neither should we leave them with an infrastructure deficit.

So it is right that we have the debate about our capacity and connectivity needs over the years and decades to come.

That is why the Chancellor announced in his Autumn statement that we would explore all the options for maintaining the UK's aviation hub status with the exception of a third runway at Heathrow.

The Coalition has always been clear that it does not support a third runway at Heathrow.

One of its very first acts as a Government was to confirm this.

Heathrow is unique in Europe in terms of the magnitude of the noise impact it has on densely populated areas.

The airport accounts for approximately 70 per cent of people in the UK exposed to average noise from airports above 55 decibels.

More than one in four people exposed to this level of noise around European airports lives near Heathrow.

Thousands live on a daily basis with a plane overhead every 90 seconds... not to mention the flights that wake them up at 4.30am.

The quality of life impact of a third runway, with up to 220,000 more flights over London every year, would be massive and there is no technological solution in sight to ensure planes become quiet enough quickly enough to make this burden in any way tolerable.

So we need another solution... and last year we kicked off the process to **decide what that will be** with the publication of our scoping document on a sustainable future for aviation.

Responses came from a wide range of industry and environmental stakeholders, members of the public and community and campaigning groups. I'd like to thank those who took part.

We are using them to inform the drafting of our consultation document on a sustainable future for aviation.

We are also developing a call for evidence on maintaining the UK's hub airport capacity.

These two documents will be published in the Summer... a little later than planned... but we remain committed to finalising policy framework by next spring as we originally promised.

I know some would like us to go faster but this decision is a crucial one which requires an objective, thorough and evidence based analysis of our connectivity needs and how best to meet them in a sustainable way.

A thorough assessment of the environmental impact of potential solutions will also, of course, be crucial.

As the Coalition has said from the start... we want aviation to grow... but growth at any price and without regard for the environmental consequences would not be in the nation's best interests.

Aviation needs to play its part in meeting our carbon commitments and protecting the quality of life of local communities.

As well as asking the right environmental questions... we need to ask the right economic ones as well.

It's worth noting that **connectivity** is the crucial outcome we want to secure and that connectivity and capacity aren't always synonymous.

For example, the last time capacity was increased at Heathrow was when the Terminal 5 planning consent raised the movement cap to 480,000 flights per year.

But when capacity went up, the number of destinations actually fell because of an increasing emphasis on trans-Atlantic routes.

Conversely... while additional capacity **can** certainly improve connectivity... it is not the only means of doing this.

Another option is to make better use of the airports we have by using them more efficiently and by seeking to focus our hub capacity on the routes that are of the greatest importance to the economy as a whole and which will contribute most to the continuing success of Heathrow as one of the world's most popular hub airports.

But I do acknowledge that the DfT's latest published demand forecasts do indicate that airports in the south east are likely to be full by around 2030 with increasingly significant crowding pressure by the mid 2020s... even if regional airports start to shoulder more of the load.

Given how long it takes to deliver new capacity... we do need to start preparing now for those longer term challenges... though it should be acknowledged that demand forecasts are presented as a range and can change as key assumptions about economic growth and oil prices are varied. So there is an element of uncertainty here.

Nor... I'm afraid... would it be right for me to stand here and pre-judge the outcome of the detailed and evidence-based decision-making process we started on with our scoping document and which we will continue with the documents we're publishing in the Summer.

The experience of the last Government shows what a tangled web you can weave if you start out with one outcome in mind and seek to reverse engineer the evidence to deliver it.

But whichever solution is ultimately chosen... delivery is likely to span across more than one Parliament.

That is why the Secretary of State and her predecessor have both expressed an interest and willingness to seek cross-party consensus.

There is no doubt that the degree of cross-party support which has been established for HS2 is making the high speed rail project easier to deliver than it otherwise would be.

In taking the process forward to determine the right solution to the UK's long term aviation connectivity needs... we'll consider very carefully how we can take the politics out of the debate and seek common ground with others.

But I would emphasise that our focus on the longer term is not distracting us from the action we're taking to improve our airports right now and make the best possible use of our current capacity.

Legislation is going through Parliament to deliver a new system of economic regulation that will put the passenger interest firmly at the heart of the regulatory system and create the right incentives for investment in the improvements that customers want.

The licence based approach we are proposing will help the CAA intervene more quickly and more effectively if an airport is failing its customers than waiting for a 5 yearly price review.

We are also pressing ahead with measures that emerged from our South East Airports Taskforce.

These include reform of the aviation security regime... moving it away from the prescriptive approach of today towards what we have called ""an outcome-focused, risk-based"" system. Which I think would bring significant improvement.

We're now consulting on those changes, which would give airport operators more flexibility on how to meet security standards.

We are confident that the new approach can deliver the same high standards as today... or possibly higher... but will enable these outcomes to be delivered in a more passenger friendly and efficient way by harnessing the ideas and expertise of the airport operators who actually deliver these services on the front line and enabling them to integrate more seamlessly into operations at the airport.

A further important initiative that emerged from the work of the taskforce is the tactical use of greater operational freedoms at Heathrow.

A trial of these measures commenced in November and they include the use of both runways for arrivals in certain prescribed circumstances.

We believe these freedoms could potentially deliver operational benefits by improving punctuality.

They could also provide environmental benefits by reducing the number of late running night-flights and reducing aircraft stacking.

We believe the trial will provide a sound factual basis on which to assess the impacts and benefits of theses operational freedoms being trialled.

A full consultation with local communities will take place after the end of phase 2 of the trial to enable us to decide whether any of these new operational freedoms should go beyond the trial stage to become long term changes to the way Heathrow operates.

A fourth key initiative for improving our airports is harnessing the latest technology to modernise airspace management through the CAA's Future Airspace Strategy and the Single European Sky programme run by the European Union.

This is a priority for the Government and one which is starting to make some real progress.

A fundamental part of the SES programme is the establishment of functional airspace blocks.

By running airspace in bigger blocks which combine a number of countries, we can increase capacity, reduce fuel consumption, mitigate noise and improve safety.

The UK and Irish functional airspace block was the first to start operations and is already delivering practical benefits.

Fifthly and lastly - we are delivering a step change in the quality of the surface access links to a number of our busiest airports.

Manchester airport is going to be linked up to the Metrolink tram network for the first time and funding has been secured for a new Airport Link Road connecting with the M56 and A6.

Thameslink will significantly improve rail connectivity to Luton and Gatwick.

Phase one of HS2 will provide a top class interchange with Birmingham airport and phase two to Manchester and Leeds will bring the airport within an hour's travel time for the majority of the UK population.

Phase two will also give millions of people in the Midlands and the North a direct high speed rail route to Heathrow for the first time. The long awaited tube upgrade will improve London Underground services to Heathrow and a quarter of a century after the project was first mooted.. *Crossrail construction is now underway**.

Two huge tunnel boring machines will soon be starting their journey under central London, delivering that crucial direct link between Heathrow and the global financial powerhouse in the City and Canary Wharf.

So ladies and gentlemen... we're taking a range of actions right now to ensure our airports continue to provide top class international gateways to the rest of the world.

And we're also carrying out the process needed to determine our future connectivity needs and how we meet them in a sustainable way.

This is an immensely important debate and I would urge all of you to take part when the call for evidence and consultation documents are published.

Thank for taking time to listen to what I've had to say on these key issues for our economy, our environment and our country.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20120425a,Intelligent Mobility Summit,"Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening Remarks

Thank you for that kind introduction - and I'd like to thank the Automotive Council for all the work that you've put in to organise this summit.

It is a real pleasure to see so many experts and distinguished professionals from a wide range of backgrounds and disciplines come together to share ideas on the future of mobility.

This is a debate with massive implications for the future of our economy, and the future of our country.

So I'm honoured to be here and to be taking part in today's event.

## Transport and its impact on the UK

As a nation we are placing seemingly ever-increasing demands on our transport system.

And that's because transport is a great enabler.

As individuals, it helps us live our lives; enjoy our leisure time; achieve our goals; and expand our horizons.

But it's also key to economic growth.

Providing the arteries through which commerce flows.

Linking commuters with the workplace and goods with the marketplace

Consumers rightly want transport that is safer, cleaner and greener. They want less congestion and more reliability. And, however they are travelling, they want transport that is seamless, truly integrated and makes the best use of their time.

'Intelligent mobility' can make this a reality.

Not merely by delivering a more dynamic, efficient and integrated transport system... but also by transforming the travel experience, and increasing the value of time spent on the move.

It offers a huge opportunity to provide a step change in delivering a quality service for customers, by building transport around the user and around the passenger.

## The Challenge

The positive potential of intelligent transport cannot be exaggerated. But neither should we underestimate the challenges ahead.

Boosted by continued population growth, a rise in GDP, more prosperous consumers, and more affordable motoring, we estimate that road-user demand will rise by around 35% over the next 20 years.

In one sense, this can be seen as a positive because rising demand means our economy is continuing to grow.

But, at the same time, sustaining the performance of our road systems will become increasingly difficult.

To achieve the economic growth that is so crucial to Britain's future prosperity, we cannot afford to allow our transport arteries to clog up.

So we must be prepared to accommodate rising demand for road space while hitting our carbon reduction targets.

We need to base our strategy around the multi-faceted expectations of the customer.

And at a time of limited public resources, we need to explore new and innovative ways of funding improvements to road transport.

## What Government is doing

So we are clear that Britain needs a modern road network fit for the 21st century - one that drives growth, jobs and prosperity.

That means investing in parts of the infrastructure where we can deliver the best value and benefits to businesses and road users.

We're already investing over £1 billion to tackle areas of congestion and improve the national road network, and spending £500m on local schemes. That's on top of the £2.3 billion planned investment in major roads announced in the Spending Review.

And my Department is working with the Treasury to look at new ways to fund roads in the longer term - such as attracting more private sector involvement through new ownership and financing models.

But a fresh approach to investment is only part of the solution.

We also need a smarter road network - one that can adapt to future changes in society and technology. A more intelligent system to make better use of capacity, both on roads and public transport.

And again, our priority here is not only to improve the way that transport networks are managed, but also to build change around the user, transforming the travel experience.

New technologies offer enormous opportunities to address both concerns.

There are also huge gains on offer for UK-based businesses if we get this right.

We are already a recognised global leader in developing transport technologies. We have the knowledge, facilities and experience to lead the world in making intelligent mobility come to life.

To take advantage of this capability, we need to foster strong links between different parts of the transport industry with technology providers, academia, and the engineering sector.

Looking round this room today, the Automotive Council is an excellent example of how you are working co-operatively to deliver a shared vision for the future.

And I see our role in Government as very clear.

We have to free you up to do the job you're best at - focusing on your customers, understanding their changing needs and innovating.

We have to provide the right support structure for the private sector to deliver.

And that's something we are working on across the Coalition, as highlighted in the recent Budget, where the Chancellor set out plans to make the UK the technology hub of Europe.

For instance, by establishing two new Catapult Centres for Transport Systems and Future Cities - which can create a critical mass for research - we will support collaboration between leading UK businesses, innovators and academics to bring new technologies to market, attract inward investment, reduce congestion, and support economic growth

## Industry Leadership

But we depend on industry expertise to deliver this work. And I am proud to say that the UK is well-placed to drive forward the Automotive Council's vision.

We are home to one of the most diverse, efficient, innovative and high-tech motor industries in the world.

I'm proud that Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover, and BMW - among others - all have major manufacturing facilities here.

But we also have a thriving motorsport industry; perhaps the most sophisticated fleet sector in the world; and a strong supplier base.

Our country's history shows a magnificent motor industry heritage. But the real strength of Britain's modern motor industry is that it's looking forward, not back.

And that gives me confidence that we here in the UK can lead a global revolution in smarter transport and intelligent mobility.

Industry is already stepping up to the challenge in many ways:

  * Improving the way traffic is managed - and we're already using some of this technology as part of our Olympics transport programme
  * Bringing low carbon passenger and commercial vehicles to market
  * And exploiting the opportunities offered by digital technologies to change the way you communicate and interact with the consumer.

Just consider the extraordinary range of services that an organisation like Transport for London is able to offer through its website and smart-phone apps today compared with a few years ago.

Travellers in the capital can access live traffic and Tube information; top up their Oyster Smartcards; check their Boris Bike availability; pay for the Congestion Charge; get directions to the nearest parking space; book a taxi; and - perhaps best of all - find out when their next bus is arriving.

Rail users can now get a first app with real time train journey information down to each station and even each platform.

Over the next few years, web-based technologies will increasingly give individuals the ability to start tailoring their journeys as they like. That's going to change the way that transport providers see the market and deliver their services.

And actually, that's something we've seen in other areas of the business world.

Take an early innovation that has become routine - the Tesco Club Card... an idea that has changed shopping and supermarkets for good.

This piece of simple but effective technology empowered the shopper. But, by allowing Tesco to analyse shopping behaviour, it also enabled them to develop strategies that could best exploit customer segmentation. In other words, it worked for the business too.

Another good example of industry taking the lead was the SatNav summit - run by ITS (UK) and ADEPT - which the DfT hosted in March.

While the SatNav has transformed the way we navigate around towns and cities, there is clearly potential to further improve the flow of information to customers over the next few years.

Nevertheless, as we become increasingly reliant on SatNavs and smartphones to find our way around, so the consequences of any glitch in the technology, or in the information fed into the system, become more serious.

So the information going into SatNavs must be accurate and up to date. But the places they help us navigate to, our towns and cities, are not places that never change.

New retail and housing developments alter the street network. New traffic lights are built. New weight and height restrictions come into force on a road. So the information needs to be supplied as quickly and seamlessly as possible.

The reputations of the SatNav supplier, or even the car manufacturer, can't help but be linked to the flow of information provided by a wide range of sources... from local councils to the Highways Agency.

And there are SatNav user groups who also have a critical interest in the debate... freight companies, for example, taxi firms, and fleets.

So here again, collaboration between different public and private sector organisations is absolutely key to improving the customer experience.

To make the most of the opportunities that technology can offer, industry cannot deliver this vision alone. You need to work in partnership with Government if you're to thrive.

We can open up new sources of data, and that's exactly what we are doing with our transparency agenda - from providing information on MoTs to streetworks and road accidents.

We can also create incentives, such as the £30 million Plugged-in Places programme, offering match-funding to consortia to encourage the development of plug-in vehicle recharging infrastructure across the UK.

And we can improve access to European Research Funding, and work to lift the burdens of red tape on business.

## Roads strategy

This is a timely debate, because the Department has recently started work on a new Roads Strategy, to be published towards the end of the year, as recommended by Alan Cook's independent review of the Strategic Road Network.

Our objective is to set clear, long-term goals for the network and help deliver a 'horizon shift' in our aspirations for such a key, significant national asset.

Our focus will be on maintaining performance to support economic growth; to reduce environmental impacts; and to support the safety and security of road users.

Technology will influence and sometimes transform the way we approach each of these issues, and will therefore be of critical importance in the development of the new strategy.

Your thinking on this will be invaluable, and we hope that over the coming months you will engage with the Department and help us shape our plans.

Today is a perfect opportunity to start thinking about this. So before I finish I'd like to suggest three challenges that I hope will help focus your thoughts.

First - in terms of challenge and opportunities, what are the long-term outcomes that we want to achieve? Where are users and consumers going to be? It's not just about capacity, as you know, it's about the quality of journeys and provision too. what are those needs?

Second - looking at the range of solutions, what are the technologies that will drive economic growth and help make the most of capacity, but deliver the best experience too on our transport network and how can we better understand their benefits?

And finally - how can we take forward momentum from today's event, to improve collaboration and actually deliver meaningful results?

## Looking ahead

If I can sum up, together, government and industry have made great progress towards addressing problems of safety, pollution and fuel consumption.

We have helped make Britain's roads among the safest in the world. And we are on the cusp of a further transformation in road safety with the development of virtually un-crashable cars by 2030.

And we're making great headway on the environmental impact of road transport. Improvements in fuel efficiency and the development of hybrid and electric vehicles mean that, despite an increase in traffic, CO2 emissions are set to fall significantly over the next 25 years.

But perhaps our biggest challenge, given its economic, environmental and social cost, is making sure we tackle congestion.

That means we all need to focus on solutions - be they managing demand, enabling travellers to make more informed decisions about their journeys, and making the best use of existing networks and capacity.

But despite the complexity and size of the task ahead, I'm convinced that we are on the road to an exciting future - one in which innovative solutions can make a huge difference.

At a time when technology is changing so rapidly - perhaps faster than at any time since the invention of the internal combustion engine - we have a tremendous opportunity to develop a more intelligent road transport strategy.

To grasp this opportunity, we have to exploit our shared know-how and experience. We have to invest in areas that offer the biggest potential benefits. And we have to put the customer at the heart of our work.

Follow these principles and I'm convinced that we can meet our shared objectives.

Thank-you.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20120426b,Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMECHE),"Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening remarks

Thank you for that introduction.

Thank you also for asking me along. This is an important event, debating an important subject, and so I'm delighted to be here today.

Now I know you have a packed schedule, so I'll do my best to keep things brief.

And, what I'd like to do this morning is give you a sense of why I think HS2 matters critically for Britain's future - why this is a project whose time has very definitely come.

## 1825, 2025, 2026

Ours is the country that gave the world the railways.

But, if Victorian Britain was the 19th century midwife to rail travel, then it was the mechanical engineer, and former President of this very Institution, George Stephenson who was surely its father.

Back in 1825 it was Stephenson - one of the greatest of our Victorian forebears - who built the first steam locomotives. And it was Stephenson who ran them on the first public railway.

Those trains, and that line, covered little more than two dozen miles between Stockton and Darlington, but they started a process that would change our world forever.

2025 will be the year we celebrate the bicentenary of that incredible achievement - two centuries since the story of rail began.

But 2026 will be the year we start writing a new chapter in that story. Because that's when we aim to have the first trains speeding along HS2's tracks.

## A different future

For Britain, high speed rail will be a transport quantum leap.

In many other countries it's already a well established form of travel.

In fact, it is forty seven years since Japan launched the world's first commercial high speed rail service.

And its famous Bullet Trains proved to be so popular and successful they were carrying a hundred million passengers within three years.

Since then, high speed networks have sprung up across the Far East and Western Europe.

And new lines are being built in nations as diverse as the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil.

So, set against this international reality, the choices I faced when I took up my job as Transport Secretary were pretty straight forward:

  * Do we go for growth, or do we settle for stagnation?
  * Do we take this once in a generation chance, or do we lose it forever?

And, for me, the facts were crystal clear - self-imposed exile from this global transport revolution made no sense whatsoever.

Do that and it would be our cities, our businesses and our travelling public losing out, and looking on, as others embraced high speed rail - enjoying, and exploiting, its social, economic and environmental benefits.

To compete and win in the modern world Britain needs to aim for a different future. So, in January, I gave the green-light to HS2.

Answering that ""should we"" ""shouldn't we"" question on HS2 naturally raises other important questions.

For example, when will it be up and running? What will it look like? How much of a difference could it make? So let me try to address some of the key strategic issues around the project.

## National network, two phases

The first thing to say is that HS2 will be a truly national high speed rail network built in two phases.

Phase 1 will link London to the West Midlands, plus a direct connection to the Continent through the Channel Tunnel via High Speed 1. And it's worth noting that more than half of the route will be in cuttings or tunnels to mitigate the visual and noise impacts.

HS2 trains will run directly onto the existing network - which means that, even in this initial phase, it will offer faster journeys to destinations in the North West and Scotland.

Phase 2 will provide onward legs to Manchester and Leeds, with intermediate stations in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire, plus a direct connection to our international hub, Heathrow Airport.

In the coming weeks and months I'll be considering HS2 Ltd's route and station advice for this second phase. I intend to publish that advice in the autumn, together with a Government response.

I also want the whole country to share in HS2's benefits, which is why I recently went up to Scotland and spoke to the Scottish Government about how high speed rail can work for communities and businesses north of the border.

As I said earlier, the date we've set ourselves for completion of Phase 1 is 2026. And, by 2033, we expect Phase 2 to be finished.

## What a high speed Britain could look like

Together, these two phases will add up to a Y-shaped network that's around 330 miles long.

And just think about the potential positive impact of that network, about what a high speed Britain could look like.

The most obvious change is that journey times between our cities and regions will have been slashed and connectivity radically improved:

  * London to Birmingham: 45 minutes instead of the current 1 hour 24 minutes
  * Birmingham to Manchester: just 41 minutes, rather than the hour and a half it takes now. Birmingham to Liverpool down to a hour from 1 hour 34 minutes
  * And Birmingham to Leeds: a trip of 57 minutes, as opposed to the 2 hours it takes today

High speed trains will also be high capacity trains - up to 18 an hour in each direction with up to 1,100 seats.

So, not only will HS2 mean better connected communities and better served passengers, it will also free up a huge amount of extra space for freight and commuters on the conventional rail network.

And that's a massively important HS2 bonus

Because, yes, in the Spending Review we committed £18 billion worth of investment to improve our conventional railways - the biggest modernisation programme since Queen Victoria sat on the throne.

But our scope for squeezing ever-more capacity out of our existing rail infrastructure is diminishing.

Just look at the passenger figures.

Demand for long-distance rail travel has doubled over the past 15 years and there are now over 1.4 billion rail journeys on the rail network a year.

What's more, up-grading existing major North-South lines would only provide a short term fix, and would consign passengers to years of disruption, delays and misery.

That's what makes HS2 so much more than a way to provide faster and better journeys for those travelling on the high speed network.

With the capacity it unlocks, it's actually the key to meeting the demand challenge and transforming rail services for every passenger.

HS2 will also help breathe new life into our towns and cities.

And that's because high speed rail stations will be at the heart of urban across the country, acting like a catalyst to local development, galvanising businesses, generating innovation and driving forward renewal.

Thanks to HS2 tens of thousands of jobs - direct and indirect - will have been created and sustained by the building, on-going maintenance and day-to-day running of the network.

We think that the construction and operation of Phase 1 alone will support something like 40,000 jobs.

And, of course, HS2 will mean much wider job opportunities, not least of all for engineering, technology and infrastructure specialists, and the firms and businesses that make up the supply chain.

Many are already helping us deliver Crossrail, Thameslink, electrification and upgrades to major stations like Reading and Birmingham. But even the largest of these schemes will be dwarfed in size by HS2.

So I want to see British companies, with their world-beating skills and expertise - the kind of qualities that IMECHE and its members are famous for - competing for key high speed contracts. Britain's best helping us deliver HS2 on time and on budget.

Actually, on the way over here this morning I was reminded that IMECHE - along with its virtual next door neighbour the Institution of Civil Engineers - is located right in the heart of Government... a stone's throw from the Treasury in fact.

And that's no accident. Your founders chose this spot for their impressive headquarters because they lived in an age when modernising this country's infrastructure was seen as a top political priority.

Well, as HS2 shows, under this Government, it is again.

I am convinced that HS2 will give a huge boost to families and businesses up and down the country - to our individual quality of life and our collective well-being.

For starters it will enhance social mobility, giving choices and opportunities to millions of people.

But it will also help to re-boot and re-balance our economy.

All of Britain will be open for business as companies and entrepreneurs across the regions use HS2 to exploit new markets, win new customers and attract new investment.

And high speed rail could even be good for the environment, with its potential to encourage a modal shift of people and goods away from long-distance car use and short haul aviation.

## Beyond a simple benefit-cost ratio

HS2 makes sound financial sense too.

We estimate the full Y network will cost £32.7 billion to build (in 2011 prices) and that it will generate benefits of up to £47 billion and fare revenues of up to £34 billion.

So the HS2 sums add up.

But let's be clear, the economic case for this project goes way beyond a simple benefit-cost ratio.

Yes, there will be a welcome return on the money invested in HS2.

But the real economic gains will be seen in the way a national high speed rail network helps to support job creation and stimulate the economy, improve connectivity and increase capacity, and make Britain's competitive edge razor sharp.

The plain truth is that the price of not going ahead with HS2 far outweighs the cost of building it.

In short, high speed rail matters for our country's success and our children's future.

## Concluding remarks

From its size and scale, to the positive difference it will make, HS2 is a landmark transport project.

So I recognise that this is huge project; a challenge that's as big as they come; and a genuine test of our energy, commitment and skills.

But, when I look at the ""wow factor"" renovations of stations like St Pancras and Kings Cross; when I see the way in which these railway hubs have been transformed and restored to their Victorian splendour; I know it's a test we are equal to.

I also know that Britain has been here before.

As I said at the start of my speech, we are the heirs of giants like George Stephenson; the inventors and innovators who gave us the railways; the Victorian forebears whose vision and determination transformed this country's fortunes.

And, half a century ago jobs, growth and opportunity got a decades' long shot in the arm when another generation had the vision to plan and construct the motorway network.

Today, we can no more turn our backs on the positive potential of high-speed rail than these earlier generations could have opted out of the steam age; or condemned this nation to a slow-lane future without motorways.

Like them, we cannot simply hope for a better and more prosperous future- like them we must, and we will, build it.

Thank you.

Thank you for that introduction David (David Frost LEP Network Chair)

Thank you also for asking me along.

This is an important conference focused on important issues... and so I'm delighted to be here today.

And one brief glance at the Conference Programme is proof enough that you have a packed schedule and busy day. So I promise not to take up too much of your valuable time.

In fact, when it comes to making speeches, I'm always conscious of the wise words of the 19th century politician Lord Reading whose sage advice to public speakers was ""Always be shorter than anybody dared to hope"".

## Local Matters

I've been in my job for some six months now.

And, one of the things that's really struck me is the extent to which the transport debate can be dominated by ""the national""

The big-ticket items and large-scale infrastructure; the policies and projects; those pieces of the transport jig-saw with a genuine nationwide significance

And I suppose that's only to be expected.

After all, something like HS2 - a rail modernisation that will transform Britain's social and economic geography - is bound to generate headlines and grab people's attention from one end of the country to the other.

But the other thing you quickly learn in this job is that ""local"" matters hugely.

It matters because nearly all journeys start, or end, on local transport networks. And those journeys can shape your entire day, for better or for worse.

It only takes a late bus, a packed train or a congested road and a short commute becomes an endurance test and a good day turns into a bad one.

In other words, there is a direct relationship between the quality of local transport and the quality of our individual lives.

But it also has a wider impact on us all.

And that's because an effective and efficient local transport system is the bedrock of a successful and sustainable local economy.

Whether it's getting products into our shops and onto the shelves, or connecting businesses with the market-place and employees with the work-place, local buses, trains and roads are essential economic ingredients.

## Getting local transport right

What does all that mean?

Well, it means this Government has a laser focus on getting local transport right.

Investing in it, reforming and modernising it. From day one in office these have been first order priorities for us.

And let me walk you through just a few of the things we've been doing.

Our £560 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund will give communities more power to design and deliver local transport schemes; while our £770 million Growing Places Fund will help to help kick-start infrastructure projects.

In the Autumn Statement the Chancellor announced 20 local authority major transport schemes. And, just before Christmas, I gave the green light for a further 21 local majors. That's an investment package worth £854 million.

And, in this year's Budget, the Chancellor again announced investments designed to improve local transport links.

These ranged from £15 million for Cycle Safety in London, to supporting Network Rail to invest a further £130 million in the Northern Hub rail schemes

We've reformed as well, simplifying funding by cutting the number of separate local transport grant streams from 26 to just four.

But we're cutting red tape too. For example, by freeing up local councils so they can remove expensive and unsightly clutter from our roads.

This is a ""win-win"" reform that will save money and improve the local environment.

We're also looking at ways to devolve more responsibility for commissioning local and regional rail services - a move that could increase transparency, strengthen accountability and improve the passenger experience.

Reforms to benefit bus passengers as well:

  * Seventy million pounds of new funding to improve bus services, another thirty million pounds for green buses and an extra fifteen million pounds to support the roll out of smart ticketing
  * New regulations to ensure healthy competition
  * Support for local authorities, empowering them to deliver innovative public transport solutions
  * Measures that will encourage more people to hop on a bus - changes that will help cut carbon emissions, ease congestion and improve the quality of services.

## Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) & proposed reforms

So from game-changing reforms to major investments, we are advancing on a number of fronts.

But, as your network and this event demonstrate, it cannot stop there... because we also see a pivotal role for Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs).

We now have 39 LEPs established across England - full national coverage.

And, when it comes to transport, it is you, the LEPs, who really understand the crucial importance of good transport links to your businesses and communities.

You're the ones who know the local challenges and opportunities. The ones well placed to devise local solutions - solutions that can help boost economic growth, minimise the environmental impact of travel, improve public health and tackle social exclusion.

But, that local power and knowledge, that potential, has too often been blunted by centralised funding and bidding processes that, as you know, can be time consuming and expensive.

Our challenge, one in which we want you to play a central role, is to localise decision making. To speed it up, but to also ensure it remains rigorous, evidence based and backed up by a proper evaluation of outcomes.

And that's precisely why we have just consulted on reforms designed to devolve decisions on capital funding for local schemes to democratically accountable local transport bodies from 2015.

With these proposed reforms we are seeking to give communities real power to deliver real improvements on everything from local roads and public transport schemes, to better pedestrian routes and new rail stations.

And I think the advantages of such a system are clear:

  * Targeting funding more effectively and getting the best return on every penny spent and every pound invested
  * Making decisions that place higher weight on local priorities and needs, while generating maximum economic growth.
  * And saving a huge amount of time and effort that was previously wasted meeting central requirements.

We have made it clear that we want LEPs to be key players in the devolved process - something that's been broadly welcomed by the majority of those responding to the consultation.

But it's not for us at the centre to tell you precisely how these arrangements should work in every area. What we've done is simply open a door. It's up to you to walk through and take the steps needed to work effectively in partnership with local authorities, recognising the enhanced role for businesses and, of course, maintaining democratic accountability.

We're especially keen to see a strong role for LEPs when it comes to things like investment finance, ensuring best value, or making those tough trade-offs between competing priorities.

I'm convinced our reforms have the potential to make a positive difference.

None the less, I think it's important to recognise that achieving devolution like this is no simple task.

For example, there will obviously be a need for assurances on key areas - effective governance, financial management, accountability and the achievement of value for money.

But, then, these are matters which businesses, local authorities and LEPs deal with every day. So I am confident that, together, we can make these reforms work.

Collaboration between my Department and the new transport bodies will also be important.

Make no mistake, this is a major change and we stand ready to give help and assistance to the local bodies as they approach this transition.

That process of transition will mean a managed hand-over to transport bodies when they are ready. But let me assure you, the end game is one in which Central Government's role is light touch, rather than heavy handed.

So yes, we'll be there as good partners if and when you need us.

But I am clear that our main function is to support you. To help you adapt to, and work in, a truly decentralised decision-making system so that you can meet the challenges and maximises the opportunities.

## End to end travel

And one of the big opportunities out there is the potential to improve end to end trave - locally and nationally.

It doesn't matter if they're walking and cycling, or they're travelling by road or rail people today demand, and deserve, a transport system that provides a properly joined-up journey from front door to final destination.

Doing that might involve something as simple as providing real time travel information, or taking full advantage of smart ticketing technology.

Alternatively, it could mean giving buses priority on roads leading to railway station forecourts and placing bus stops as close as possible to the main station entrance.

But, whatever steps we take, our ambition must be seamless connections, both between different providers and across the different transport modes.

And, in my view, if anyone can help make that happen, then it's LEPs.

## Smart Localism

You'll all be aware that the consultation on our proposed reforms closed at the start of this month, and we intend to produce a report on the key findings in the summer.

Alongside this we're planning to publish indicative allocations for major transport scheme funding for local transport bodies.

As I've said, the changes we propose are important in their own right.

But I'd argue they are also part of a much bigger reform picture - one that I call ""Smart Localism"".

Smart because it recognises that a one size fits all approach cannot work in a modern world where the consumer rules and the customer is king or Queen

And smart because it enables local services, like transport, to be tailored to local needs.

Smart Localism is a challenge to the old ways of thinking and working.

It's a rejection of the Big State

No more diktats from above; no more ""Whitehall knows best""; no more treating citizens as passive recipients of standardised services.

Instead, Smart Localism is a declaration that those days are long gone and that the best government is self government.

It understands that people today want something different.

They want a genuine say over the issues that affect their lives and their neighbourhoods.

They want bespoke services that reflect their priorities and fit in with their lifestyles, whether it's their bus routes or their bin collections.

And that's what they get with Smart Localism. Because decision-making is devolved and power is dispersed to where it can do the most good - to local people.

Essentially it's about replacing the straight-jacket of central control with the freedom of civic activism.

So, for me, Smart Localism is actually about community, in the truest sense of the word.

## Conclusions

Okay, I promised at the start to keep things brief, so I think it's time I brought my speech to an end.

In conclusion, I've argued that, when it comes to transport, this Government believes local matters - to our neighbourhoods and our livelihoods... to our quality of life and our future prosperity.

But it's concrete action that counts, not simply good intentions or warm words.

So, from investments to reforms, I've walked you through some of the practical ways in which we're modernising local transport, making it fit for the demands and challenges of the 21st century.

I've also talked up the merits of what I call Smart Localism: the way that it can empower and enable: its potential to give people chances and choices because it gives them the power to control and decide - the power to ""do"".

That's why I believe in Smart Localism. But it's also why I believe in you.

Because I look on you, the Local Enterprise Partnerships, as its standard bearers - the men, the women, the Network helping to spread and embed its values.

So, before I wrap things up - and because silent gratitude isn't much use to anyone - I'd like to pay tribute to the work you do and the difference you make.

You're doing a great a job - so keep it up.

Thank you for listening and I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/speeches/greening-20120510a,Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership (LowCVP) Conference,"Speech by the Rt Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for Transport.","## Opening remarks

Thank you Neville for that introduction (Prof. Neville Jackson - Chair LowCVP)

Thank you also for asking me along, I'm delighted to be here.

## History tells a different story

There's often a tendency to talk about ultra low emission vehicles in the language of the future - ""the next generation, the cars of tomorrow"", you know the sort of thing.

But, looking back, interestingly, history tells a different story.

From the mid 19th to the early 20th century, the electric vehicle (EV) was actually the king of the road.

Compared to their petrol contemporaries EVs were much easier to drive and much cheaper to buy, run and maintain.

And, not only were they more comfortable and more reliable than petrol cars, they were far more popular.

Right up until the early 1920's cities like New York had an electric taxi fleet.

In Europe and the States, major haulage firms were using electric trucks to transport their goods.

And some countries even set up exchangeable battery services to help motorists drive longer and further.

## Three key reasons

And then things changed. So I think we have to ask, what happened? How was the electric vehicle overtaken in the race to shape and dominate motoring?

In my view there are three key reasons:

  1. A century ago we started to see major advances in the design and technology of internal combustion engines which then began to dominate the market.
  2. Mass production pushed down the price of petrol and diesel vehicles, while the plentiful supply of oil kept prices at the pumps low. The end result was that a different type of motor car entered the market with much greater affordability for customers
  3. And, last but not least, there was a radical improvement in access to supporting infrastructure. By working together, governments and private sector companies at the time ensured there were more and better roads, as well as increasing numbers of nationwide filling stations that were easy to find and quick to use. This led to an explosion in the number of petrol cars.

## Converging, coming together

What's interesting is that those three points - technology, affordability and access - are just beginning to transform the fortunes of low carbon vehicles.

Slowly but surely they're converging.

First off, we're seeing a big and rapid leap forward in the design and technology of low carbon vehicles. There was a slow start but the pace is now picking up and is making low carbon vehicles a reliable and viable choice for consumers in terms of their motoring needs today.

In fact, earlier on my way here today I saw a number of adverts for the Vauxhall Ampera, crowned 2012 European Car of the Year, and I am looking forward to taking a test drive in one later.

The second thing that's happening is a welcome shift from prototypes to mass production.

Nissan predicts it will sell 1.5 million zero emission cars by 2016.

While, according to recent research by Deloitte, eco-friendly vehicles could account for one in ten of all new global car sales within a decade. The fact that some of these cars are produced in the UK is another reason why the switch to low emission is so important for the UK.

History shows that mass production means greater affordability.

From a Government perspective, greener motoring is also being made more affordable through consumer incentives.

The [Government's Plug in Car Grant](/topics/sustainable/olev/plug-in-car-grant/) is one example - a 25% subsidy up to a maximum of £5,000.

We've launched a [Plug-in Van Grant](/topics/sustainable/olev/plug-in-van-grant/) too, which again gives 25% of the purchase price, up to a maximum of £8000, bringing these vans into an affordable range.

Arguably there's a chicken and egg situation in the development of the low emission vehicle market - we have limited infrastructure because we have few electric vehicles, and we have few electric vehicles because we have limited infrastructure.

This is a new area - we are trying to dramatically change consumer behaviours in a market used to one type of vehicle.

So it's important for us to understand how the market segments; about different types of business and leisure users, all of which will have their different success stories.

Alongside the Plug In grants, our [Plugged-In-Places Programme](/topics/sustainable/olev/recharging-electric-vehicles/) is another important piece of the picture, triggering vital investment in infrastructure.

We've also set out a comprehensive strategy around incentives and investment in infrastructure; one that identifies how recharging infrastructure will develop in a way that is targeted, convenient and safe.

And I'm pleased to say the lead we're giving in this area is paying real dividends.

Because it's encouraging private sector companies to fund and build networks of thousands of recharging points at locations around Britain, including motorway service stations.

Through a blend of supportive Government and private enterprise, we can really improve access to a new low carbon transport network where plug-in vehicles are a commonplace feature of the motoring landscape.

## Not just the cars & vans we drive

So the point I'm making is this: the factors that led to the rise and dominance of petrol powered vehicles are now starting to open the road for low carbon driving all over again.

And when you look at consumer and business take-up, it's been a predictable adoption curve. Now we are moving along that curve and a shift to low emission vehicles is underway.

It's been slow-burn, but it's been steady, and I believe it will start to pick up speed over the next 12-24 months and gain real traction.

I think it's also important to recognise the way manufactures are reducing the emissions and improving the efficiency of conventional vehicles.

For example, average new car fuel efficiency has improved 30% in the last ten years; while, on average, a new car bought today is 23% cleaner than a car designed and built in 2000.

So there is brilliant work being done here. But I still think, to meet our carbon targets, we will need to harness new types of motoring technology.

I've talked about Plug In grants and Plugged-In Places, but this Government is clear that we will be technology neutral. We want to ensure that consumers have real choice.

We should also remember that decarbonising road transport is not just about the cars and vans we drive. Nor indeed is it just about electric vehicles.

It's also about the public transport, haulage, and even the sustainability of the fuels we produce - and the DfT has been keen not to lose sight of these things.

That's why we're backing a revolution in bus travel with a multi-million pound Green Bus Fund - a scheme that has helped to deliver more than 500 low carbon buses on routes across England. And, notably, much of this work has been done by UK companies.

It's why we recently launched a low carbon truck demonstration trial - £9.5 million worth of funding to encourage, and assist, UK road-haulage operators to buy, and use, low carbon medium and heavy-goods vehicles.

It's also why, through our new Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation legislation, we only reward genuinely sustainable bio-fuels - those that deliver greenhouse gas savings but do not cause undesirable environmental impacts.

## The status quo is not an option

As I've said, I believe we are making real progress.

But I'm also convinced that for this important agenda, that the status quo is not an option. And let me explain why.

Firstly, it's a lot cheaper to plug in and re-charge than fill-up at the garage.

For example, it's been estimated that a small electric van will typically cost £100 less in fuel for every thousand miles driven compared to a diesel equivalent. And look at the Nisan Leaf - it costs £3 to go a hundred miles - dramatically cheaper than a conventional car.

So making the switch to ultra-low emission makes sound financial sense - whether you're running a business or just an ordinary motorist.

But there's a much wider economic dimension too. One that is absolutely crucial.

You see, the global market for low carbon goods and services is currently worth a staggering £3 trillion a year. And that market is forecast to grow to well over £4 trillion during the next decade.

These are very exciting times. We are witnessing the transition from oil-based mobility to other, lower carbon sources of energy. This is not just good for consumers and the environment - it's good for UK plc. We want to see our country at the forefront of R & D in this area.

So we have to seize the moment and grab a share of the green growth and those green collar jobs - which is why we're positioning this country to be a global leader in the design, production and use of electric and ultra-low emission cars.

It's already working. Nissan is building a plant to manufacture its electric vehicles and batteries in the North East. With policies that mean Britain is very definitely open for business, I believe that other investors will follow that lead. Working alongside BIS, I am determined to make that happen.

We also need to bear in mind that oil is a finite fossil fuel - one that's getting harder to find and, as we are all discovering every time we fill up our vehicles, more expensive to buy.

This is important for the public, as well as industry and jobs. And, if we want to make sure that we aren't constantly at the mercy of fluctuating world oil prices, then a brighter and cheaper motoring future is surely a low carbon motoring future.

## Concluding Remarks

  * Driving from A to B and cutting emissions.
  * Supporting public transport and helping the motorist.
  * Reducing dependency on oil and developing sustainable bio-fuels.
  * Boosting our economy and safeguarding our environment.

None of these ambitions are contradictory - they are complimentary.

They're not mutually exclusive - they're actually two sides of the same transport coin.

I started off this speech by arguing that, once upon a time, the future looked as though it belonged to low carbon vehicles.

I want to end it by arguing that history is turning full circle - that, just like the champions of the internal combustion engine a century ago, our generation has a golden opportunity to change the world and change motoring once again.

It may not be easy. And I appreciate that these early days may have felt like slow days.

But it is happening, it can be done and I'll be right behind you - so let's go for it.

Thank you

Secretary-General, President, Your Excellencies, Ministers, High Commissioners and Ambassadors, Distinguished Delegates.

It is a great pleasure to join you for this important debate.

As a major trading nation and a global maritime centre, the UK places great importance on shipping.

The Red Ensign Group is the sixth largest trading fleet in the world, and shipping accounts for over 90 percent of the UK's visible imports and exports-..

While the broader maritime industry supports more than 250,000 UK jobs; and contributes over ££13bn to our GDP.

Just as we want to see this industry prosper, we also want to see a safe and prosperous **global** maritime industry.

Free and safe trading by sea is crucial to world economic growth.

Anything that affects the transport of goods by sea and threatens the safety of seafarers should be a matter of the gravest concern to the international community.

So I am delighted that the International Maritime Organisation is holding this high level debate into the sensitive issue of privately contracted armed guards on ships, and I'd like to thank Ministers and senior representatives from Governments around the world for giving up their time to be here.

## Global problem, global response

The British Prime Minister David Cameron recently described Somali piracy as ""a complete stain on our world"".

He was absolutely right.

What began 20 years ago as a small scale problem in the coastal waters around the Horn of Africa has - over the past decade - grown into a highly sophisticated and lucrative business... threatening shipping throughout the Western Indian Ocean, and costing the international economy an estimated $7bn a year.

But while governments and the shipping industry feel the financial impact, it's the human victims of Somali piracy who are paying the biggest price.

In recent years, thousands of seafarers have been attacked, assaulted, used as human shields, or kept in extended confinement in Somalia.

It is reported that in the past four years alone, more than 60 have died.

And violence against victims is increasing.

Through their indiscriminate and brutal aggression, the pirates have made clear that any crew member on any vessel is a target.

Whatever your nationality, faith, or business; and whatever flag your ship is flying, you are seen as fair game.

So we are all in this together.

And it's clear to me that if we want to find an effective and lasting solution to the global threat of Somali piracy, we need a global response.

## Progress in recent years

Of course the international community and the shipping industry have made substantial progress in recent years.

I am sure we all welcome yesterday's successful operation conducted by the European Naval Forces' Operation Atalanta to disrupt pirates' logistical dumps in Somalia. This will increase the pressure on, and disrupt pirates' efforts to get out to sea to attack merchant shipping and dhows.

Navies from more than 20 countries are currently patrolling the seas around Somalia and the Gulf.

Many specific initiatives to tackle piracy are also being implemented.

For example, the UK has announced funding for a range of counter-piracy projects. These include supporting regional justice systems and prison capacity building in Mauritius, the Seychelles, Tanzania and Somalia so pirates can be prosecuted and punished.

Our officials are also working to help Kenya seize pirates' assets. And together with the Netherlands we are supporting a regional centre in the Seychelles for co-ordinating intelligence and pursuing the leaders and funders of piracy.

I'm pleased to say that many other states are involved in a range of similar initiatives to tackle piracy.

And, of course, the IMO is taking important steps to build capacity in the region.

The shipping industry has also developed and implemented a wide range of Best Management Practices to deter attacks and boost protection.

But I resolutely believe that we need more than a series of unilateral responses to the problem of piracy.

We need a global response. And I believe one of the most effective ways we can capitalise on our shared strengths would be to develop an internationally agreed approach to the use of armed guards on ships.

## Armed guards

Last October the [British Government announced that we would allow the use of armed guards on British flagged ships in exceptional circumstances](/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111206a).

This might apply to vessels crossing the High Risk area when Best Management Practices on their own may be considered insufficient to prevent attacks.

I know that many other Flag States are taking similar action.

This decision was not one we took lightly. Having armed guards on ships generates risks as well as benefits. But where their use is justified by a full risk assessment, and where professional standards can be achieved and assured, we believe armed guards can provide an effective deterrent.

Perhaps as a result of all of these actions, the number of successful attacks on shipping actually fell during the second half of last year.

## More to do

I welcome and applaud all the positive measures being taken to tackle this global problem.

But there is absolutely no room for complacency.

In fact we need to work together more closely... developing new strategies... using our collective expertise **and** combined focus to their very best effect.

Despite all the progress we've made, the pirates still have it too easy.

The Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden are among the busiest and most valuable shipping routes in the world. 22,000 ships pass through the Gulf each year, and the value of EU bound cargo exposed to Somali piracy, for instance, is $952 billion.

Yet the vast expanse of water in which the pirates operate obviously limits the effectiveness of naval patrols or other security vessels.

Although fewer ships may be being taken, last year the number of attacks actually rose.

Massive ransoms are still being paid out. Last year they reached a total of $160m- an average of $5m per captured ship.

And too few pirates are being brought to justice.

Action on land to improve stability remains the ultimate answer but will take time.

So until regional stability is assured, and while the profits from hijacking ships outweigh the perceived risks in the minds of the pirates, these gangsters of the sea will pose a continuing threat.

## Key priorities

So the UK believes there are two key priorities now for the international community.

**First**, we need to ensure that the protective measures are effective and safe for the seafarer.

I therefore welcome the work of the IMO on the development of guidance for shipowners and Flag States on the use of privately employed armed security guards.

I also welcome the interim guidance provided to private maritime security companies by Working Group 3 of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia.

The UK remains committed to assisting this work as we develop and implement our own national standards for private security companies, and as we keep our guidance to UK flagged ship owners up to date.

But we are clear that ultimately we need an international accreditation scheme for PMSCs - so only the highest quality organisations are employed, and so all vessels have guards on board who meet agreed security standards.

We would like the new system to be in place as soon as possible, and we believe that the entire process of international accreditation must be open, transparent and inclusive.

But it must also be practical to deliver.

So the UK would like to see an internationally co-ordinated and consistent process for embarking and disembarking private security staff and weapons in countries around the region - to ensure the safety of seafarers and vessels.

The second key priority is action to undermine the 'business model' that currently makes piracy pay.

We welcome and support the work of the Contact Group in this area which includes disrupting the illicit movements of money associated with piracy.

And we are delighted that a range of countries have agreed to join the UK led International Piracy Ransoms Taskforce, announced by David Cameron at the London Conference on Somalia in February.

This taskforce will consider ways to prevent the flow of cash to pirates. The first meeting of this taskforce will take place at the end of the month.

We know that tackling these issues will not be easy, and there may be no quick answers, but it remains critical that we work together as an international community to identify the way forward.

## Conclusion

So, to conclude, we face a very resolute and aggressive enemy, based in one of the poorest nations on earth, facing some of the greatest challenges.

And we know that combating the threat in the coming years will be extremely tough.

So we need to make the very best use of the strengths and resources we have.

And we are at our strongest when we're together....

United in our commitment to protect shipping.

United in our strategy to improve regional stability.

And united in our determination to stamp out the menace of piracy for good.

Thank you.

Thank you for that introduction Sir Edward (Sir Edward Crew - ADS). Thank you also for asking me along - I'm delighted to be here today.

This is a world famous air-show that requires world class organisation.

So, while I have this opportunity, I'd like to congratulate everyone at the ADS Group and Farnborough International Ltd for staging this incredibly impressive event.

## Protecting Britain

Farnborough is a global showcase for Britain's dynamic and successful aerospace industry. It's also a reminder of the crucial economic contribution made by the companies this Group so ably represents.

From small start-ups to multi-national corporations, and from the military sphere to the civilian sector, ADS members are creating jobs and generating growth.

But, thanks to the defence and security products they develop and manufacture, they're also helping to keep our country safe.

## Protecting Britain, our people and our interests.

That's what lies at the heart of so much of your members' work. It's also the priority that shapes and drives this Government's aviation security policy.

And that's what I want to talk about today - aviation security: the challenges we face and how best to meet them.

## Strike the right balance

In a world without terrorism the security checks employed today at our airports would never be needed. Sadly, that isn't the world we live in.

So, while going through these procedures can sometimes be frustrating and inconvenient, the undeniable truth is that aviation security exists for a reason.

And that's to deter, detect and prevent murderous attacks.

That makes airports our first line of defence.

It also makes the aviation security challenge a complex and multi-layered one.

By that, I mean that we need to strike the right balance so that we ensure the best possible passenger experience without compromising security.

And, because security is expensive, we also need to make sure that we don't place unnecessary burdens on the aviation industry.

## Global partnership, public confidence

How then do we strike that balance and meet that challenge?

Well, I'd argue that one of the most important things we need to do is collaborate with other countries in the global fight against terrorism.

Our counter-terrorist strategy is designed to reduce the risk to the UK and UK interests so that we are both protected and prepared, and people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.

And that's why we work closely with European and other international partners to develop and implement measures to improve the security environment across the world.

This can range from providing training and giving technical support, to sharing best practice and building capacity.

So, for me, a key step has to be a global partnership to confront a global problem. And, with the world coming to Britain for the Olympic & Paralympic Games, that way of working matters more than ever this year.

As you'd imagine, making sure the Games are safe and secure is a top priority. So, on land, at sea and in the air, it's at the very centre of our work right now.

But, as I've argued, when it comes to the future of aviation security the real challenge is to strike the right balance.

And a big part of that means retaining the public's confidence that what we do, and what we ask of them, is not simply effective, it's also proportionate.

Take one of the most recent enhancements of transport security, airport security scanners.

To stay one step ahead of those who would do us harm we not only have to meet the threats of today, we must also anticipate the threats of tomorrow.

New screening technologies such as scanners can help us detect a wide range of threat items, especially non-metallic items concealed close to the body.

So, beyond question, we had a duty to introduce them and scanners are now in operation at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.

But we also we have an obligation to explain and rationalise this security upgrade to the travelling public. And that's precisely what we've been doing.

Hence our decision to put a tough Code of Practice in place - one where airports are required to undertake scanning sensitively and have regard to the rights of passengers.

And crucially, the Code states that passengers must not be selected for scanning on the basis of ethnic origin, gender or destination of travel.

Following an extensive consultation process the Government has also announced plans to further improve the privacy and data safeguards for security scanners - notably requiring the use of technology that removes the need for a human to review images of passengers.

I'm sure you'll be aware that the European Parliament proposed giving passengers the right to request an opt-out from scanning.

The UK did not support these proposals when they were presented to the Aviation Security Committee. In fact, if you allow an opt-out, it defeats the point of having scanners in the first place and could well expose other passengers to unacceptable risk.

So I have used my powers as Secretary of State to block this move in the UK. If someone is selected for scanning and they refuse, then they won't be able to fly.

I believe the vast majority of travellers will see that as fair.

And, let's face it, the most basic human right of all is the right not to be blown up on a plane.

## LAGs & Backscatter

So I accept that airport checks and processes should always be as customer friendly as possible. But I'm equally determined that they should never undermine security. That has to be the bottom line.

And that same bottom line applies to the introduction of Liquid Explosive Detection Systems at our airports.

This is something that would enable people to carry greater quantities of liquids onto their flights. So it's good for passengers.

But I am clear that the systems employed must be sustainable operationally and that, again, they should not compromise security.

With that in mind, and given current technological capabilities, the implementation of EU legislation for the full introduction of liquids, aerosols and gels screening by April 2013 could be too great a challenge for airports to meet.

For that reason we're exploring options for a stepped approach to the screening of LAGs as they're commonly known - and, in particular, the screening of duty free LAGs at transfer screening points.

This would help passengers, give manufacturers a return on their research investments and encourage development of future technology to meet airport operator's requirements.

A stepped move to LAGs screening in the EU would also move us closer towards the screening of LAGs internationally, including in those states which do not impose any LAGS restrictions at all.

However, I recognise that airports have concerns about screening LAGs, fully or partially, by April 2013.

So I want to assure you that we'll be working closely with the European Commission on possible ways forward, examining in detail the full security and operational impacts of any proposals.

I also want to emphasise just how keen I am to begin discussions with my European colleagues about how we can adapt and improve existing European regulations to provide more flexibility for airports, airlines and manufacturers to develop new security solutions.

I recognise that current regulations can often be a barrier to innovation. And, even when innovation does occur, the regulatory framework can still adopt retrospective measures that stifle it.

One example of this is the use of backscatter security scanner technology at Manchester Airport, a measure that provides excellent security outcomes and improves the passenger experience.

Now, in spite of numerous scientific studies showing that this technology poses no health risk, European regulations ban its use.

So Manchester Airport is now faced with a substantial bill to replace proven, effective technology for no good reason.

## Outcome Focused Risk Based approach

There's another way we're meeting the aviation security challenge, and that's by regulatory reforms that will make a real difference.

Take the Civil Aviation Bill which, thanks to the hard work of my ministerial colleague Theresa Villiers, is making good progress through Parliament.

Through this legislation some key aviation security functions currently performed by my Department will be handed to the Civil Aviation Authority, creating for the first time a single regulator covering all aspects of aviation.

And, subject to the date of Royal Assent, we're preparing for the CAA to take on those functions from April 2014.

But perhaps the most far reaching step we've taken is our decision to reform aviation security regulations by moving to an Outcome Focused, Risk Based approach, which we propose to do through the introduction of a Security Management System.

This will be developed and operated by each responsible organisation and our intention is to begin with a series of pilots - no pun intended - starting at London City Airport once the Olympics have finished.

It's important to stress that the London City trial will be concerned only with the organisation and governance of security at the airport.

It won't focus on the security checks themselves. These will continue to be managed and delivered in the current way.

Further pilots will take place at other airports, airlines and across the wider industry.

Once these have been concluded, and we are satisfied that the Security Management System is sufficiently robust and that it will deliver its intended benefits, we'll look to roll it out across the industry. This will then provide a sound basis for the development and piloting of the Outcome Focused, Risk Based approach.

So what do our reforms actually add up to?

Well, in essence they will modernise the current security regime so that it is less prescriptive and more flexible.

In other words, we're shifting from an out-dated ""one-size fits all"" framework to a new way of regulating that is far more bespoke.

No longer will Whitehall dictate every last dot and comma of how passengers are processed.

Instead, airport operators will able to devise and implement security systems that are tailored to their particular circumstances.

So they'll be able to design made-to-measure solutions for the specific challenges they face at their airports.

But we're also making sure that this new freedom goes hand-in-hand with increased responsibility.

For example, operators will certainly be able to introduce more efficient ways of working and thereby reduce their cost base and increase their profit levels.

And, where they feel it's needed, they'll be able to focus their time and resources on cutting queuing times and speeding up throughput for travellers.

But airport operators will also be required to deliver specified security outcomes so that they achieve the same, or better, levels of security than are in place today.

In this way, our reforms strike that crucial balance between checks that are passenger friendly and checks that are also effective.

## Smarter security regulations, more business opportunities

By being less prescriptive we will free up the private sector to do what it does best - innovate.

And, not only will this help improve the passenger experience, it also has the potential to boost Britain's manufacturers

Alongside the freedom and flexibility to decide how they deliver their security outcomes, airport operators will also be able choose which security equipment they purchase and deploy.

Rather than being limited to a list of technologies drawn up by the Government, under the new system operators will have more freedom to liaise directly with manufacturers.

So they'll be able to design and order equipment that meets the required security standards, enhances the passenger experience and integrates effectively with their business processes.

And who will they go to and buy from? Well, with your track record for world class products, I'd say the people and the companies here today will be at the front of the queue.

In short, smarter security regulations mean more business opportunities. And, in that sense, our reforms in this sector are part of our wider growth agenda.

Now of course, governments can't create markets or conjure up customers.

What we can do though is put in place the conditions where private sector businesses like yours can get your foot in the door, win a contract and make a sale. And that's precisely what we're doing with this approach.

## Concluding remarks

In conclusion, today I've highlighted the importance of global co-operation in combating terrorism. And I've spoken about the key role of technologies like scanners.

I've also made the case for ""Outcome Focused, Risk Based Reform""

  * Regulations that are less prescriptive and restrictive
  * A regime that allows the flexibility to adapt and the freedom to innovate

These are the building blocks of our reforms and I'm convinced that, together, they will mean that passengers are well served, the skies are safe, our planes are secure and your industry is supported and successful.

Thank you

## Summary

Voice over: To help encourage economic growth, the Government has pledged to cut unnecessary red tape. And this is your chance to contribute to the debate on the Rail Red Tape Challenge as Transport Minister Theresa Villiers explained at a recent stakeholder summit.

Theresa Villiers: This is going even further than placing a constraint on new red tape. We're looking at the existing stock of regulations and the presumption is we're looking to scrap them unless their continued existence can be justified.

And we're introducing the Red Tape Challenge as the way to engage extensively with industry, stakeholders, professionals and, hopefully, with the wider public as well, to help us do this rigorous audit of our existing stock of regulations.

Voice over: Poorly thought out or badly implemented regulations can impose unnecessary costs on industry, passengers, and ultimately the taxpayer. The Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for Britain's rail industry, fully supports the Red Tape Challenge as its Secretary, Graham Smith, explains.

Graham Smith: The rail industry is heavily regulated, in some cases for very good reason, to maintain the industry's excellent safety record. But in other cases, with 150 years of history, seem to have gathered dust. Unless the industry, the modern industry in the 21st century, sometimes battling against out of date regulations in whether buildings, building infrastructure or building rolling stock or operating trains and stations, there just seem to be an awful lot of rules and regulations that make it very difficult to operate and efficient railway. Passengers gain, freight shippers gain from reduced cost of the industry. If we can bring down industry costs then there's a choice for government here. There's a chance to reduce the amount of money the taxpayer has to put in, reducing fares for the passenger and freight shipper or putting in investment in order to achieve the significant growth that is forecast for the rail industry over the next 20 to 30 years.

Voice over: Passenger Focus, the independent public body set up by the Government to protect the interests of passengers, believes it's vital for the passengers' voice to be heard as well. Chief Executive Anthony Smith explains.

Anthony Smith: The rail indisty is heavily regulated for quite good reason. It's largely a monopoly industry, passengers don't have a choice which train company they can use or not. There's quite a lot of rules and regulations, some of those date back years, they could probably do with a look at, but if they're sensible and giving consumers protection, it's cost effective just to keep them. Passengers must really get involved with these sorts of debate because if government asks for your opinion and you don't give it, you can't complain about the result. So its important passengers, even if it's a short comment, put something in.

Voice over: Which regulations are well designed and provide vital protection? Which are badly designed, badly implemented or simply a bad idea? Share your view by joining the debate on the Red Tape Challenge website by Thursday 15th December.",Transcript,theresa-villiers,Red Tape Challenge Stakeholder Summit,Department for Transport,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,,,09/12/2011,,

## Transcript

Narrator: The Government has announced the rail network is to be modernised, not just to tackle overcrowding, improved reliability and speed up journeys, but also to build the economy. A key part of this will be more than 2,000 new rail carriages, as Theresa Villiers, Minister for Rail, explains.

Theresa Villiers, Minister of State for Transport: This Government is committed to a major programme of rail upgrades which will benefit passengers and people who use the railways for freight right across the country. The announcement most recently is about extra carriages for a lot of our towns and cities around the country which are suffering from really serious overcrowding. We want these extra carriages to be deployed to try and address the worst overcrowding hotspots.

N: £900 million of rail electrification projects have also been announced. Lines between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool are to be electrified, as well as those between London, Didcot, Newbury and Oxford.

TV: The coalition Government supports electrification.  It was in our manifestos respectively as the two coalition partners, and it's in our programme for government.

N: The many benefits of these electrification schemes were emphasised by Norman Baker, Minister for Local and Regional Transport.

Norman Baker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport: Electrification is very important because electrification moves rail into the 21st century for those areas that haven't got electrification so far. It cuts carbon emissions; it enables trains to be run at faster speeds; improves journey times; and of course enables new rolling stock to come on stream; so passengers will notice a difference both in journey times and comfort.

N: The Government is currently taking another look at the case for continuing electrification of the Great Western line into Wales.

TV: There is further work that needs to be done on Wales, and we're going to be in discussions with the Welsh Assembly government to see what can be taken forward.  Again, it's an important issue; we need to get it right; and there's just some more work that needs to be done on this.

N: Britain is also to get a new fleet of inter-city trains replacing the ageing 30-year-old inter-city 125s on the Great Western and East Coast main lines.

NB: There's a decision to be taken about new rolling stock for the main East Coast main line and for the Great Western line out towards Wales. When we take that decision, that will influence the electrification process at that time, and the Secretary of State will make an announcement on that very shortly.

TV: This is a really important decision.  It would affect the railways for 50 years to come. We want to make sure that we get it right, therefore it's taken us some time to assess the alternatives and work out what's going to be the best way forward in terms of providing high-quality rolling stock for some of our most important lines. And actually we're here at King's Cross, just having got off the train from Leeds where I've been talking to people up there about the extra carriages programme that we are going to be rolling out before 2014, and we hope that in due course after that we'll see a replacement for the inter-city 125s on this line as well.

NB: This is a fantastic day for rail passengers and underlines the Government's commitment to rail and the Government's commitment to transport investment, both to create jobs and cut carbon.",Transcript,theresa-villiers,,Department for Transport,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,,,24/03/2011,,

## Transcript

Narrator: Rail Minister Theresa Villiers attended the launch of the Crossrail Station Design Exhibition being hosted by Crossrail and New London Architecture. The exhibition provides a glimpse of what Crossrail will look like in the future. But these new stations will be far more than iconic architecture for London's travellers, as Theresa Villiers explains.

Theresa Villiers, Minister of State for Transport: I think we've seen some great designs here at this exhibition today. I think they can really have a dramatic effect on the, sort of, quality of the travel experience in London; we're really getting a glimpse of how Crossrail can change the way we travel in London and also produce some really significant regeneration benefits for the areas immediately around the Crossrail stations, as well as, on top of, the overall benefits that the project as a whole delivers for the capital and for the UK economy.

N: Importantly, as Mayor Boris Johnson is keen to point out, these new stations will be catalysts for growth in their local area.

Boris Johnson, Mayor of London: We're going to create urban spaces where people are going to collect and meet, shop, and thereby, of course, we're going to drive economic growth - because a lot of this is about taking Crossrail and leveraging it to drive economic growth.

N: Crossrail is a project of national significance, which will benefit not only London but the country as a whole.

TV: Crossrail will bring very significant benefits to the whole of the UK economy - the benefits will be felt well beyond the capital in generating growth and jobs. That's one of the reasons why Crossrail has been given the go-ahead.

N: Analysis suggests that alongside the core transport benefits, Crossrail could generate up to £50 billion of wider economic benefits to the UK GDP and facilitate the creation of up to 30,000 jobs across London.  The Crossrail station exhibition runs until 8 September at New London Architecture, the Building Centre in Store Street, London.

## Transcript

Narrator: The Government has pledged to put rail at the heart of its transport strategy. To ensure that future rail franchises deliver improved services to passengers, better value for taxpayer money, and create the right conditions for a sustainable rail industry, the Department for Transport would like to hear from you via its rail franchising [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-28/), as Theresa Villiers, Minister for Transport, explains.

Theresa Villiers, Minister of State for Transport: As a coalition, we've made it clear that rail is a really key part of our transport strategy. That includes, of course, the high-profile projects like high-speed rail, but it also, crucially, involves doing the best we can to get our current railways working well so that we can do the best we can for passengers, and reforming franchising we think can play a really important part in that. The document discusses ways in which we can give the professionals who run our railways more flexibility to innovate, to provide the best solutions for passengers. I'm really interested to hear your views about how you'd like that to work in practice, your views about the current franchising system and what we could do to improve it, and you'll see that one of the key reforms we're proposing to make is longer franchises, and again, it would be great to get your input on how we could get the maximum benefit from that, and in particular we're looking at ways to incentivise private sector investment in our railways and our stations, because the concern is that if a franchise is only six or seven years it makes it more difficult for private sector investors to make the long-term decisions needed for railway assets that can have a lifetime of many years.

But at the same time, we need to make sure we've got robust mechanisms to protect the passenger interest. The direction in which we're going is away from detailed, specified inputs into contracts, to focusing on the outcomes for passengers, focusing on passenger satisfaction. So setting the rail industry tough targets in delivering high levels of passenger satisfaction, but giving them a bit more flexibility to innovate and decide how best to deliver on those targets, to deliver the passenger satisfaction levels that we want.

Thank you again for taking part, many thanks.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers went to Reading, one of the stations in the programme, to see progress on the improvement works. A busy junction on the Great Western Main Line, Reading station has become a notorious operational bottleneck.

Almost all trains bound for the West of England and South Wales pass through or stop at the station, which is also served by Cross Country services running to the north and south of England. Many commuters travel daily to and from London, in addition, slow moving freight traffic passes through the area as well. The improvement scheme involves building an enlarged station with new platforms and a new train depot as well as remodelling the junction so the many conflicting flows can operate smoothly without getting in the way of each other.

Once complete in 2016, the improvements will significantly improve journey times for passengers and reduce overcrowding.",Transcript,theresa-villiers,,Department for Transport,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,,,11/11/2010,,

## Transcript

Nick Cole, Head of Olympic Operations, Heathrow: The terminal has taken five months to build but its been planned for well over two years. On the 13th of August we anticipate to have our busiest day ever for departing passengers. That means we will process 137,800 passengers and also 200,000 bags. And the intent is that 10,000 of the world's athletes will use the facility you see behind me, and the reason we have done that is because we will be busy on those days and we want to ensure that passengers using Terminals One, Three, Four and Five get their normal high levels of service. Now if we do this and we get 10,000 athletes through this facility it means that everybody else in the other terminals will feel just like it's a busy summer day here at Heathrow. There are lots of other things that Heathrow is doing; the terminal you see behind me is just a part of that. We're doing remote checking down in the athlete's village the day before the closing ceremony. We've also recruited a thousand volunteers from the local community to come and work with us at games time and that's a legacy we hope to leave after the games itself. The other sorts of things we'll be doing is ensuring we've got lots of desks and other things where the Olympic family can go to, to get all their needs seen to as they come to Heathrow.

Theresa Villiers, Minister of State for Transport: I think this temporary terminal is very impressive, its not quite finished yet because the construction is finished but the operational side of it is yet to be launched but im very impressed with it because the three days after the closing ceremony are going to exceptionally busy for London's airports particularly Heathrow. The 13th August is expected to be the busiest day in the whole history of the airport, 10,000 athletes, coaches and support staff are going to be coming through this temporary terminal and having this extra departure capacity i think is going to be very important in ensuring that Heathrow can cope with that huge volume of departing passengers over those few days after the closing ceremony.

BAA: So the baton really is moving from one BAA department to another, so this is really coming from our Capital Team who have delivered the buildings to the operator.

BAA: The games terminal special though it is, is only a part of what we're doing. People will be working tirelessly in Terminals One, Three, Four and Five. On our air fields, on our roads, on our forecourts, in our baggage systems and down in the Athletes Village. They all have an equally important job to do. We here at team Heathrow are proud to play our small part in making sure that the London 2012 games are the greatest games ever. Thank you.

## Transcript

Thanks to Anne for inviting me to participate in this meeting of the North West Biofuel Network. And even though I'm not there in person I hope to offer you some ""fuel for thought"" today.

Now Biofuels is a fascinating topic to be discussing from my perspective. Not only do these fuels have a vital role in our efforts to tackle climate change but our attitudes towards them mirror our attitudes towards sustainability as a whole.

I am encouraged to see the work that has been done in the North West through initiatives such as BIONIC. Decarbonising road transport fleets is key to reducing the overall carbon emissions from transport, and it is important that we share lessons learnt in this area.

Today, I'd like to explain the role of sustainable biofuels in our wider transport strategy and how we will incentivise biofuels made from wastes.

At one time biofuels were championed as an end in themselves, the answer to petrol or diesel. But we now realise that whilst sustainable biofuels have a place within our wider strategy to create growth and cut carbon there is no single quick-fix solution.

As part of our strategy we're implementing the transport elements of the Renewable Energy Directive which requires us to source 10 per cent of energy used in transport from renewable sources by 2020.

Implementation will mean that only biofuels meeting the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria benefit from incentives under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, with double rewards for waste- derived biofuels and advanced biofuels.

Subject to the Parliamentary process these changes to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will come into force on 15 December.

Given concerns about the sustainability and deployment of biofuels we are not in a position to amend the targets set out in the current Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. But we will consult in 2012 on possible changes to the percentage of biofuel required to be supplied for the period 2014 to 2020, in 2012.

My role as Minister is to ensure that we have a settled policy framework based on good scientific evidence around sustainability, which maximises benefits of biofuel deployment across modes.

As part of this, there is a need to ensure that indirect impacts of biofuel production are taken into account.

There is compelling evidence that shows that indirect land use change is a significant issue. Ensuring that biofuel policy achieves significant carbon reductions requires that action is taken to address this issue.

I have called on the European Commission to take action in the Renewable Energy and Fuel Quality Directives to address this issue in a robust way. I expect them to come forward with a proposal shortly, if they do not do so I will seek to spur on their work and secure a robust solution to these concerns across the EU.

I am confident though that we are well prepared in the UK for changes required by the Directive for reporting against mandatory sustainability criteria.

Now we already have a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation which has been in place since 2008. But until now reporting on carbon and sustainability has only been on a voluntary basis. It meant the administrator had to work closely with ""obligated"" suppliers to ensure they are fully prepared to meet the Directive's sustainability criteria. As a result, in April, we were able to announce we were ""RED-ready"".

Through carbon and sustainability reporting under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation suppliers have shown that it is possible to provide verification of the supply of sustainable biofuels.

It is important that we consider how best to use finite resources and reward fuels which do not compete with food supply, such as those produced from wastes.

Across Government we are committed to increasing energy from waste and are working collectively to consider how best to maximise the benefits of waste energy in transport.

Our legislation implementing the Renewable Energy Directive will provide additional support to the production of advanced biofuels and those derived from waste by awarding two Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates for every litre of this biofuel that is supplied. This will provide double the support awarded to these biofuels as compared to sustainable crop-derived biofuels.

Biodiesel made from used cooking oil is clearly an important sustainable transport fuel, and we don't want to intervene where biofuels from waste oil are a commercial reality already.

The volume of used cooking oil supplied and sourced in the United Kingdom has risen significantly under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation since the scheme was introduced in 2008.

Used Cooking Oil is now the largest reported biofuel feedstock in the UK, accounting for around 30% of the total supply in 2010/11, compared to around 3% in the previous year.

My Treasury colleagues confirmed in this year's budget that the duty differential for biodiesel produced from used cooking oil will end on 31 March 2012. This incentive was introduced in Budget 2010 as a temporary measure.

I appreciate that there are concerns regarding the fluctuation of the value of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates, given that they are determined by the market. So we will continue to monitor the support provided under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation and we will also keep under review double certification to ensure that it is having a positive effect on the Used Cooking Oil industry. The Government is also minded to use the buy-out fund revenues to support the production of waste-derived or advanced biofuels and will look to introduce this mechanism to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation in due course.

I am though encouraged that recent auction data shows Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates for use in the 2011/12 obligation period selling for just over 20 pence per litre.

We launched a targeted consultation on Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation guidance in November setting out what we propose to be wastes and residues under the amended Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation.

The consultation closed on 4 December. We are examining responses and will produce final Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation guidance for suppliers and verifiers shortly.

We will of course be working with suppliers over the coming months to provide training and advice on the changes to reporting under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation.

I recognise the importance of biomethane made from waste as a sustainable renewable transport fuel, particularly in the heavy duty vehicles sector where there are few other options for reducing carbon emissions.

We have sought views from the freight sector on the use of low carbon technologies including biofuels such as biomethane and are looking at what we can do in this area as part of the Growth review following suggestions made by industry to the Secretary of State for Transport.

There are real market barriers to uptake of low emission Heavy Goods Vehicle technologies such as hybrid, electric and gas. These barriers centre around a lack of industry confidence in the technologies and an unwillingness to take on the risks of investment.

We are therefore making available £8m capital funding to pump prime procurement of low emission Heavy Goods Vehicle technologies and their supporting infrastructure. The funding includes £6.5m for a low emission vehicle demonstration trial plus the supporting infrastructure for trial vehicles, coupled with £1.5m targeted funding for public gas refuelling hubs. We will launch a competition for this funding in March 2012 and will consult with all interested parties on the scope of the competition over the course of the next three months.

Biofuels are though just one part of a wider strategy to encourage growth and cut carbon. For example, we are also committed to supporting the uptake of ultra low carbon vehicles in the United Kingdom.

£400m has been made available for consumer incentives to purchase plug-in vehicles, a program to support recharging infrastructure and targeted research, development and demonstration projects.

In June, we published a comprehensive electric vehicle recharging infrastructure strategy that sets out how we are ensuring that plug-in vehicles are an attractive choice for the motorist, how we are making it easier for individuals to charge their vehicles and making it easier for the both the private and public sector to provide recharging infrastructure by removing regulatory barriers.

With significance to the potential use of hydrogen we have also noted the Automotive Council Technology Roadmap which outlines the high level consensus among UK industry of what technology is required to decarbonise road transport in the UK.

Demonstration projects, such as The Technology Strategy Board's low carbon vehicles project and the TfL hydrogen bus demonstration, will perform a key role in supporting industrial growth and informing our understanding of these technologies.

We published a Local Transport White Paper which recognises that the best way in the short term to reduce emissions at the local level is to encourage people to make more sustainable travel choices for shorter journeys.

And the new Local Sustainable Transport Fund will enable local government, working in partnership with their communities, to provide a range of measures supporting economic recovery and reducing carbon.

We have also invested close to £50 million to bus operators - through the Green Bus Fund - to provide around 540 new, low carbon buses by April next year.

And ""greening"" our railways - by electrifying commuter lines, reducing consumption per train and proposing a high speed network as a genuine alternative to domestic air travel.

To conclude I am clear we will only be successful in our transport strategy if we effect behavioural change and provide genuinely sustainable transport. This means that we have to listen and share lessons learnt. Which is why the work of Networks such as yours is so important.

The need for such cooperation is particularly true in biofuels given these are a finite resource which we need to consider how best to deploy, on road transport and other modes. A sustainable world can only be achieved through agreement with others - Government, the transport sector, and networks such as this working as one.

My challenge is to set a policy framework which both incentivises sustainable biofuels and enables us to adapt to constraints. Such as those on the capacity of vehicle fleets and the supply infrastructure to exploit future fuels.

In summing up, we're taking the same approach to biofuels as we are to sustainability in general. By providing clarity, by ensuring choice, by encouraging co-operation we believe we can change the environment and bring people with us on this journey towards a more sustainable world.

I believe we'll get there. But to prove anything's possible let me end on this quote: ""The use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today. But such oils may become in course of time as important as petroleum and the coal tar products of the present time."" Who said it? None other than the inventor of the diesel engine himself - Rudolph Diesel.

I'm delighted to be able to be with you today, even if it is only remotely, though this virtual appearance does help me to discharge one of my portfolio responsibilities, namely encouraging alternatives to travel, of which more later.

Today's topic of green travel seems the perfect platform for discussing green technology. This represents the cutting edge for the transport industry whether you're talking about ultra-low carbon cars or low carbon buses.

The coalition Government, is fully supportive of such innovations. We're supporting ultra-low emission vehicles with our Plug-In Car Grant for both private and business buyers. We're paying around £47 million to bus operators - through the Green Bus Fund - to provide around 540 new, low carbon buses by next April.

We're also ""greening"" the railways by electrifying lines, reducing consumption per train and taking forward a high speed network - offering a genuine alternative to domestic air travel.

And, if you want to get a sense of where the technology is going, a good place to start, ironically, is London's Transport Museum - a short cycle from here. I was lucky enough to pop down there a few weeks ago. As well as glimpsing of one of those pristine new low carbon buses, I discovered the fantastic Sense and the City exhibition. For those with a passion for gadgets it offers a marvellous vision of our future capital - filled with driverless cars, unipods, emotion-sensitive scooters and the inevitable talking bus stop!

But there is another way to interpret that somewhat ambiguous phrase ""green travel"". Instead of placing the emphasis solely on technology I believe we should also be concentrating on travel behaviour. Making use, for example, of telepresence, home and flexible working, or work hubs.

This matters because, as I was reminded by my museum trip, technological change is often driven by behavioural change.

As people seek faster, safer, more comfortable journeys, so their modes of travel evolve accordingly - the horse drawn carriages of yesteryear moving aside for the electric trams and buses.

But whereas the rising public tide has forced the pace in the transport revolutions of the past, we cannot afford to wait while the earth shakes and the seas rise. The reality of climate change means we must act now. So the Government has set more radical interim limits on emissions than ever before. Our aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent from 1990 levels between 2023 to 2027. That's equivalent to 1950 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. But the task of winning hearts and minds remains.

Transport remains the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions. And commuter and business travel are still responsible for nearly 40 per cent of miles driven by car.

And despite the fact that many of you here today are at the forefront of using new technologies in business, you still tend to be the exception rather than the rule.

So it's our job to make sustainable travel as essential to business as the balance sheet or the bottom line. That means three things. First, we must show companies that this approach to travel can be successful. Case studies from Cisco customers for example, show that video and web conferencing can reduce the need for business travel by 30 per cent.

They are not alone. Microsoft has reduced travel by 27 per cent through the use of technology.

And WWF-UK's latest 'Moving On' research, shows nearly half of FTSE 500 companies have cut their flights by an average of 20 per cent in the last two years - with alternatives to travel playing a major role.

Second, we must encourage companies to realise that sustainable travel is not a complication but an opportunity. After all, we're looking to turn the UK into a dynamic, low carbon economy and companies with a green outlook will be the ones to benefit most. And with the Olympics just around the corner, the returns could come sooner than expected. Our transport system will be preparing for a huge influx of spectators during the Games.

Adopting sustainable alternatives and relieving pressure on the system will help ensure the smooth running of the Games.

Companies who adopt greener ways of doing things are already realising the benefits. For example, law firm Eversheds saved £1.3million between 2008/09 and 2009/10 just by reducing travel. Interestingly, a report produced by the Department shows that companies who think sustainably about their travel also receive a wide range of benefits such as: reduced absenteeism, increased staff retention, better productivity and improved resilience.

Third, and finally, companies looking for sustainable alternatives to travel, must plan, plan, plan. Research shows that a workplace travel plan - a package of measures to manage business travel - can reduce commuter car travel by 10 to 30 per cent. Such a plan should be comprehensive covering business location, resources, working methods, technology, resilience and capacity to adapt to a low carbon economy.

However, your solution to the carbon challenge needn't be the same as your competitor's. In addition to working hard to fill its long distance distribution vehicles, Boots is also encouraging its employees to reduce the impact of their commuter travel through car sharing, flexible working and promotion of public transport. In contrast Capgemini is reducing carbon emissions from travel by 14.5 per cent, cutting work-related flights and doubling the use of video conferencing facilities.

But Government doesn't expect you to shoulder the planning burden on your own. That's why we're supporting, financially and otherwise, the National Business Travel Network (NBTN), a business-to-business network enabling companies to share best practice and promote the business case for travel plans and Smarter Choices. You will shortly be hearing more on this from the NBTN programme director, Heather McInroy.

Government is also practising what it preaches. We've pledged to reduce our domestic business flights by 20 per cent over the lifetime of the Parliament. And my Department is looking to slash its travel by 50 per cent during the period of the Olympic Games. During a recent trial week, we positively changed almost 70% of staff trips either by entirely removing journeys or re-timing, re-routing or moving to walking and cycling.

Green travel is about more than technology. It's about sustainable ways of travelling. I know that you understand the issues and appreciate the opportunities more than most.

So I hope that your conference today gives you the platform for a stimulating debate about the changes ahead and takes us a step closer towards greener businesses and a flourishing low carbon economy.

## Transcript

Thank you for inviting me to speak today at this IMS Consulting Sustainable Business Breakfast.

I'm sorry I can't be with you in person but, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, I can at least attend in spirit. It's just a pity that we don't yet have the technology to allow me to share breakfast as well.

Now a few years ago you'd have been hard pressed to find a group of business people talking sustainability. It simply wasn't on their radar. For that matter you'd have struggled to find a Minister with sustainability as part of his or her official brief.

That shows you how far we've come. Sustainability has come out of the shadows. It is now part of the mainstream. But the trouble is it sometimes seems to be little more than a tick-box buzzword.

That is to downgrade its vital nature. For me sustainability is about the serious business of preparing for a low carbon future instead of just hoping for the best. And be in no doubt: a low carbon future is essential to our nation's future prosperity.

So what does that actually mean from a transport perspective?

Well, it may mean not travelling at all.

It is clear that alternatives to travel - such as telepresence, home and flexible working and working hubs - make sound economic and environmental sense. They can boost bottom line profits, and cut carbon. And that is not to mention the health benefits of a working day without the stress of a traffic jam or a crowded train, and the extra flexibility it brings in terms of your workforce.

Yet despite the fact that many businesses - many of you here today - are at the forefront of using new technologies in business, the use of such alternatives still tends to be the exception rather than the rule.

This needs to change. It certainly has to next year. With the Olympics just around the corner, and with our transport system preparing for a huge influx of spectators, now is surely the time to emulate the scouts and ""be prepared"".

But don't get me wrong. This isn't all your responsibility. There's a role for Government too.

We are determined to turn the UK into a dynamic, low carbon economy.

That's why, in June, we set a more radical interim limit on emissions than ever before. Our aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent from 1990 levels between 2023 to 2027.

That's the equivalent of the equivalent of 1950 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.

The Government will be publishing an action plan in the autumn setting out options to meet this ambitious target.

Of course, we're not starting from scratch.

We're already putting more that £400m over the lifetime of this Parliament to support the de-carbonization of road transport.

We're ssupporting ultra-low emission vehicles with our Plug-In Car Grant for both private and business buyers and we recognize the importance of reducing the climate impact of liquid fuels and are working to ensure that biofuels are genuinely sustainable over their life cycle by tackling their indirect impacts at the European partners on this matter.

We're also paying around £47 million to bus operators - through the Green Bus Fund - to provide around 540 new, low carbon buses by April next year. Around 185 hybrid and electric buses are already on the road delivering greenhouse gas savings of more than 30 per cent compared to diesel buses.

And the ""greening"" of the railways is also well underway. We're electrifying commuter lines, reducing consumption per train and proposing a high speed network that would offer a genuine alternative to domestic air travel.

Local transport also offers real possibilities for progress, where in many cases we may be able to make a simple switch to more sustainable modes of transport.

As two out of every three trips we make are less than five miles. Why not take the bike instead of taking the car?

This is why we have made available an unprecedented £560 million to local authorities through our new Local Sustainable Transport Fund.

The fund enables the delivery of solutions that support economic growth while also reducing carbon.

In July, I announced that 39 projects have won funding of over £150m through the first allocation from the Fund. One of these was the West of England Partnership's integrated package of measures to promote low carbon alternatives to single-occupancy car use on six routes that capture 40% of journeys to work across the West of England.

And I recently opened the pedestrian and cycle Redhayes Bridge over the M5. It's a unique way of linking economic development in Exeter with East Devon Growth Point, facilitating better access to employment sites including Exeter Science Park.

What matters about these investments is that we're not trying to force top down, one-size-fits-all solutions on local people. Different areas will inevitably come up with their own solutions.

But we can positively influence the travel choices people make.

And with Government and business working together, we can make a real difference.

Some of you might call this sustainable.

But I prefer to call it something much more old fashioned - simply good business.",Transcript,norman-baker,Bristol,Department for Transport,reducing-co2-and-other-emissions-from-transport,improving-local-transport,,,03/10/2011,,

Hello, and thank you for asking me along to your event today.

While it would be good to meet you all in person, somehow a virtual appearance feels more in the spirit of an event promoting the wonders of modern communication technology.

The convergence of next generation voice applications, cloud computing, video-technology and social media offers exciting prospects for business, not just in the future, but now.

I can't claim to be an expert in any of these new frontiers of communication - there are Expo experts out there who can tell you everything you need to know.

But I do think it's worth a step back from the bewildering array of gadgets and gizmos to remember one thing.

At root, this is all about human beings. Communications technology can only ever be as good as the communicator. And if we're to make the most of that technology, we must make sure it has a purpose, we must be clear about precisely what we want to use if for.

Otherwise it becomes a solution in search of a problem.

I think that purpose lies in radically redefining our working behaviour. Communications technology gives us the potential to sever the once unbreakable bond between work and the office. It dares us to dream of an office without walls, where work comes to you, rather than you going to the work.

Ever since the first laptops and email came onto the scene they have given us tremendous potential to work differently. Yet most businesses were happy to leave that potential untapped. They were, in the words of Marshall McLuhan, ""march[ing] backwards into the future?""

Yet that's starting to change. And for two reasons:

Firstly, necessity. The Coalition Government is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent from 1990 levels between 2023 to 2027. Since 22 per cent of the UK's domestic carbon emissions are from transport, radical reductions will require people to consider their low carbon options and virtual travel is about as low carbon as they come.

It's equally true that any business worth its salt will need to be prepared when the bad weather comes. Especially when more and more of our customers expect us to be available 24/7. Lest we forget, there are also one or two major events on the horizon - such as the Olympics - that are likely to test our transport system to the limit. Communications technology can allow companies to keep on running no matter what's coming down the track.

But the second reason why I believe businesses are starting to the tap into the true potential of communications technology is an even more powerful one. It is because they have spotted the opportunity.

Remote working is saving law firm Eversheds £1.3million a year and one Telefonica sales manager 30 working days per annum in travel.

BT found telephone conferencing eliminated 859,784 meetings per year, saved £135m and brought in an extra £103 million per year.

In the public sector too the Environment Agency reduced its business mileage by 19 million miles in the last five years through, among other things, teleconferencing. Where on earth were they going, you might ask. I confess, I don't know, but I do know they've stopped!

Elsewhere the University of Bradford found installing virtual meeting technologies in five universities reduced stress, and gave people more control of their time.

This growing recognition of the need to adopt what I see as ""unified communications"" and the growing realisation of the opportunity it represents is beginning to have a much wider impact.

We are now seeing partnerships in the public and private sector experimenting with new technology to try out new ways of doing things.

This week the Anywhere Working consortium - a business-led initiative - is running a range of activities highlighting the benefits of remote working from the value of video conferencing to the wonders of webinars.

And earlier in the month the Department for Transport was joined by 12 departments across Whitehall to try out new ways of working during a week we dubbed Operation StepChange. Use of laptops went through the roof - up on average 90 per cent. While our Secretary of State and Cabinet Minister Francis Maude also discovered a new way of holding meetings [clip of FM/JG].

These early adopters, these advocates for better ways of working, are helping us realise the true potential of communications technology. Moving us from paper-less office, to office-less work.

Turning what, up until now has been a Unified Communications theory, into Unified Communications practice.

And, in the process, fundamentally reshaping the way we work and the way we travel for the better.

Hello, and thank you for asking me along to your conference today.

While it would be good to meet you all in person, a virtual appearance allows me to demonstrate what I like to call the fifth mode of transport. As well as air, rail, sea and roads, we also have a further option - alternatives to travel.

Whether it's buses or bicycles, trains or trams, walking or the web - our transport system offers something for everyone.

But with 22 per cent of UK domestic carbon emissions from transport, the need for people to travel differently is plain. That's why I've been clear that we want to see modal shift towards leaner and greener travel - getting from A to B with smaller footprints.

Let's start at the top - or the bottom, depending on how you think about it - with the car.

Many still prefer the freedom of their own four wheels, and that's why we've pledged to take the carbon out of the car.

We're putting £400 million into electric and [low carbon vehicles](/topics/sustainable/olev), and setting up local charging networks in areas across the country through our [Plugged-In Places programme](/topics/sustainable/olev/recharging-electric-vehicles/).

And we're backing low carbon buses - which emit nearly a third less carbon than their conventional counterparts - through our [Green Bus Fund](/topics/public-transport/buses/green-bus-fund).

Let's move on.

We're ""greening"" our [railways](/rail) by electrifying lines. And reducing consumption per train.

We're supporting proposed extensions to existing light rail systems such as the Midland Metro Line One to Birmingham New Street Station.

And we're investing in [high speed rail](/topics/high-speed-rail) which will see clear benefits to the people of Birmingham - direct links to the continent, a huge uplift in capacity and a genuine alternative to domestic air travel.

This is the kind of investment that will help us break out of the one track approach to transport, giving more people more genuine travel choices.

Moving on again, improvements in infrastructure aren't all big ticket items down to central government.

The £560m available in our [Local Sustainable Transport Fund](/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110119) is giving local authorities the means to create transport solutions to fix problems in their local areas.

One beneficiary is Bike North Birmingham. It's providing cycling infrastructure in Sutton Coldfield where the poor integration of transport networks, coupled with an over reliance on private cars for short trips, has resulted in high carbon emissions.

But though these improvements have undoubtedly been - and will continue to be - important, the real game changer has been something else - communications technology.

The email, the laptop, the internet superhighway - each of these inventions has redefined our world and together they stand poised to revolutionise our travel behaviour.

It's like counting up so far, only to re-discover the power of zero.

You don't need to jump in your car anymore to make those vital connections between people and places, companies and clients - you can do it virtually via video conference or webinar.

What's more, climate change has given us an iron-cast reason for using this type of technology. This Government has set itself the most challenging target on climate change yet - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent from 1990 levels between 2023 to 2027. That's equivalent to nearly 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.

But having different travel options and getting people to make different travel choices are two entirely separate things.

Travelwise know this better than most. You and this agenda go back a long way. In fact, many of your members were working on this in the mid-nineties as part of predecessor organisations.

I don't doubt the significant impact you've already had - although I don't think it would be overstepping the mark to say it's been an uphill struggle!

Even today we find that most people still prefer one method of getting into work above all others.

And that includes the iPod generation, who are undoubtedly aware of the travel alternatives out there and recognise more than most the need to change their travel.

It is just as JK Galbraith once said: ""Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everybody gets busy on the proof.""

Psychologists have a name for this type of behaviour - they call it cognitive dissonance.

I call it a missed opportunity.

After all, the evidence shows that those organisations who encourage a different approach to travel reap the rewards.

On one level this is about resilience. In an age of 24/7 communications people expect a 24 hour service come rain or shine. The company that is prepared will be the one that succeeds.

But it's more than that.

Cisco found that the use of telepresence technology alone saved the company $759 million in direct travel costs over four years, and the use of business video removed the need for travel in a third of meetings.

And over the last five years, the [Environment Agency](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/) has reduced total business mileage by 19.3 million miles and saved around 5,000 tonnes of CO2. The Agency currently hold around 6000 tele and web conferences a month and it is estimated that each of these saves £389 in travel & subsistence costs, 605 miles and 175Kg of CO2.

Centro - the Integrated Transport Authority here in the West Midlands - has embedded flexible working across the organisation. Its flexible hours working scheme means employees can organise their work around quieter travel times. Centro also encourages the use of mobile technologies - providing Blackberry smartphones, supporting home working, using conference calling, and they've just introduced videoconferencing facilities.

All this has resulted in increased business effectiveness - and has also had a positive effect on employee health and well being. The average number of days sick leave has halved to an average of just six days per employee - below the average for the private sector.

Meanwhile, by operating a flexible hours system, Centro has found its traffic and emissions are spread out over the course of the day instead of intensely concentrated for short periods of time.

Nor should we be surprised at the University of Bradford's findings that virtual meeting technologies improved well-being: reducing stress, ensuring people were more in control of their time, and enhancing communication with colleagues.

By testing the waters, these pioneering companies have made a practical case for travel alternatives. But that alone is not enough. We need partnerships of the willing, public and private, ready to come forward and advocate for this agenda.

I'm glad to report this is starting to happen.

For example, through the [Anywhere Working initiative](http://www.anywhereworking.org/), businesses united around the benefits of communications technology and remote working to promote smarter ways of working to businesses and individuals.

In Whitehall, we're using the [Olympics](http://www.culture.gov.uk/london2012/index.aspx) as a way to encourage more flexible travelling and working.

During our [trial travel week](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2r1f4Zqt7U&list=PLCD14C61E227C57D6&index=1&feature=plpp_video) in February the Department for Transport was joined by 12 Government departments all trying to positively change their commuting travel by 50 per cent.

It could be by reducing or retiming journeys, by taking different modes of transport, or by rerouting to avoid areas that will become transport 'hotspots' during the Olympics. In the event the Department for Transport managed to positively change 71% of commuter journeys.

But despite this progress there's plenty of work to do. Our investment in infrastructure both centrally and locally will continue.

And if we want to encourage people to make different choices, we have to think more about their end-to-end journeys.

This isn't just about getting on the train but purchasing a ticket too. Smart ticketing offers the potential for new flexible tickets that suit the flexibility of modern working patterns and can encourage more efficient use of the transport network.

Significantly, we're on track to provide the infrastructure that will enable most public transport journeys to be undertaken using smart ticketing by 2014.

But Government has only ever been part of this story. With our local partners we can make sure local people have travel options. But they have to take the next step for themselves.

So what should they do?

I think it's time to dust down your green cross code and remember those life changing words: stop, look and listen.

Before deciding to travel, we want people to stop and think about whether it's absolutely necessary to travel.

We want people to look. Use our [Transport Direct carbon calculator](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/JourneyEmissionsCompare.aspx?&repeatingloop=Y) and the numerous travel apps on the market, to explore the travel options out there.

And we want people to listen. There's not just good advice out there but real practical examples of how this work can make a difference - you'll find plenty on the Anywhere Working website and I'm sure you'll hear about more today.

Like the Green Cross Code, once you start making smarter travel choices it should become second nature, a normal way of doing business.

Changing the way you and your organisation travel will not simply benefit you but our environment and economy as a whole.

So, when it comes to alternatives to travel, we're simply saying give it a go.",Transcript,norman-baker,West Midlands,Department for Transport,reducing-co2-and-other-emissions-from-transport,improving-local-transport,,,24/04/2012,,

Hello, I'm sorry that I can't be with you at your conference today, but thanks to video technology, I'm delighted to be able to make a contribution to this important event and of course, it helps me to promote an important part of my ministerial brief - namely alternatives to travel.

This is of course, why you're here today, to deal with the vitally important issue of sustainable transport and alternatives to travel in the context of corporate responsibility and collaboration. These are issues that concern every business and employer in building a strong and competitive UK economy.

This Coalition Government's core agenda is restoring fiscal responsibility; securing sustainable economic growth and achieving carbon reduction goals. And it is this Government's belief that transport is integral to both supporting economic recovery, advancing social mobility and tackling climate change.

We want to encourage people to make more journeys by sustainable, carbon-friendly modes of transport - from walking to cycling, from car-sharing to public transport - and, indeed, to think about whether they need to travel at all. But to deliver this sustainability in the longer term will be a challenge. To make it a reality, you need an effective framework of policies and programmes. And that's exactly what this Government has got.

One of our first actions on coming into office was to cancel the third runway at Heathrow and focus instead on maintaining Heathrow's vital role as a global hub airport within the footprint it already occupies.

As you will have heard in the Public Spending review, we've also committed to developing and building a High-Speed Rail network to link the major English conurbations with onward links to Scotland and Wales.

Similarly, the review confirmed our intention to deliver Crossrail in its entirety - a rail infrastructure project this Government regards as a significant growth generator, with real economic benefits that will be felt far beyond London.

As part of the recent Spending Review, the Government has also announced provision of over £400 million for measures to promote the uptake and development of ultra-low carbon vehicle technologies.

This includes support for consumer incentives for electric and other ultra low emission cars throughout the life of this Parliament. From January 2011, the Plug in Car Grant will provide consumers with up to £5,000 towards the cost of a qualifying car.  We will be reviewing the level of the incentive regularly to ensure that the UK remains competitive and taxpayers get value for money. The first review will be in January 2012.

And we are continuing to invest in electric vehicle recharging infrastructure as well as in vehicle research and development. This new generation of vehicles can help drivers and businesses to cut running costs as well as shrink their carbon footprint.

The Department is also making efforts to work with industry stakeholders to de-carbonise road freight.

However, most journeys aren't made on our national networks, but on our local roads and it is at local level that the most can be done to change patterns of behaviour and to create more genuinely sustainable transport modes while at the same time stimulating urban regeneration, economic growth and social integration.

Examples include:

Cycling initiatives that transform peoples' way of travelling around urban centres.

Attractive, air-conditioned buses running on prioritised routes that have the kind of appeal to passengers that metro systems have traditionally enjoyed.

Smart cards are making multi-modal journeys easy and seamless.

The Department also supports the important role that sustainable travel initiatives such as car clubs and car sharing play.

And we recognise that light rail can also play an important part in providing the vital transport links from outlying areas to city-centres.

We also announced our support, following the Spending Review, for important infrastructure projects such as the proposed Midland Metro extension to New Street Station. This will improve the competitiveness of the economy of Birmingham by providing greater connectivity, increasing the network's capacity, and reducing congestion.

In order to support local measures, we're moving away from the top-down command and control system in favour of localism.

Underpining our localism agenda is the ""Local Sustainable Transport Fund"" of £560 million over four years. It will be for local authorities working in partnership with their communities, as well as with neighbouring authorities, transport providers and transport users, health service organisations, environmental groups and local people - to decide on the right solutions for their area.

These solutions will address congestion, urban regeneration, social integration, road safety, air quality and local environmental and carbon reduction targets as part of a single integrated agenda. And I will be announcing further details on the guidance and funding criteria soon.

I am the first ever Transport Minister to have official responsibilities for alternatives to travel, which is an agenda that seeks to tap into the greenest travel option of all - namely not travelling. Of course my mission isn't to stop people travelling, but to ask everyone to give greater consideration to whether their journeys are necessary in the first place.

Measures such as encouraging home working; staggering people's working days so roads and trains are less congested at peak times; promoting the use of high-speed broadband for both business and leisure purposes and encouraging the uptake of video conferencing as an alternative to long-distance travel -all play a part in achieving travel reductions and subsequently contribute towards greater business efficiency and reducing business costs.

I'm currently working with other government departments and Businesses to make a real difference in the amount of travelling undertaken and look forward to seeing greater progress being made in this area.

Business in the Community's Corporate Responsbility Index, which this year for the first time included a section on commuting and business travel, identifies that 80% of these corporately responsible businesses now have key performance indicators covering emissions from business travel with 20% including commuting.

Research tells us that the businesses already at the forefront of managing and measuring corporate responsibility consistently out perform their competitors who don't.

I've had the opportunity to preview the new 'ways2work' initiative which is a great resource for businesses. If businesses have been struggling to understand why work-related travel is relevant to their business, then 'ways2work' will show them the positive financial, social and environmental benefits that result from travelling more sustainably and indeed not travelling.

We have to embrace the challenges we face and now is the time for you to take your place as part of the solution by promoting and enabling sustainable travel measures and alternatives to travel. Put them at the heart of your business travel plans and see how they can have positive knock on effects to your budgets, the effectiveness of your businesses, the environment and on society as a whole.

You're responsible for keeping your businesses mobile and by working together I believe you can positively influence the travel choices people make for their commuting and business needs and so reduce the impacts of transport.

My thanks to the National Business Travel Network for putting together this excellent event and thank you for listening to me and I wish you a great conference.

Hello, thank you for inviting me to speak today. I'm sorry I'm not here in person for the second year running, but I had already accepted an invitation to address a cycling conference today. However, my now well-used video technology has allowed me to be in two places at once, which is fortunate because I wanted to thank you for your work towards achieving more sustainable, clean and energy efficient urban transport systems. This work is important and a great deal has happened since your First Annual Sustainable Mobility Conference in October last year.

As those of you who attended that event will know, I'm a strong supporter of local authorities working together to address our shared transport challenges in a way that helps local economies and reduces carbon emissions. CIVINET is an enduring example of such positive co-operation.

In January this year I was delighted to launch our new Local Transport White Paper. This sets out how the Government will deliver on its commitment to support sustainable travel. I'm sure some of you will have noticed the complimentary mention in the White Paper of CIVINET's efforts as an example for other local authorities to follow.

Around half of all car journey's are between 1 and 5 miles, and 2 out of 3 of all the trips we make are under 5 miles - as such, these represent the biggest opportunity for sustainable travel options such as walking, cycling or public transport. The Government believes it is local authorities who know their communities best. As such, they are far better equipped to make the changes needed to encourage sustainable travel locally. And this is why the White Paper puts localism firmly at the heart of the agenda to create growth and cut carbon by focussing on encouraging and enabling people to make sustainable travel choices.

Measures such as travel planning, car sharing, car clubs, and encouraging the use of public transport, along with walking and cycling have been proven, through initiatives such as the Sustainable Travel Towns and CIVITAS projects, to be highly effective. They are often cheap, and demonstrate high value for money.

As you may know, an unprecedented £560 million has been allocated to local authorities through our new Local Sustainable Transport Fund to support such local measures.

Despite the difficult economic background, this is a significant increase in funding for this area and reflects the commitment of the Government to this area as well as the good value for money such investment requires.

The purpose of the Fund, which was announced alongside the White Paper, is to enable the delivery of solutions that support economic growth while reducing carbon. These solutions will be geared to supporting jobs and business by effectively tackling the problems of congestion, the reliability and predictability of journey times, as well as enabling economic investment, the revitalisation of town centres and enhanced access to employment.

At the same time, they should enable changing patterns of travel behaviour and greater use of more sustainable transport modes and so deliver a reduction in carbon and other harmful emissions.

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund forms part of a wider picture of more streamlined and simplified funding to local authorities. Transport funding streams have been radically simplified - down from 26 to just four. The Fund also represents a move away from specific grants, so providing Local Authorities with the freedom to develop their own targeted transport packages that address the particular transport problems in their area. And in addressing those problems, it's been important for local authorities to work with the local community, for example local businesses as well as with the voluntary, community the social enterprise sector.

In April, we received 73 tranche 1 and key component bids from 66 authorities, and I will be announcing the successful bids later this month. The Department has also received a further 41 expressions of interest for tranche 2. We're currently assessing 19 initial proposals for large projects, and I intend to announce the shortlisted authorities in July. In all, having received applications from 96 transport authorities, I've been delighted with such a positive response.

As the first ever Transport Minister to have official responsibilities for alternatives to travel, I often point out that the most sustainable mode of transport is not travelling at all. My mission of course, isn't to stop people travelling, but I'd certainly like everyone to give greater consideration to whether their journeys are really necessary in the first place.

There are several measures that can contribute towards greater business efficiency for example. Encouraging home working; the use of high-speed broadband and the uptake of video conferencing - all can provide viable alternatives to long-distance travel and not only reduce carbon, but business costs too. And I know many employees would welcome the introduction of staggered working days as means to avoid peak travelling times, instead going to work when roads, buses and trains are less congested - while employers may welcome the greater pool of employees for which they can draw, as well as the reduction in overheads.

Encouraging sustainable transport in order to create growth and cut carbon is fundamental to my Department's ambitions for our future transport system. And let's not forget there are further benefits. Currently, the costs to society of physical inactivity, poor air quality and noise are up to £25 billion per year. In contrast, investment in sustainable transport helps make our towns and cities healthier and more attractive places to live, work and shop.

To sum up, I am very encouraged by the quality of the bids we've received so far through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, and look forward to seeing how our objectives will be achieved through the implementation of successful proposals.

My apologies again for not being able to be with you in person, but I'm sure your day will be productive and engaging one. And thank you for watching.",Transcript,norman-baker,,Department for Transport,reducing-co2-and-other-emissions-from-transport,improving-local-transport,,,23/06/2011,,

## Video transcript

Narrator

Blue Badges provide a vital lifeline to over 2.5 million disabled people every year and the Government plans to crack down on drivers who abuse the disabled parking system, as Minister for Transport Norman Baker explains.

Norman Baker

The Blue badge system hasn't changed for 40 years. It's a cardboard system, it's hopelessly out of date, very easy to defraud and that's why in some areas of the country we're seeing up to 40% fraudulent use, 20% in many areas and that's not acceptable for those relying on Blue Badges because they need them. And why should they be disadvantaged by people perfectly able bodied parking in their spaces, taking away their spaces and also defrauding the council of legitimate money?

Helen Dolphin

The Blue badge scheme is really important to me and numerous other disabled people with mobility problems because it allows us to park close to our destinations. So, for example, for someone not disabled can, well, they can walk, catch a bus, they've got many more options. But if you're disabled, all those options aren't really there, you really do rely on your own vehicle and the hardest thing can be parking and that's why Blue badge is so important.

I've been a Blue badge holder for about 15 years and I've seen over that time it become harder and harder to park.

And over the years I've just seen it's much much harder if I want to go to my city centre. I have to get up really early if there's any hope of getting a space on the street and not being able to park in the car park because I can't use any of the barrier technology that's in use, I really rely on parking on the street with my Blue badge and again it's really restrictive not being able to use that badge with ease. And I think one of the reasons is because the badge is being used by people's friends and families, there's all sorts of knock off copies people are using.

Narrator

New measures include the replacement of handwritten badges with standard electronic ones which are harder to alter and forge.

Norman Baker

We've taken a number of different steps to make the badge much more secure. There's a large number of new safety devices and aspects to the new badge, which make it very difficult to forge. I believe it's as secure, if not more secure than a banknote. So people who've been busy defrauding councils in the past can forget about it. The new Blue badge is going to be very secure so they may as well go elsewhere.

Narrator

One man who makes it his business to catch Blue Badge abusers is Keith Parcel, a Fraud Investigation Officer with Wandsworth Council. He believes the new badge will have an immediate impact on fraudulent use.

Keith Parcel
Fraud Investigation Officer

We're finding that about 15 to 30% of cases we deal with involve either scanned copies of genuine badges, forged badges or fake badges that have had their expiry dates altered to make it look like they're still valid. Having seen the new design of the badge, it's going to be extremely difficult to perpetrate that kind of fraud without it being blatantly obvious on the badge.

It's a criminal offence, obviously there's fraud involved, defrauding the parking systems, there's financial gain to be made, so in Wandsworth there's a zero tolerance policy. If anyone is caught systematically abusing Blue Badge to gain free car parking, we'll look to gather sufficient evidence that we can take to court and prosecute them and also tow their vehicle away once we've conducted the investigation.

It tends to average in our cases prosecutions, most defendants having to pay between £1000 and £1500 and also having to pay for getting their car back out of the car pound. Obviously if there's issues like it's a stolen badge it's an altered badge or forged badge, then more serious criminal charges can be brought in using the Theft and Fraud Acts and these potentially carry prison sentences. What we tend to see is quite a few defendants end up having to do community service.

Narrator

More checks will be made at application stage to ensure only those in genuine need can get a badge and a new national database will also cut down fraudulent use.

Norman Baker

I think there's very good news for disabled people. It means that those who are entitled to have a badge can get one in the knowledge it'll be personal to them, it is not going to be subject to fraud and misuse, and they've got a better chance of getting a parking space than hitherto they have had.

Helen Dolphin

[So] I think it's really great we are at last tackling the problem and the fraud.

## Transcript

Hello. I'm very sorry I can't be with you at your conference today, but I wanted to contribute to the debate - so I am grateful to HAUC for giving me this chance to address you with the aid of video technology and at the same time fulfil part of my ministerial brief, namely that of alternatives to travel.

It is really good that the different parts of the UK are coming together to share and compare experiences about street works.

As you are only too aware, streetworks can be an extremely contentious and divisive issue. Although essential to the fundamental services on which we all depend, most of us have experienced the problems poorly managed works can cause, particularly in congested towns and cities.

The task we face is to balance the need for infrastructure repairs in an efficient manner, while at the same time minimising disruption to businesses and individual road users along with the impact on a local community as a whole.

It is now more than one year since the General Election - and since the Coalition Government came together to tackle Britain's debt crisis, we have made it clear that we need to cut waste, drive through greater efficiencies, improve returns on investment, and deliver more with less.

To that end, we made a commitment to reduce red tape and remove unnecessary burdens from business. And we set out our belief that regulation must be seen as a last resort, not an instrument of choice.

Each one of these priorities applies just as much to local councils and communities as it does to Central Government. Indeed, we believe that local communities and the councils they elect, not Whitehall bureaucrats, are best placed to devise local solutions. If decision-making is devolved and power dispersed, local problems, such as road congestion, can be more easily defined and solved. And the government's role is to make sure that local communities have the right tools to do the job.

Now this is as true in the area of street works as it is in any other.

We are already taking action to ensure local authorities are able to tackle over-running street works more effectively. For example, we're working to increase financial incentives for utilities to complete works on time.

We'll also have legislation by December that enables local authorities to propose lane rental pilot schemes. We want to see a very small number of pathfinder schemes to assess their cost effectiveness and see if lane rental can usefully play a wider role.

Later today you'll be discussing permit schemes and, as I set out in my recent letter to Council Leaders, I want to reiterate my support for the schemes in Kent, London and Northamptonshire.

Initial indications suggest these programmes are delivering real benefits, not only reducing the number of days' occupancy, but crucially, also reducing the number of complaints from the public about street works. They are a tangible example of what can be done when utilities and authorities work together to tackle disruption.

I can confirm - after a year of Coalition Government - that co-operation and partnership working does throw up the odd challenge. But sometimes it is the only way to deliver a solution that benefits all.

To make it easier for permit schemes to be launched, we're reducing the bureaucracy for local authorities. Firstly, I am proposing that we stop Whitehall interference by removing the Ministerial role from the permit approval process by April 2012 and we'll be consulting on this proposal shortly.

And where it makes sense, we want more creative thinking to find alternatives to regulation and so reduce the burden on local communities and authorities.

As you may know, the Government is taking forward a scheme called ""the Red Tape Challenge"". This gives the public an opportunity to tell us which regulations are not working or necessary. Roads regulations, including street works, are currently up for debate - you can find out more about this by going to the DfT website and YouTube channel - and I'm pleased to see that the streetworks sector is already contributing to the process.

In general I welcome the range of non-regulatory solutions the sector is taking forward and would encourage everyone to make the most of them. Working together on good practice, taking forward the NUAG project to improve information sharing and rolling out the HAUC UK national code of conduct are all excellent initiatives - and I wish them every success. The more the sector can show its ability and desire to work together to deliver better outcomes for the public, the less need for government to step in and regulate.

An initiative that I'm particularly keen to see succeed is work to monitor performance across the sector. With utilities and highway authorities benchmarking their performance against others in the sector, the issue of underperformance can more effectively be addressed. Performance data published by the Scottish Road Works Commissioner, John Gooday, has played a useful role in Scotland and we hope the work of HAUC in England will prove similarly helpful.

Along with the tools we're giving to local authorities, I'd also like to encourage a more common-sense approach. Rules should be applied with caution so as not to stifle innovation or create perverse outcomes.

An example that comes to mind relates to safety at street works sites. We all want to have safe, accessible roads and working environments, but traffic flow also needs to be managed competently and a balance struck on issues such as minimum footway widths. Instead of a blanket approach I would expect local authorities to come to a sensible decision about individual sites, taking into account their local knowledge and expertise.

I'm also very keen to see the sector make the most of new technology and innovation. To support this, last month, along with Transport for London, we announced research and development funding for new technology to reduce the disruption caused by street works. The 18-month project being undertaken by the Transport Research Laboratory will examine innovative engineering techniques that might allow works to be carried out at quieter times and roads to be reopened during peak traffic periods to reduce delays and disruption.

Better engagement with the public is also high on my agenda and I'm pleased that HAUC has decided to share good practice in the area of communications. All too often we have a situation where authorities and utilities know what is going on, but ordinary members of the public do not. A classic example is where street works sites are left empty. There can be good reasons for this, such as allowing time for concrete to cure, but all the general public sees is a street works site blocking their road and nobody working on it.

Failing to give people simple details about a works scheme is not only discourteous - it's actually unprofessional, and can generate a lot of time-consuming complaints. In contrast, good information buys a lot of goodwill, and I hope that all parties will take up the challenge of doing more in this area going forwards.

Apologies once again for being unable to attend today, but thank you for watching, and I wish you a very productive conference.

## Transcript

Good morning and thank you for taking the time to attend today's workshop on the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. I'm sorry I'm not here in person, but as the first Transport Minister to have specific responsibility for alternatives to travel, it's perhaps appropriate for me to take advantage of video technology to make a virtual appearance at each of these events.

Last month I was delighted to announce our new [Local Transport White Paper, Creating Growth Cutting Carbon](/publications/making-sustainable-local-transport-happen/). An unprecedented £560m has been allocated to local authorities through our new Local Sustainable Transport Fund to support this.

The White Paper forms part of our overall strategy to tackle carbon emissions from transport.

The Government is convinced that in the longer term, progressive electrification of the passenger car fleet will play an important role in decarbonising transport. We also need to reduce the carbon impact of longer journeys - and high speed rail between some of our largest cities has a critical role to play. By prioritising spending on key rail projects such as [high speed rail](/topics/high-speed-rail/) and [Crossrail](/topics/crossrail/), we will be providing commuters and intercity travellers with attractive new options instead of the car.

But the White Paper sets out the tools that are available to us now to provide that early reduction in carbon emissions that local action is best placed to deliver. Those tools are sustainable travel measures. [Sustainable travel](/topics/sustainable/) is important because it not only reduces carbon, but also tackles congestion and brings additional health and environmental benefits.

And these measures - as demonstrated by the Sustainable Travel Towns, and the Cycling Demonstration Towns - have proven, economic evaluations which show that they are high value for money.

This is why the White Paper focuses on encouraging and enabling people to make sustainable travel choices for local trips. These represent the biggest opportunity for sustainable travel options such as walking, cycling or public transport, because around 2 out of 3 of every trips we make are less than 5 miles.

Research also shows that improvements to sustainable travel can increase turnover in the high street by five to 15 per cent. because people who travel to the shops on foot, by bicycle or public transport perhaps surprisingly tend to spend more per head than those who travel by car. It also helps tackle congestion, which cause delays in urban areas at a cost of around £11 billion per annum.

And let's not forget there are further benefits - investment in sustainable transport helps make our towns and cities healthier and more attractive places to live, work and shop. Currently, for example, the costs to society of physical inactivity, poor air quality are up to £25 billion per year.

Of course, the most sustainable mode of transport is not travelling at all. Although I'm the first ever Transport Minister to have official responsibilities for alternatives to travel, my mission isn't to stop people travelling. But I'd certainly like everyone to give greater consideration to whether their journeys are necessary in the first place.

Measures such as encouraging home working:

  * staggering people's working days so roads and trains are less congested at peak times;
  * promoting the use of high-speed broadband for both business and leisure purposes
  * and encouraging the uptake of video conferencing as an alternative to long-distance travel
  * all play a part in achieving travel reductions and subsequently contribute towards greater business efficiency and reducing business costs. I would encourage you to think about how such measures can be incorporated into your bids.

The White paper is deliberately not prescriptive, but provides practical guidance with examples of ways in which local authorities can and are dealing with the transport issues in their areas.

This reflects our commitment to end the top down decision making and the tendency in Whitehall to develop 'one size fits all solutions', which ignore the specific needs and behaviour patterns of local communities.

The Government has already taken significant steps to hand back power to local communities. These include decentralising economic power through the Regional Growth Fund, the new Local Enterprise Partnerships; decentralising land use planning through the new Planning Policy Frameworks; and increasing transparency and accountability.

And the Local Sustainable Transport Fund forms part of a wider picture of more streamlined and simplified funding to local authorities. Transport funding streams have been radically simplified - down from 26 to just four. The Fund also represents a move away from specific grants, so providing you with the freedom to develop your own targeted transport packages that address the particular transport problems in your area.

We're particularly keen to receive bids for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund from local authorities who are in partnership with the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector, as well as having the support of local businesses. I believe that by encouraging bids in this way, we will be able to capture innovative solutions to local transport needs in both rural and urban areas.

An example I often quote is the Cuckmere Community Bus in my own constituency. Individual residents in the Cuckmere Valley have come together to run regular and frequent bus services, taking people in rural areas to their nearest towns. These services are provided entirely by volunteers.

'Wheels to Work' schemes provide transport to people who are unable to access training, employment or education, due to a lack of suitable public or private transport. They particularly benefit people living in isolated rural communities and can play an important part in helping others to come off benefits and regain their independence.

These are real examples, happening right now, and in today's poster presentations you will be hearing about other successful sustainable travel initiatives that have been delivered. We want to enable similar stories to unfold in many more places across the country. The design and scope of the packages you submit are entirely up to you, so long as you can demonstrate a clear fit with the Government's new vision for sustainable travel. And I have been keen to offer a flexible bidding process - reflecting not only the complexity and scale of bids, but also the state of readiness of proposals. The Department's assessment of bids will also be proportionate to the value of bids that are submitted.

This new vision for local transport - creating growth and cutting carbon through small scale sustainable transport packages, is being rolled out against a backdrop of nation-wide initiatives with the same objectives. The investment we've committed to sustainable transport further underlines our determination to secure growth while cutting carbon.

For example, over £400 million has been earmarked to promote the uptake of ultra low carbon vehicle technologies.

Progressive electrification of rail routes is also on the agenda.

And the Green Bus Fund will help fund around 500 new hybrid and electric buses, playing a vital role in unlocking potential and stimulating a growing market.

With operators and public sector bodies, we're also delivering the infrastructure to enable most local public transport journeys to be undertaken using smart ticketing by December 2014.

Finally, we're reviewing the way in which transport investment decisions are made to ensure that the carbon implications are fully recognised.

To sum up, the Government wishes to support as many authorities and their partners as possible through the Fund. The Local Transport White Paper sets out the vision and through the Fund we've provided you with the resources to take it forward. The rest is up to you. I hope you find today's workshop helpful in putting your bids together and I very much look forward to receiving the first round of applications in April.

Thank you.

Narrator: Transport Minister Norman Baker announced the winners of the Green Bus Fund in Newcastle. The £15 million fund is designed to encourage bus operators and local authorities to buy new hybrid and electric buses.

Norman Baker, Minister for Local and Regional Transport: I'm here in the north east to announce the winners of the second tranche of the Green Bus Fund: £50 million of Government money to pump-prime the investment in green buses which is being handed out to bus companies across the country in recognition of the determination of the Government to reduce the carbon content of road transport and to encourage the take-up of green buses. Stagecoach North East are benefiting here in Newcastle; others are benefiting across the country and there's a real commitment from the Government to investment in low-carbon public transport.

Narrator: Thanks to the funding, around 170 hybrid and electric vehicles will come on-stream by March 2012. Among the successful bidders for the funding was Stagecoach, which plans to purchase and run 47 new buses for its north east and Yorkshire services.

Robert Andrew, Regional Director North, Stagecoach UK: It's excellent news. You know, we were successful in the first round of Green Bus Fund bidding as well. We've got new vehicles already in service in Oxford and Manchester, and to learn today that we're able to introduce further new vehicles here in Newcastle and also into Sheffield is absolutely excellent news. Though we've spent a lot of time and effort and money looking at alternatives to conventional diesel power, hybrid is one of those: we're running on fully sustainable bio-diesel on some of our operations. So we're always looking for ways to make the business more environmentally friendly.

NB: This scheme alone will save 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. But that: you know, this is in a sense not designed to be the end of it, this is a start. This is designed to help encourage the market for green buses, to bring down the average price of the bus and to make these buses the norm rather than the exception. It's a way of saying to people we are serious as a Government about cutting carbon; we're serious about modern public transport. We're leading the way and we encourage local authorities and bus companies to follow.",Transcript,norman-baker,Newcastle,Department for Transport,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,reducing-co2-and-other-emissions-from-transport,,10/11/2010,,

## Transcript

Norman Baker: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for attending today's workshop for Tranche 2 bids to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. Because of other diary commitments I'm afraid I can't be with you in person today, but as minister for alternatives to travel, I can at least make a virtual appearance so that I can update you on the Fund's progress.

In July, I was delighted to award £155m of funding to support the delivery of 39 excellent sustainable transport projects. Underpinning all of these successful projects are measures that address our core objectives for the Fund - namely helping to build stronger local economies and addressing the urgent challenge of climate change: creating growth, cutting carbon. The successful schemes included a variety of measures such as smart ticketing, the promotion of infrastructure for electric vehicles, bus and rail improvement measures along with infrastructure improvements for cycling and walking, and the promotion of car clubs.

The benefits of the projects funded in Tranche 1 will be felt at a local and national level in a number of ways. Firstly, there are schemes to provide more sustainable access to work. A good example is South Yorkshire's ""jobconnector"" bus service which will serve Grimethorpe, a former mining community with historically poor public transport provision and high unemployment. Delivered in partnership with local bus operators and businesses, the new service will link the community to employment areas in the Dearne Valley and will, we believe, become commercially viable after the Fund period.

In urban areas, congestion costs the economy around £11 billion a year. The Fund is helping us to tackle this problem with projects that encourage people to use public transport, to walk or cycle. Some also promote electric vehicles usage or the more effective use of private vehicles, and all help reduce carbon emissions.

Many projects will also revitalise local retail environments to attract inward investment. Better and more sustainable public transport will also help tackle problems such as air quality and noise, whilst improved cycling and walking infrastructure will help to combat the health problems associated with physical inactivity.

Empowering local authorities to create packages of sustainable initiatives that are tailored for their local areas is only the beginning. We have two further rounds of funding to come: one for a number of larger projects and of course, there's a second round of smaller projects for the Tranche 2 bids that you are here to discuss today.

To date, the standard of bids has been very high and I recently met with local representatives in Peterborough and York and to hear about their successful Tranche 1 projects. Peterborough's project comprises a package of innovative measures, including plans to work with local businesses to overcome the barriers to sustainable travel options, as Teresa Wood, Sustainable Environment Manager at Peterborough City Council, explains.

Teresa Wood, Sustainable Environment Manager at Peterborough City Council: The bid is a package of small to medium sized projects to increase sustainable travel in Peterborough that might range from awareness in schools to a major infrastructure project with the railway station.

Economically the benefits come from improved infrastructure through links with the city for bus and rail station making the city centre and surrounding areas much more accessible, not just for business, but residents and visitors. There's a number of initiatives that could generate new businesses:cycle hub.

There are barriers to business and some of those barriers can be helped by thinking about alternative transport measures, so video conferencing, the provision of grants for things like showers and lockers - what we hear time and time again - are barriers to people not wanting to cycle to work.

NB: The City of York's successful Tranche 1 project aims to reduce congestion and its impact on the environment by delivering an integrated programme of personal, business and school travel planning, combined with targeted infrastructure enhancements to increase people's travel choices. Councillor Dave Merrett explains how the bid will boost the local economy:

Councillor Dave Merrett: We're a small historic city, we have a lot of congestion, the economic impact is £37 million per annum, a hell of a lot of money. So if we can get a large proportion of people on bikes etc, then we can relieve congestion issues and allow us to expand the city and reduce our carbon footprint as well.

We plan in investing in the north and north east quadrant of the city, improving cycling routes, tackling difficult junctions.

The biggest block to cycling is fear of traffic and dangers and tackling difficult junctions. Providing on-route cycling facilities where roads are narrow etc, all help make it clear that cyclists are about. Stop lines at junctions so cyclists can stop and get in the right position and move off before other traffic - all those sorts of things actually make it easier for cycling. Also providing off-road sires so people who are only willing to use off-road, extending the network here and there starts providing a comprehensive network that people love using - we have routes through some really beautiful open spaces along rivers etc it actually a joy to use those routes.

NB: The Department received 41 expressions of interest for Tranche Two small project funding, with full proposals due for submission by 24 February 2012, and has invited a further 15 local authorities to revise bids presented during 2011 for Tranche 2. I intend to announce successful projects in this second round by the end of May 2012.

All proposals need to demonstrate financial sustainability with benefits enduring beyond the life of the Fund. They also need to incorporate a credible delivery plan, and include a commitment to make a local contribution to the project.

Overall, the Fund has been well received and I have been impressed by the quality of bids and the commitment of local authorities, and I'm especially pleased to see many new authorities rising to the challenge and promoting sustainable travel options. Indeed, all eligible local authorities across England have now applied for funding, either as a lead bidder, or as a partner authority. And I am confident that each and every successful project will prove to be effective in addressing our two key objectives - that of creating growth and cutting carbon.

I hope you find today's workshop helpful in developing your Tranche 2 bids. I look forward to receiving more high quality proposals in February and in the meantime wish you all the best with the development of your bid.

I'm sorry I can't be with you today, but I would like to thank the Trees and Design Action Group for giving me this opportunity to talk to you about the importance of trees in the urban environment.

Two important documents are being launched today - Trees in the Townscape, and a report on the findings from the UK i-Tree Eco pilot project. This event also marks the launch of Neighbourhoods Green's Tree Management Toolkit - a web-based source of advice which promotes well managed green space in housing estates.

We tend to take trees for granted and that's maybe why we need organisations such as the Trees and Design Action Group. We need to be reminded on how tree planting can enhance urban environments and that the protection of existing trees is just as important. It's worth noting that the advantages of trees are in proportion to their size - large mature trees bring more benefits than smaller ones do.

The Department for Transport has long recognised the value of trees and other planting in urban environments. In 2007, the Manual for Streets was published, this focused on the design of residential streets. In 2010, the Chartered Institution of Highways & Transportation published a key piece of complementary guidance - Manual for Streets 2 - Wider Application of the Principles. It extended the original Manual for Streets principles to fill the gap between residential streets and trunk roads.

Both documents represented a radical change in approach to street design, and both recognise the value that trees impart to our daily lives. They emphasise that trees bring a wide range of benefits to individuals and to society as a whole.

First and foremost, trees contribute to character and distinctiveness, they create visual interest, more importantly perhaps, they help improve the air quality, and they help to soften the street scene. In essence, they are an excellent place-making tool in urban design.

But, their potential contribution goes beyond that. Trees provide habitats for wildlife and they have a role to play in climate change. They can provide shade and reduce the local environmental temperature. They can also slow down the rate at which rainfall enters the drainage system. The recent floods have highlighted the importance of good surface water management, and trees can play their part here.

As a driver, I am in no doubt that a lovely avenue of trees makes a journey more pleasant, whether in a town setting or in the countryside. The French certainly understand this. I recommend the old main road from Dieppe to Paris, still with its lines of trees but delightfully much freer of traffic. And I am proud that, before I was a minister, I stopped the Highways Agency from cutting down a wonderful run of mature trees along the central reservation of the A27 in my constituency of Lewes. They were concerned that they could be dangerous for any motorist veering off the carriageway. I am happy to say they agreed to my suggestion for crash barriers instead, and so the trees continue to give pleasure to thousands of motorists day in, day out.

On top of all this, trees make financial sense. The economic, environmental and social benefits arising from street trees vastly outweigh the cost of providing and maintaining them. The i-Tree report being launched today is testimony to this.

But how can we turn all of this into reality?

The target audience for Trees in the Townscape is decision makers, especially local councillors who are setting out policy. So a good starting point is to take heed of the 12 key principles that ""Trees in the Townscape"" puts forward. They form a sound basis for any local authority policy on street trees.

Putting these principles into action does rely on a considerable amount of collaborative working between various disciplines and interested parties, in much the same way as Manual for Streets 1 and 2 strongly advocate.

Hopefully, designers will already be familiar with what the Manuals say about trees, but it doesn't hurt to remind them that planting should be integrated into street designs wherever possible. And they should remember that the early involvement of stakeholders often pays dividends - for example, relatively minor scheme adjustments such as slightly realigning a carriageway to avoid a mature tree, could cause all sorts of problems if that same adjustment comes as an afterthought late in the design process.

But collaboration needs to take place at all levels. In March, I launched the opening of the Greater Bristol Bus Network scheme. With support from the Government, Bristol City Council worked with Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Councils to create a reliable bus network for the 52 million bus journeys made in the Greater Bristol area each year. The results are impressive but I particularly appreciated the attention given to street trees. £1.2 million was earmarked for additional landscaping and this resulted in the planting of 500 new trees along 10 key bus routes in the city.

As I mentioned earlier, the Department for Transport has long recognised the value of trees and other planting in urban environments. When you look at the myriad benefits street trees bring about, it becomes obvious that the advantages cut across the interests of many different parts of Government. My hope is that close inter-departmental cooperation on this issue in the future means that we will see more trees in our towns and cities.

Thank you for listening and please accept my wishes for a successful launch event for these three important sources of advice.

I am sorry not be with you in person today, but I am glad to have the opportunity to talk to you about how the coalition government is positioning Britain as a global leader in the design, production and use of electric and ultra low emission cars.

In the short term, the majority of CO2 savings from road transport will come from improvements to conventional technologies, driven by EU regulations on fuel efficiency.

But here in the UK we are also preparing for a much more fundamental change:

We are already seeing ultra-low carbon vehicles being driven on UK roads, changing the face of motoring. We are fully behind this change - putting in place the incentives to needed to establish a market for these pioneering technologies, supported by a favourable tax regime.

Thanks to our ground-breaking ""Plug-In Car Grant"", which gives motorists a 25% subsidy up to £5,000, new ultra-low emission cars are more affordable. There are ten eligible cars which are, and will be, on our roads.

Worldwide, there is strong demand for these new vehicles, with the UK a key early market for manufacturers. As of 30 June 2011, 680 cars had been ordered through the scheme.

Our objective has always been ""real"" grants for ""real"" cars - cars that are safe and reliable; cars that meet the needs of motorists and provide a motoring experience that's at least as good as, if not better than, the conventionally powered vehicles they currently drive.

In June, we published a comprehensive electric vehicle infrastructure strategy that identifies how a national recharging network can develop in a way that is targeted, convenient and safe.

The strategy sets out how we are ensuring that plug-in vehicles are an attractive choice for the motorist, how we are making it easier for individuals to charge at home, at night, after the evening peak in electricity demand and how we will make it easy for individuals to locate and use public chargepoints. We are also making it easier to install recharging infrastructure by removing regulatory barriers.

The National Planning Policy Framework went out for consultation in July. The framework encourages local authorities to implement policies to include recharging infrastructure in new domestic, workplace and retail developments.

And, through our £30 million ""Plugged-In-Places Programme,"" we are establishing a network of vehicle recharging points in eight areas across the UK - from homes and workplaces to streets, car parks, retail and leisure facilities - to support the new wave of electric vehicles that are coming to market, and to allow us to learn more about how consumers use charging infrastructure.

The programme has already more than trebled the number of recharging points in the UK. Indeed, 15 per cent of drivers now live in local authority areas that have Plugged-In Places funded publicly accessible charging infrastructure.

And, of course, we want the UK to benefit from the business opportunities of ultra low carbon cars. We want green growth. We want UK businesses' efforts to seize commercial opportunities in this sector and are supporting them in doing so.

So Nissan is building a plant to manufacture its electric vehicles and batteries in the North East - and others will follow.

Meanwhile, Chargemaster and Ecotricity have recently both announced plans to build privately-funded networks of thousands of recharging points at motorway service stations and other locations across the UK by next year.

These are really exciting developments. I hope I have given you a taste of the potential here and that your conference today gives you the opportunity for a stimulating debate about the changes ahead.",Transcript,norman-baker,,Department for Transport,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,reducing-co2-and-other-emissions-from-transport,,27/09/2011,,

Norman Baker, Minister for Local and Regional Transport: Thank you, Stephanie. You can listen to it on the internet too if you're particularly enthusiastic about that.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's a great pleasure to be with you here today as part of this prestigious ceremony on your 15th anniversary. You'll be pleased to hear that I'll be brief and to the point. As Lord Reading once said on these occasions, ""Always be shorter than anyone dared to hope,"" and of course in this audience I'd better keep to time, had I not? Today's event's a celebration of achievement in an industry that plays such a critical role in British life yet doesn't receive enough recognition for the contribution it makes. Buses are the backbone of our public transport system, accounting for two-thirds of all public transport journeys made; that's because they are becoming, and have become, an accessible, user-friendly and affordable alternative to car travel, providing an essential public service at the heart of almost every community in Britain, linking people with friends and families, schools and hospitals, shops and leisure facilities.  And let's not forget the important role that buses play in helping to tackle congestion and reducing pollution from road transport, so let me assure you that as Local Transport Minister I will support the bus industry as a vital part of our wider transport programme.

As John said in his introductory comments, it's clear that there are challenges ahead, and I recognise that - I don't underestimate them - but our central aim, our guiding light, is quite clear and it's simply this: we want more people on buses to help people get to work, to help people who don't have access to a car, to cut the carbon footprint of transport, and that's why in our recent spending review we retained BSOG, contrary to what you might have read in the newspapers beforehand, albeit with a 20% reduction from 2012 onwards.

Now, while I appreciate that any cuts will be unwelcome and every sector of the economy has had to make a contribution to tackling the wholly unsustainable debts that the coalition inherited on coming to office, but our decision on BSOG which offers benefits, I hope, represents a good result for the bus industry, for the passenger and for the taxpayer, and, I might say, reflects a bit of effective lobbying.

Back in June I told the House of Commons that the benefits of the grant are clear, and they are: helping to keep fares affordable, attracting more people onto public transport, incentivising fuel economy.  I meant it then, I believe it now, and that's why we have retained the grant.

Now, John, you also mentioned the issue about concessionary fares, so perhaps with this distinguished audience let me just say something quickly about that. Local authorities have a legal obligation to compensate bus operators fairly for taking part in the concessionary fares scheme. The mantra is no better, no worse off - that's the principle. That principle remains, nothing has changed, and the same approach will continue to be followed in appeals. The Secretary of State's office-appointed representative will, in determining appeals brought to him, take account of DfT guidance, but, most importantly, will apply the law relating to the compensation of operators to ensure that local authorities fulfil their obligations to ensure that operators are no better and no worse off; that has not changed.

We also want to support the industry through a Government-wide commitment to localism. Localism works and it works particularly well for transport, that's why we recently announced our new £560 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund with the high level objectives of creating growth and cutting carbon, something the bus is very well placed to capitalise on. The fund will support partnership working, will simplify funding streams and enable local authorities to bid for money to address their transport priorities. Making the bus more attractive to passengers is clearly something which will qualify for funding under this new regime.

I also believe it's the Government's job to help the industry innovate, that's why, for a start, we're investing in low carbon buses to help decarbonise transport in the years ahead.  The [Green Bus Fund](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/green-bus-fund/#) will enable bus operators to local authorities to purchase around 500 new hybrid and electric vehicles operating in many of our main cities, and some rural areas, by March 2012. My hope is that this fund will kick-start the market for low carbon buses and technologies, and I was very pleased when I visited the Bus Expo in Birmingham recently to learn how well this initiative has been received by the industry. Second, we are fully committed to ruling out smart card technology. We've recently provided £20 million of grant funding to the nine biggest English urban areas outside London to support smart integrated ticketing across the country, and we of course, we have retained the BSOG smart card incentive; this is very much our agenda for the future.

But back to today: I would like to thank every local authority and operator who's responded to the initiatives we've brought forward, but, indeed, also for the work they are doing to promote the bus and bus travel across the country, and that means congratulating every short-listed entrant today, because all of you have excelled in one way or another over the past year and the excellence we are celebrating today provides a foundation, I believe, for a secure future for the bus industry and you do, in my view, have a secure and a good future, and a vital future if you'd help the Government realise its objectives of creating growth and cutting carbon.

Thank you very much for inviting me along today.

## Transcript

I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak to you today. Although I can't be with you in person, I wanted to support this important conference, and make a contribution through the wonders of modern technology.

Living in the area, I have seen firsthand the valuable work done by the community transport sector in East Sussex. I was pleased recently to visit my local CTA in Newhaven and I would like to thank all of you who give up your precious time to serve your communities on a volunteer basis.

The theme of today's conference is Transport for Life. In my view that means transport that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable, both today and in the long-term.

It also means transport that helps the community and improves people's lives - by providing access to jobs and services; by encouraging more active travel choices such as cycling and walking; and by improving accessibility for people who live in socially excluded areas - be that deprived housing estates in our largest cities or isolated rural communities.

We made it clear in the Coalition Agreement that we will support sustainable travel initiatives - and that means making our transport systems cleaner and greener.

So, for example, we are supporting the development and delivery of low carbon vehicles like electric cars.

But we also want to change the way people travel, to connect different travel modes more effectively, to reward greener travel initiatives, and to link transport policy to other local issues like health.

Cycling, for example, is not only cheap, but can help tackle rising levels of obesity - with long-term knock on benefits for the NHS.

So we will support schemes that encourage more cycling - in and around schools, and around important transport hubs like railway stations.

Local travel planning and Smarter Travel plans - particularly when they include cycling and walking - will play a larger role in helping people to get fit, and in reducing the travel bills of hard-up families.

I should take this opportunity to reinforce our view that local transport plans remain the best way for authorities to plan transport strategy and delivery. We will ensure that funding allocations are available in good time for completion of those plans by next April.  Local transport plans efficiently and effectively enable local councils to focus on the main priorities - supporting the economy and securing carbon reductions, but also on road safety, affordability and accessibility, and improving people's health and well being.

I am a passionate believer in localism; having been an East Sussex County Councillor, and Leader of Lewes District Council and indeed a Parish Councillor, the latter for 16 years - though I don't feel as old as that would imply!

That experience has not only made me committed to local government, but has also given me real insight into how the system can be improved.

I used to find it deeply frustrating that many of the things we knew we wanted to do were restricted by central Government - or needed Ministerial approval.

So in line with the Government's commitment to localism, my Department is no longer seeking to intervene in the way local authorities review progress against local transport plans.  No more obligatory reports or invasive reviews. As far as we are concerned, they will be entirely a matter for the council.

Broadly speaking, what we want to do is help councils to prioritise transport schemes that offer the best outcomes to travellers and passengers, taxpayers, businesses and the environment.

This desire not to dictate one method over another, but instead allow local people the freedom to make the right decisions for their communities, extends to public transport, which plays such a vital role at local level.

You know better than anyone how best to organise community transport - for example using taxi-buses, dial-a-ride minibuses and other solutions.

A great example of this is Cuckmere Community Transport, operating in my constituency, which provides bus services to local people - by taking them to the doctor's, or shopping, for instance, or providing bespoke transport to support local events. It is run on a totally voluntary basis, and the volunteers' fantastic work was recognised in the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2006.

I recently met with the Community Transport Association nationally, which we support with funding and who do a great job in supporting and promoting the community transport sector. I know they would like to see more local authority services tendered together, giving them more of an opportunity to produce more effective, efficient and integrated bids.

Community transport could really benefit from this approach: how much more efficient would it be for you to be able to make school runs in the morning and the afternoon, and then operate patient transport services in-between?

That is why I wholeheartedly support measures to expand charities and social groups and involve them more in the delivery of public services.  And why I think it is important that local authorities open up services to new providers, like charities and social enterprises, so we get more innovation, diversity and responsiveness to public need.  I stress, however, that this should not be seen as an opportunity for local authorities to walk away from their responsibilities to ensure the delivery of essential public services, including transport.

Of course, buses remain the predominant form of public transport.  They are also the form of transport used by those with lower incomes.  So it is important for social, economic and environmental reasons that we get more people on buses - and that is what we intend to do.  Operators like Brighton & Hove, which will be celebrating its 75th anniversary later this year, are showing the way by working in partnership with the local council to make buses more attractive and reliable through, for instance, the use of real time information at bus stops. This kind of partnership working is exactly the sort of thing we want to encourage across the country.

But we also want to get a fairer deal for the taxpayer and a fairer deal for the farepayer. £2.5 billion of public money is spent on buses each year, so it is right that we question whether the bus market is delivering value for money and a good service to passengers. Bus fares increased by 25% above inflation between 1997 and 2009; perhaps unsurprisingly, patronage in England outside London fell by 5% over the same period. At the same time, bus operators are making profits that are on average higher than would be expected in a competitive market (a return on the capital employed of between 12 and 20 per cent versus a cost of that capital of between 8 and 11 per cent).

That's why I welcome the current Competition Commission Inquiry into the local bus market.  The Commission is best placed to deal with the difficult questions about the level of competition between bus operators and whether the current regulatory framework for buses is the right one.

Buses are key to the delivery of properly sustainable local transport.<
That is why we recently announced another £15 million of government funding for a fleet of low carbon buses, which we estimate will save 50,000 tonnes of CO2 over a 15 year period.  More importantly, I hope it will drive the market for such buses so they become much more widespread across our country.

Railways are also very important, but the cost of the UK's railways is relatively high - both in historic terms and by comparison with other European networks. So Sir Roy McNulty is carrying out for us a Review of Value for Money on the railways. Perhaps that might help unlock funds for good local rail schemes such as the reinstatement of the line between Lewes and Uckfield.  We are also consulting on the future of rail franchising policy, as we believe longer franchises could help improve services for rail customers.

Something that links rail and buses - and something I am keen to see happening more quickly - is the roll-out of smart ticketing. It offers huge potential benefits for passengers, local authorities and operators, which is why the Government has made £10 million of funding available to 9 big cities outside London to encourage this roll-out. And I am very keen to incentivise operators and local authorities to do more.

We underestimate potentially the value of getting ticketing right in terms of securing modal shift.  But I will also be challenging the train, bus, cycling and car hire industries to improve facilities for integrated journeys, and to focus more on the whole journey, from end to end. There is a lot of good practice already on integrating the different modes of transport but I would like to see more.

Finally, and perhaps perversely, you might think, I am also very keen to encourage people not to travel!

Why? Because we can reduce congestion and overcrowding, and cut transport emissions, by asking people and businesses to question if every journey is really necessary.

Imagine the benefits if more people could work from home, say one day in ten, or if more employers helped staff stagger their commutes, and break out of the usual 'nine to five' routine.

I was pleased to see my role as Minister for Alternatives to Travel welcomed recently by both the Confederation of British Industry and the Campaign for Better Transport who described it as a ""huge step forward"". So there we are, it's a bold policy that makes sense - and that is what this Coalition government is all about.

More broadly, of course, we also face a huge challenge tackling the debt crisis - the worst in this country's peacetime history.

That means cutting wasteful spending, and getting better value for every pound of investment.

Had we not taken action we would, at the end of this Parliament, be spending £70 billion a year on interest payments alone.  That is simply completely untenable so we had to take quick action.

The way I describe it is like if you are running a car which is dangerously low on oil and if we carry on like that the car would eventually explode.  You have to stop the car, top up the oil, give it a service, and put it back on the road.  That is what we are doing at the moment to try to make sure we can go forward on a sensible basis.

Part of the solution is trusting in localism. That's why we are devolving power from Central to Local Government, and then on to communities, neighbourhoods and individuals. So local services can be maintained, and local economies can be supported.

I certainly don't underestimate the role that Community transport plays in this process - helping local people and local economies at this difficult time.

You have a vital role to play in providing effective transport that contributes to better communities.

And I thank every one of you for the difference you are making every day.

Thank-you for listening, and I wish you good luck for the rest of your conference.",Transcript,norman-baker,,Department for Transport,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,making-transport-more-accessible-to-all,,20/10/2010,,

## Transcript

I'm sorry that I can't be with you at your conference today, but thanks to video technology, I'm delighted to be able to make a contribution to this important event, even if it has to be from afar. However, this helps me to promote another part of my ministerial brief - namely alternatives to travel.

But when I do travel, I'm a regular user of taxis and private hire vehicles. They are two vitally important forms of transport and so I can speak to you from a passenger's perspective as well as that of a Minister!

The Coalition Government is committed to localism because the best form of government is one that lets people govern themselves.

If decision-making is devolved and power dispersed, problems are more easily defined and better solutions can be found.

Better taxi services can never be delivered through a one-size-fits-all approach. Every local community is different.

So, if they are to be efficient and profitable, then taxi services must be designed to meet the specific of needs specific local communities.

As well as offering bespoke services, localism also means ensuring value for money.

In all of this, you have a very important role to play. I think there is a standard of service to which all passengers - whether in a small rural village or a large city - should be entitled to expect and receive.

And I recognise that the legislative framework is complex and it is very old, but - importantly - it does provide you with the tools for ensuring that drivers and vehicles are properly assessed and tested.

From my perspective, I want to know that drivers have been properly assessed, that they know where they are going, that the vehicle is safe and - my own personal predilection - that I have adequate ventilation in the vehicle.

And I have no doubt at all that you undertake your responsibilities in a diligent way with the public safety objectives at the forefront of your minds.

The public rely on you to ensure that their journeys are safe and comfortable. And it's not only local people; visitors to the area also rely on the convenience of taxi travel.

Taxis services often provide them with their first impression of a new town or city. The trade, and you as regulators, have an important role to play in ensuring that those first impressions are positive ones.

However, most of you will, I 'm sure, have seen in the national press that I encountered problems of my own when using a taxi recently in Liverpool.

The driver simply couldn't understand my directions, the postcode I gave him or the map I showed him.

That is unacceptable.

The ability to communicate with passengers is a fundamental pre-requisite for carrying out a service of this nature.

Therefore I urge you incorporate in your driver assessment an ability to communicate with passengers, whether as part of the topographical knowledge test or whether as a self-standing test before an applicant proceeds to the next stage of assessment.

And, on the theme of driver assessment, let me stress the importance I attach to thorough background checks.

I'm particularly uneasy about the idea of applicants with convictions for sexual offences being granted licences.

I know that you are all waiting patiently or maybe even impatiently, for the outcome of the Government's reviews on criminal record checks and the safeguarding vulnerable groups scheme.

Let me assure you that the Department for Transport is feeding into the reviews. We know that you want a consistent and rigorous level of check and we are making those views known to colleagues in Government.

However, I would sound a note of caution about over-regulating - and I am thinking here more about elements of vehicle licensing.

Is it really necessary for the taxi owner with tinted windows to get them all replaced?

Is it really necessary for the owner of a vehicle with seven or eight seats to remove one or two of the seats?

Taxi and PHV owners and drivers are working in a difficult economic climate. The costs they incur in meeting the regulations you set and the conditions you attach, really matter to them.

That is why I would take this opportunity to commend the Department's Best Practice Guidance.

Its key message is - ensure that any regulation you impose is commensurate with the benefit you want to achieve.

Passenger safety also relies of course, on your rigorous enforcement efforts. And, properly licensed drivers rely on you to provide them with a level playing field.

In this difficult economic climate, it must be tremendously tempting for unlicensed individuals to go out touting for the evening in an unlicensed vehicle.

Or for the owner of a licensed vehicle to lend it to an unlicensed friend or relation for a shift.

Quite possibly that's what happened to me in Liverpool.

If you haven't already thought about using mystery shoppers to assist with the enforcement and ongoing monitoring role, then you might do so.

Most drivers in the district - and unlicensed individuals - probably recognise your team of enforcement officers a mile off - where as anonymous individuals reporting back to the licensing authority can provide a better perspective.

Let me turn now to the most topical issue of the day - the Equality Act 2010.

You will have seen guidance notes from the Department about the taxi elements that came into force on 1 October.

Imposing duties on drivers to assist passengers in wheelchairs represents a whole new approach.

It was clear from consultation responses received by the Department last year that disabled people wanted to see driver duties implemented as soon as possible.

The Equality Act introduces the new concept of ""designated vehicles"" - the consequence of a vehicle being on the list of designated vehicles is that the driver must undertake the duties to assist.

The fact that the legislation gives licensing authorities a power to keep a list of designated vehicles means that licensing authorities are free to make the decision as to whether they do or do not maintain such a list.

However, I would take this opportunity to strongly urge licensing authorities to maintain such a list.

After all, the end product will be a better service for disabled people.

Over the coming months, you will be asked for exemptions from people who, because of their own condition or medical fitness, will be unable to comply with the duties to assist passengers in wheelchairs.

This is an important task and one which requires you to perform a delicate balancing act. It's important to retain good drivers despite their physical limitations. Equally, we must ensure that sufficient numbers of drivers are obliged to adhere to the duties so that disabled people actually reap the benefits.

Whilst on the subject of assisting people who use wheelchairs, I I believe the taximeter should only be started once a passenger is safely aboard.

Drivers who start their taximeter beforehand are effectively penalising disabled people in a completely unacceptable way. So I hope you will monitor this too in a vigilant way.

Many drivers are entirely familiar with dealing with people who use wheelchairs and do it every day without any problem.

But, some might  not be trained and so anxious about the new duties because they don't know what to do - even though they might have a tremendous willingness to help.

So I would urge you to take a pro-active approach in helping drivers to access the training they need.

I'm aware that the industry has been developing professional qualifications for taxi and PHV drivers and I'd like to see this good work continue.

More generally, we're still considering the commencement plan for the remaining sections of the Equality Act.

An announcement will be made when we know the details of the plan and you will be alerted through the usual channels.

In the meantime, apologies once again for my absence today, but I genuinely appreciate the valuable role which you play in keeping the travelling public safe.

And I hope you have a constructive and successful conference.

Thank you.",Transcript,norman-baker,,Department for Transport,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,,,18/11/2010,,

## Transcript

I'm sorry that I can't be with you at your conference today.

But, I have asked officials to deal with any questions that arise from your deliberations today, so please do collate them and send them on to us.

Anyway, I did want to take the opportunity presented by modern technology to send this message to you and indeed fulfil my brief as Minister for alternatives to travel.

Like many people, I am a regular user of taxis; they make life so convenient when, for example, you arrive in a town or city that you don't know very well.

So, as I said to the licensing officers association last week, I can speak to you from a passenger's perspective as well as that of a Minister!

The Coalition Government is committed to localism because the best form of government is one that lets people govern themselves.

If decision-making is devolved and power dispersed, problems are more easily defined and better solutions can be found.

Better taxi services can never be delivered through a one-size-fits-all approach. Every local community is different.

So if they are to be efficient and profitable, then taxi services must obviously meet the specific needs of specific local communities.

So what I really want to see is local regulation that allows you to flourish.

You know best what passengers want and you need to be able to provide a service that meet passengers' demands.

I recognise that you want to be able to do this is in a cost-effective way against the background of a harsh economic climate.

It was with your cost burdens in mind that I reminded the licensing authorities last week about the importance of ensuring that their local policies and rules are proportionate.

I reminded them of our Best Practice Guidance whose principal objective is to ensure that any rules or regulations imposed on the trade are commensurate with the objectives they are intended to achieve.

So, please make sure that you are familiar with the Best Practice Guidance - and don't be afraid to use it to challenge your licensing authority to justify their local policies.

Speaking to you as a taxi passenger, it is clear that you have a key responsibility for providing visitors and tourists with their first impression of a new town or city.

It is most unfortunate - and reflects badly on your trade as whole - when a driver cannot communicate and doesn't know where he is going.

As some of you may know from media reports, this happened to me recently in Liverpool.

The driver couldn't understand my directions or find the 34-storey building I wanted to be dropped off at even after I'd given him the postcode and a map. I am assuming this was an isolated incident and I was simply unlucky.

I know that the overwhelming majority of you take your responsibility as ambassadors of your local areas seriously and make the effort to ensure that visitors' first impressions are positive ones.

Passengers expect drivers to be able to communicate; they expect drivers to know where they are going and they expect to be safe during the journey.

So, the point I would make from mentioning this anecdote to you is that it is in your interests for your licensing authority to undertake a rigorous assessment of taxi driver licence applicants. It gives passengers the confidence they need to use taxis.

Let me turn now to perhaps the most topical issue of the day for you - the Equality Act 2010.

We published in September a [guidance note](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110203081758/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/regional/taxis/equality-act/) dedicated to the trade about the taxi elements of the Act that came into force on 1 October.

It is on the Department's web-site in case you haven't yet seen it.

One element of the Act which will be of interest to you is the new approach to imposing duties on taxi and private hire vehicle drivers to assist passengers in wheelchairs.

It was clear from consultation responses received by the Department last year that disabled people wanted to see driver duties implemented as soon as possible.

The Equality Act introduces the new concept of ""designated vehicles"" - the consequence of a vehicle being on the list of designated vehicles is that the driver must undertake the duties to assist.

The fact that the legislation gives licensing authorities a power to keep a list of designated vehicles means that licensing authorities are free to make the decision as to whether they do or don't maintain such a list.

I took the opportunity last week to urge all licensing authorities to keep a list of designated vehicles.

After all, the end product will be a better service for disabled people.

We recognise that some drivers will, because of their own condition or medical fitness, be unable to comply with the duties to assist passengers in wheelchairs.

That is why the Act allows drivers to apply to their local authority for an exemption from the duties.

And that is what came into force on 1 October.

We are still considering the commencement date for the actual duties; I will make an announcement when the plan is clear.

Whilst on the subject of assisting people who use wheelchairs, I would make the point that the drivers should only start the taximeter once a passenger is safely aboard.

Drivers who start their taximeter beforehand are effectively penalising disabled people in an unacceptable way.

I hope we would all want to treat disabled people in a sensitive and sympathetic manner.

Another part of the Equality Act which I know is of particular interest to you is the provision regarding the control of taxi numbers.

In those areas with quantity controls on taxis and very few wheelchair accessible taxis, it seems wrong that people who want to enter the taxi trade with a wheelchair accessible taxi should be denied the opportunity to do so simply because of the local authority's limit on taxi numbers.

The Equality Act targets areas which have a quantity control policy and only a small proportion of wheelchair accessible taxis.

It says that the licensing authority will not be able to refuse to grant a licence for a wheelchair accessible vehicle for the purpose of controlling taxi numbers until a certain proportion of taxis locally is wheelchair accessible.

I can assure you that we will consult before deciding what the actual proportion will be - we have to make special provision in legislation identifying the proportion and we shall take account of your views on what it should be.

But I think the principle is the right one - the door-to-door nature of taxi travel is ideally suited to people who use wheelchairs and I think this is a good way improve provision of wheelchair accessible taxis.

Before I leave this issue, just let me reassure you that nothing in this new provision about taxi numbers will require taxi owners to get new vehicles. If you are in an area with quantity controls and you have a saloon car, this will not force you to buy a new one.

Rather, it is all about giving opportunities to people who want to enter the taxi market with a wheelchair accessible taxi and simply can't get a licence.

I shall make an announcement in due course about our planned timescale for bringing this section into force.

I alluded earlier to the harsh economic climate in which you are working.

Against that background, perhaps I could take the opportunity to draw your attention to the flexible ways that you could offer your services.

By doing so, you could reap greater benefits for yourselves as well as providing a more flexible service for your passengers.

I am thinking particularly of taxi sharing schemes and taxibuses.

Taxi sharing schemes have the potential to benefit both the trade and the travelling public.

They can be set up in any area.

A licensing authority can choose to establish a taxi sharing scheme if it wants to do so.

But, importantly, it must set up a scheme if the holders of at least ten per cent of taxi licences in the area request it to do so.

Under a taxi sharing scheme, passengers travelling in the same direction each pay their own fare, which is less than the metered fare.

And the driver could take more than the amount which he would take for the same journey on a conventional exclusive hiring.

There is also the option of providing a taxibus services.

Taxibuses provide a flexible alternative to conventional taxis, particularly in rural areas where the demand for a bus service might be light, and might not justify the provision of a larger bus.

It involves getting a special public service vehicle operator's licence from the traffic commissioner and registering a route with the traffic commissioner.

These provisions provide you with a more flexible way of using your taxis, particularly those of you who use seven or eight seater vehicles.

And, in this regard, you might be interested to know that I also expressed my concern to licensing authorities about local policies which require taxi owners with seven or eight seater vehicles to remove one or two of the seats.

There is no real justification for this - all it does is to restrict your ability to provide the sort of service which you have identified and which you want to provide.

So, have a think about whether these initiatives would suit your area; there is information about them on the Department's web-site.

Once again, I am sorry that I cannot be with you today.

However, I certainly recognise the valuable role which you play in overall transport provision.

And I wish you a constructive and successful conference.

Thank you.

## Transcript

Hello. I'm sorry I am not able to join you in person today at the British Parking Association's President's Reception.

I am glad, however, to be able to say just a few words on this occasion, albeit remotely.

Firstly I would like to congratulate the BPA'S outgoing President, Paul Necus on an excellent year in office.

It has been a year of change and progression in the parking sector.

Paul and his colleagues in the BPA have worked with professionalism to drive up standards in the sector.
There are two areas I would like to mention in particular.

Firstly the Protection of Freedoms Act will, on 1 October, deliver on the Coalition commitment to end Private sector wheel-clamping and vehicle removal.

I am very happy to have brought this measure into effect. It puts to an end practices that have caused distress to many and done the image of the parking industry as a whole no favours.

At the same time, to balance the rights of landowners and motorists, we have legislated to introduce keeper liability for parking on private land.

We made clear that this would only happen if the industry acted to improve standards and put an independent appeals service in place.

I am very pleased to say that the BPA has risen to this challenge on behalf of the parking sector.

As a result I am increasingly confident that the new independent appeals service and the keeper liability provisions will both take effect on 1 October, helping to provide a fair balance between the rights of landowners and motorists.

Secondly I would like to mention Paul's focus on disability and accessibility over the last 12 months - subjects I know are close to his heart.

The BPA's focus and support of the new measures we have introduced to tackle abuses of the Blue Badge Scheme, something which Baroness Grey-Thompson spoke eloquently about last year, has been welcomed by Ministers.

Now let me turn to the year ahead.

I think the industry can look forward with confidence. The BPA is lucky in that they have an excellent new President, in the form of Anjna Patel, whom I welcome.

Anjna's track record in the parking sector is impressive, and I am sure she will enthusiastically drive forward a powerful agenda to further raise levels of professionalism and skills in the industry.

It will certainly be another busy year ahead in the parking sector.

We will see the new arrangements for parking on private land come into operation.

The new Independent Appeals Service will start to operate - guarding against unreasonable practices and the setting of extortionate charges by less scrupulous parking companies.

The reforms to the Blue Badge scheme are now being fully implemented. Enforcement officers should start seeing more and more of the new badge design in use and be able to make use of innovative technology delivered through the Blue Badge Improvement Service.

I'd like to encourage enforcement teams to set up and use this new facility

We will also be driving forward our deregulatory programme in areas such as traffic signs, and generally reducing unnecessary burdens and provide more flexibility for local authorities.

And of course we will continue to encourage more authorities to take over the civil enforcement of parking to deliver increased compliance, reduced congestion, and freeing up police time.

I look forward to working closely with you all, and indeed with the British Parking Association in general, in the year ahead.

Thank you, and I hope you all enjoy the reception.",Transcript,norman-baker,,Department for Transport,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,,,19/07/2012,,

Narrator: A small piece of Amsterdam came to Leeds when Norman Baker, Minister for Local and Regional Transport, and the Dutch Ambassador, His Excellency Pim Waldeck, formally opened the UK's first cycle point, a highly innovative facility for cyclists at Leeds Station.

Norman Baker, Minister for Local and Regional Transport: This is a big first for this country. It emulates what's happened in the Netherlands. We can learn from our Dutch colleagues - I'm very pleased the Dutch Ambassador's here today - and what it demonstrates is the potential for combining rail travel with bike travel, getting people on their bikes to complete the last part of their journey. It is a place where you can leave your bike, it's a place where you can hire a bike, it's a place where you can get your bikes fixed. It's a, kind of, one-stop shop for bikes, and it's the sort of service, I think, and the sort of message which sends out to people here that bikes are centre stage.

His Excellency Pim Waldeck, Dutch Ambassador to the UK: The Dutch railways, in combination with the Government, have developed a network of cycle points in the various main railway stations where you can hire a bike or can: you can store your bike.

Steve Butcher, Chief Operating Officer, Northern Rail: So it was just a fantastic opportunity to have a similar type of cycle point in Leeds that brings a bit of Amsterdam into Leeds itself, and also means that it opens up a whole range of people being able to come into the city.

NB: And if we're going to be serious about cutting carbon emissions we have to start with behavioural change for short journeys, and this is a classic example of what can be achieved, and I very much think it will be a success. It's already proving to be that in the first couple of weeks of operation, and I think it's the sort of thing we should be doing across the country.

Narrator: Sutton Community Transport is a registered charity working in the London boroughs of Sutton and Croydon. Last year it won a number of home-to-school contracts from Croydon Council and obtained working capital funding from Futurebuilders. Norman Baker, Minister for Local and Regional Transport, formally opened the charity's impressive new vehicle depot and offices at Beddington Lane.  He was keen to emphasise the importance of community transport.

Norman Baker, Minister for Local and Regional Transport: Well, if we didn't have community transport then there'd be a whole range of people in society who simply wouldn't be able to get anywhere, so it's a tremendously important function, and this is a very good example of what can be achieved in undertaking a huge number of journeys for different people of different varieties and needs, and this is a particularly good model because it actually requires no public funding.  By undertaking contract services which are paid for, that subsidises the services which need to be undertaken for community purposes.  So it's a really good example of what can be achieved.

Mike Skinner, Chief Executive, Sutton Community Transport: In Sutton it's about 47,000 passengers a year that we carry.  It tends to be a combination of older people, many with disabilities, and younger people.  We do: also do a lot of work for schools, so there's a whole age range from five through to 95.  We do a lot of work for about 20: 25 schools in Sutton.  That tends to be outings, day trips, care homes, sheltered housing, to allow them to go out to the countryside or go to the coast in the summer.  So it's a whole range of things.

Sue Robson, Co-Founder, Sutton Community Transport: The realisation today is the vision that we had in place then and that, actually, I wrote that bid based upon.  So it's just great for me to come back here today and see the realisation of what, 15 years ago, started so small and now it's doing all of this for so many vulnerable people in Sutton and the surrounding area.  It's just brilliant.

NB: We're very keen to see community schemes such as this. We support the community transport sector very strongly. I've met them already on a national basis. They do a tremendous amount of good work and fit in exactly with the sort of localism and Big Society the Government wants to encourage.

## Transcript

Hello and thank you for inviting me to give the keynote address today and my apologies for being unable to attend in person. Thankfully this isn't due to bad weather conditions; instead, I am in Birmingham today for the Liberal Democrats' autumn conference.

However, like all of you here, I take the issue of being prepared for winter very seriously indeed. Extreme weather conditions often mean people can't get to work; deliveries of raw materials, food and retail goods are hampered; businesses struggle to function; schools can be forced to close and emergency services may be unable to carry out their vital duties.

So it is essential that we do everything possible to keep key transport infrastructure, like our road and motorway network, operating efficiently and safely as possible.

The first spell of winter weather arrived early last year, but thanks to the actions that were taken both by central and local government; we were in a much more resilient position than in previous years. This is in spite of winter 2010-11 being the UK's third cold winter in succession and the Met Office confirming that December 2010 was the coldest December since 1910 and that the snowfall encountered was the most widespread in any December since 1981.

And we weren't the only ones to experience travel disruption, other European countries, even those who are more accustomed to severe winters, faced a similar plight.

But it seems clear that disruption here in the UK would have been far worse without the rapid action taken to implement the recommendations of the Quarmby Review, published following the severe winter of 2009-10.

Actions that we took included having a strategic salt stockpile in place, which some local highway authorities were invited to bid for when we suggested they were running low on their own salt stocks. We also developed a salt stock portal to carefully monitor how much salt stock local highway authorities held and published advice to help local authorities make the best use of their salt supplies. For the general public, we produced a common sense guide so that shop keepers and residents who wanted to clear their paths could do so without having to worry about falling foul of health and safety law.

All of this appeared to work well, but we asked David Quarmby to follow up his earlier review with an urgent audit. This looked at the performance of highway authorities and other transport operators in England and how they coped. I was pleased to learn that the main Audit concluded that across the transport sector many did admirably, keeping roads open and public transport running. But it was also clear that there were still lessons to be learnt and there is certainly no room for complacency.

So, as this winter approaches, the Department will continue to hold a strategic salt stock pile to overcome the re-stocking challenges faced by local highway authorities as they exited winter 2009/10. This said, I was pleased to see that the results of a recent restocking salt audit undertaken by the Department revealed those challenges are not as apparent. The results suggest that authorities have been placing orders with their salt suppliers and are receiving the necessary stocks as we enter the winter season.

We will also recommence our electronic stock monitoring and my thanks go to those involved in assisting with this last year and hope that they will continue to provide the necessary updates as and when my officials request them.

But it isn't just a question of authorities having sufficient salt stocks. Consideration must also be given to getting the most out of those stocks. A good starting place would be the spread rates research we issued in December 2010 and I understand that you will be hearing more about this from TRL.

In turn, the positive impact of local communities working together during extreme weather episodes should never be under-estimated. Last year it was heartening to see the thousands of kind spirited people, businesses and other support organisations, who swung into action to help others, particularly the most vulnerable members of our society. Whether it was parents keeping schools open by shovelling snow and ice from pathways, or people checking on their elderly neighbours to see if they were safe and warm, every day brought practical examples of the Big Society in action.

The Department is currently working with the Department for Communities & Local Government, and the Local Government Group, to pull together best practice examples of snow and ice clearance. I hope to see this disseminated to all local highway authorities in England by October.

We've done everything we can to ensure local authorities are ready to take the lead in tackling the winter challenge and I hope that the recommendations from the various Quarmby reports have been fully taken on board to ensure that robust winter service plans are in place and on standby - and that includes liaising local communities, businesses and other stakeholders both prior to and throughout the winter period.

When winter is as cold and hard as last year's, then how, when and where we travel will always be affected and disrupted to some degree. That is unavoidable, even in countries that regularly experience the harshest winters. What really matters is the speed of response, the effectiveness of mitigation measures and the time it takes for transport networks to recover.

These are the key components of any winter resilience strategy worth its name and, by learning the lessons of the past and proactively planning for the future; this Government has put them at the heart of its strategy. So, while I take nothing for granted when it comes to the Great British winter, I believe we are better prepared to deal with its transport challenges than for many a year. Apologies once again for not being able to join you today, but thank you for watching and I hope you have a productive and enjoyable day.",Transcript,norman-baker,"Ricoh Arena, Coventry",Department for Transport,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-roads-safer,improving-local-transport,,27/09/2011,,

Hello.

I'm really sorry I can't be with you in person today. None-the less, this is an important event dealing with important issues and I really did want to find a way to take part in it.

So thank-you for giving me an opportunity to say a few words through the wonders of modern communications technology and, indeed, for helping me to promote another part of my brief - namely alternatives to travel.

My Department is focused on building a modern and sustainable transport system - one that connects our communities, supports our economy and protects our environment. But, as you'll understand, that is a real challenge when set against the backdrop of the country's enormous inherited debt crisis.

On the spending plans we inherited, British taxpayers would each year be paying out £70 billion in debt interest payments alone by the end of this Parliament - that's more than we spend on educating our children, defending our country or policing our streets.  To use a motoring metaphor, the public finances inherited by the Coalition Government resembled a car that had been running dangerously low on oil. We have had to stop the car, top it up, give it a service and get it back on the road in a fit state to take us forward.

So the Government's top priority is to tackle that legacy of debt. And a watershed moment in our efforts to put the public finances back on track will be the autumn Spending Review. But the challenge of the Spending Review is also an opportunity - an opportunity to reassess and re-evaluate priorities in transport spending.

Local highways will, of course, be no exception to this process. But make no mistake - we know our local highways matter. They are not simply a vital part of the wider transport network, they are the most valuable transport assets that a local authority will own. Unfortunately, they can also be an easy target for cuts. Well, given that local roads help to support social and economic goals, both of central Government and local authorities, unthinking cuts all too often are a false economy.

Let me give you some good news. This Government is committed to localism, to letting councils get on with they job for which they were elected. Under this Government, local authorities will have greater freedom to spend money where it is needed. In other words, you will be able to focus and target capital investment on those areas that offer the very best returns. And the indications are that investment in highways maintenance not only offers real value for money for taxpayers, it also produces benefits for the travelling public in lower vehicle operating costs and faster travel times.

I'm sure that everyone here today will know that, in March this year, CIPFA  published a new code of practice on transport infrastructure assets. This will begin to affect local authorities in a very real way from 2012/13, when the current replacement cost of their highways assets begins to appear in their accounts. And, while, at first glance, the change may seem to be a challenging one, it also offers genuine benefits to local authorities because the evidence base for the budget decisions you take, and the consequences of those decisions, will be much clearer to you, your Council Tax payers and the wider public.  All in all, better decision making.

The new code will mean that if local authorities fail to invest in their highways networks the impact on asset values will be plain for all to see. There is a mandatory dry run in 2011/12 So, while I have the chance, I want to tell you that it's not too late to register for the launch event that CIPFA are running on 19th July in London at the Treasury.

Asset management is an important tool for delivering efficiencies. Indeed, CIPFA themselves estimate that somewhere in the order of 5% a year worth of savings can be achieved. So, in an age where all of us must learn to do more with less, making the best use of existing assets is often a better choice than spending on new build. Put simply, keeping up investment in highways maintenance, even in testing times, makes economic sense, not just transport sense. That's the reason that I, and the Secretary of State, were united in ruling out any cuts in the money for repairing pot holes - a stitch in time and all that.

Local roads are so much more than highways that take you from A to B. They are also where people live, work and shop.

So when we plan, when we devise policy and when we debate and discuss the key issues, we should consider each and every stakeholder - from car drivers to pedestrians, and from local residents to local businesses.

We should also think about the contribution local highways make towards sustainable travel. After all, making a journey by bike or on foot - two forms of travel that are good for our health as well as good for the environment - would be a lot more difficult without properly maintained roads and pavements. And the same is equally true when people come to use public transport like buses, or join car clubs. Both modes of travel help to cut carbon emissions but both depend on decent roads.

Our approach to local roads is rooted in this Government's commitment to localism. For us, the new politics we have promised is one where the best form of government is the government that lets people govern themselves. That's why, in the Coalition Agreement, we have pledged to a review of local government finance - something that will give greater financial autonomy to local government.

It's also why, in the Queen's Speech, we announced the Devolution and Localism Bill. This important Bill will shift power from the central state back into the hands of individuals, communities and councils. It will empower local people giving them more power over local government. And it will free local government from central and regional control so that they can ensure services are delivered according to local needs.

It doesn't make sense for local councils to have to fill in endless forms, to bid for this or that pot of money, or to seek clearance from central government for actions that you are well capable of deciding for yourselves. We are going to deal with that.

Okay - I know you have a packed schedule. So it just remains to me to thank you for listening and to wish you an enjoyable and productive day. I look forward to working with you all in the months and years to come - thank you.",Transcript,norman-baker,,Department for Transport,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,,,20/10/2010,,

Hello. I'm sorry I can't be with you in person today. However, I'm delighted to be able to address you with the aid of technology - something which also fulfils another part of my ministerial brief, namely that of Alternatives to Travel.

I thought I'd begin by sharing the following thought with you. Frances E. Willard, who, in 1895, wrote How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, said this: ""She who succeeds in gaining the mastery of the bicycle will gain the mastery of life.""

Never a truer word said because although I doubt she preached her biew in the context of health, we now know that cycling has many benefits, not least of which, are the benefits to our health. Just 30 minutes of moderate physical exercise per day can have a tremendous positive impact on health, reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, strokes and some cancers, as well as improving mental health. Indeed, if it were discovered today, cycling might well be called a miracle cure.

This is one reason why I'm keen to see a new generation of cyclists come forth and Bikeability plays a key role in making this hope a hard reality. I am glad to say that most local authorities play a leading role in its delivery, so making it a truly national scheme. To those local authorities here today that don't currently participate in delivery - I would urge you to do so. The children in your schools and their parents will thank you. Learning to cycle safely and confidently on today's roads is crucial if the bicycle is to become a more important part of how people get around in the future, as I want it to be, and if we are to create a next generation of committed cyclists.

And to prove the point, some research on Bikeability training recently published by the Department revealed that:

  * Bikeability training is rated very highly by both parents and children  - with over 95% responding positively
  * Children who have taken part in the Bikeability scheme feel safer and more confident when riding on the road
  * Just as importantly, their parents feel more confident allowing them to do so - because they consider that their children's' ability to judge risks on the road has been improved by the training.

It's 5 years since Bikeability was first launched in Leicester. Since then tremendous progress has been. Positive interest in Bikeability is at an all time high amongst members of Parliament, as I know only too well, having responded to a number of Parliamentary Questions recently. And I'm delighted that I can be so positive in my replies regarding funding and delivery.

This year, the Coalition Government has followed through on its commitment to support sustainable travel, including cycling. We've maintained the cycling budget for this financial year, which includes £11million for Bikeability training - that's enough to train 275,000 additional children.

For next year and beyond, we have created a new Local Sustainable Transport Fund, worth £560million over 4 years.  This fund will be available for all sorts of cycling initiatives, and specifically will be used  to support Bikeability for the remainder of the Parliament, with no reduction in the current annual spend. I hope this clearly demonstrates our strong commitment to cycle training to all concerned.

Many of you here today have played a part in making Bikeability the success it is. The message I have for you today is that ""the best is yet to come"".

I will soon be offering cycle training grants to over 100 local authorities outside of London to deliver Bikeability training in 2011/12.

I will also be continuing to offer grants to schools through the Youth Sport Trust and their network of 400 + School Sports Partnerships.

This funding is vitally important in those few areas where Bikeability is not delivered by local authorities or where authorities alone cannot meet local demand. And I'm grateful to the many School Sports Partnership managers who have helped increase the delivery of Bikeability, by developing their own Bikeability schemes and trainers.

There is of course much more to Bikeability than just the cycle training that goes on in our schools. It's underpinned the National Standard for cycle training -which is the ""gold standard"" for training. I believe it's only right that our children are taught the best road craft and on-road skills by the best instructors, and we will continue to develop and improve the standard.

By allowing only registered schemes to deliver Bikeability this ensures consistent training around the country. And it may interest you to know that we recently registered the 300th scheme and there are many more to come.

We also have more than 5,000 fully qualified and assistant National Standard instructors. And recently we announced the first successful ""Independent Training Organisations"" - which the Department recognise as high-quality providers of instructor training. This will ensure Bikeability training remains consistent with the requirements of the National Standard, namely, promoting excellence in training.  We'll also continue to support and fund the Cycle Training Standards Board, which oversees the National Standard.

Somebody once said of the bicycle ""It's the first machine we master as children and the one we abandon when the seductions of the car take over."" With a significant revival of interest in cycling, this is no longer true. And by supporting the continued growth and development of Bikeability, we're giving our children the skills needed to cycle more safely on modern roads.

Once again, my apologies for being unable to attend in person, but I wish you an interesting and stimulating day. As you develop cycle training strategies around the country, do so in the knowledge that you are leaving a lasting legacy of high quality cycle training to all our children. And I wish you all every success in doing so.

Hello, I'm sorry that I can't be with you at your conference today, but thanks to video technology, I'm delighted to be able to make a contribution to this important event to mark the first conference for the Association of Bikeability Schemes, or TABS as you are commonly referred to.

The Coalition Government wants to encourage people to make more journeys by sustainable, carbon-friendly modes of transport, of course including cycling. Cycling brings many benefits, and as a government we are keen to encourage its uptake as a healthy and enjoyable transport choice for the individual, which also helps to ease congestion and cut carbon for society as a whole.

[Bikeability](http://www.dft.gov.uk/bikeability/) plays a crucial role in both encouraging and enabling individuals to cycle and it is important that the next generation of cyclists is well prepared with the skills and confidence to ride safely and well on modern roads.

Learning to ride a bike is not just about safety - although that's important - it's also a life skill. It's about gaining independence and broadening knowledge of your environment. Exploring and getting to know your local area by bike was a part of growing up for me, as it happily is for many.

I can well remember the excitement I got when my dad provided me with my first bike when I was a young lad back in Aberdeen and the freedom it gave me to cycle round the streets of the town and exploring places I had never been to before. I also recall my father arranging for a police officer to come and give me cycling proficiency training in my back garden, something I found intimidating at the time but I think it stood me in good steed ever since.

I also recall my first day in the Department for Transport, when I asked my Civil Servants how it was possible to get from the Department to the House of Commons for a vote given that it took ten minutes or so to walk over and the division bell gives you eight minutes to arrive. I found the answer was to have a chauffeur waiting downstairs with a car, no doubt with the engine running, that's been now stopped. I now have use of the departments Brompton which gets me across to the House of Commons in speedy time when neccessary

My Ministerial colleagues and I firmly believe in the value of cycle training, especially for children. That's why we have committed to fund Bikeability for the remainder of this parliament to ensure that many more thousands of children will receive the solid grounding to set them up as lifelong cyclists.

On the 11th April, I was also delighted to confirm that as well as the £11m of grants agreed for this year, a further £24m will be allocated by the Department for Transport over the following two years. This includes an extra £2m to support expansion of the scheme on top of money originally earmarked for Bikeability. Additional local contributions worth an estimated £11.5m are expected over the next three years.

I am also pleased to be enabling the delivery of a wider range of training to a broader age range of school children between years 5 and 9. Level 1 and 2 training are a good start and lay the foundations but Level 3 can give the budding cyclist the skills and confidence to carry on growing and to ride on all roads where cycling is permitted. That's why we have loosened the grant rules to allow Level 3 training.

Now Bikeability simply wouldn't exist without the dedication of the many instructors and Bikeability schemes. It may of course be a wonderful job on a bright sunny afternoon, but I'm equally aware it can be less wonderful on a cold, wet, windy morning.

Bikeability celebrated its 5th birthday in March and I think it's important to celebrate what we together have achieved. Initially there were around 18 local authorities delivering fewer than 8,000 training places.

We now offer grants to 108 Local Authorities and 65 School Games Organiser Host Schools. Current DfT funding levels make it possible for at least 275,000 pupils to be trained every year and we expect to see the 1 millionth pupil trained before the end of this parliament.

Behind this success are over 6000 registered national standard instructors and more than 360 Bikeability schemes delivering training nationwide.

The next stage in Bikeability progression is the cycle training industry organising its own industry body, something I am very pleased to see. This marks an important step in the maturing of the industry and it will be useful to us to be able to hear your collective voice through TABS. Thank you for being involved.

As well as providing a voice for the industry, we recognise the important role TABS can play in supporting and maintaining quality assurance. It's important we get this right so that we remove the obstacles for those who are hesitant to take part in cycling, either for themselves or for their children. We also know that it can be difficult to get into secondary schools for all sorts of reasons, but we hope with your persistence, this can change over time too.

That's why Quality Assurance is so important: people have to believe that Bikeability is delivered to a uniformly high standard and that their children are getting professional, well-delivered training. We know standards are high, but we all need to keep striving for continual improvement.

At the DfT we have a big part to play in other areas too. Making drivers more aware of cyclist needs, improving road design, making cycling a normal part of the transport mix, these are all things we can help with and which we are actively working on. Local councils have their part to play in this agenda too.

Bikeability is a success. The UK is ahead of other nations in this area. We should be proud of this, but not complacent. But I know that TABS can help make what is already good even better. That is your challenge.

My thanks go to TABS for putting together this excellent event. I am looking forward to working with you to ensure the continued delivery of high quality cycle training.

Thank you for listening to me and I wish you a great conference.

## Transcript

Thank you for inviting me to the Built Environment Networking Event today.

I appreciate that a video is not entirely within the spirit of networking. I had hoped to be there with you in person, but as you gather this afternoon in Yorkshire, I am in Birmingham for the Liberal Democrats' autumn conference. An event which, as I am sure you will appreciate, is not to be missed, and not just because for me it is compulsory!

But I still wanted to be able to speak to you today. So with due allowances for the format, please let me take this opportunity to explain the Coalition Government's approach to rail.

First, some context. As specialists in the built environment, you will understand very clearly the importance of establishing the foundations before a project can get off the ground. That is the challenge that the Coalition Government has inherited in terms of the economy. We need to tackle the deficit if we are to create the conditions for renewed prosperity.

But we understand very well that carefully planned infrastructure can drive economic growth. So we have been clear that we will continue to invest in projects that deliver a real benefit. No return to the days of cancelling essential infrastructure, banking a quick saving, then finding that the economic cost in terms of stifled growth is far greater than what was saved.

So the Coalition Government is fully focused on building a modern transport system - one that connects our communities and supports our businesses, one that is safe and reliable, affordable and accessible. And, of course, we are determined that such a system will also play its part in contributing to the Government's climate change goals.

In terms of investment in rail, and in spite of intense pressure on the public finances, the Government is undertaking probably the biggest programme of rail enhancement since the Victorian era. These include a green light for both Crossrail and Thameslink in its entirety, an ambitious electricfication programme and the provision of 2700 new carriages which will make travelling more attractive and help ease overcrowding.

But as Sir Roy McNulty's report earlier this year made clear - and as most have long believed - the cost of rail is indefensibly and unsustainably high.

That is not to detract from the real achievements of the rail sector in terms of safety and reliability that we have seen in recent years. But for far too long, the railway has relied on ever-increasing public subsidies on the on one hand, and ever-rising rail fares on the other.

This is hurting passengers, freight operators, and the public purse; but it's hurting the rail industry itself, and Britain's economy. So it needs to be tackled now. The challenge of building a sustainable and competitive railway cannot be delayed any longer.

That's the overall context: rail is an economic enabler and as such, the Government is supporting it as never before. But rail cannot continue in the unenviable position of being up to 40% more expensive per passenger mile than our European competitors. Later this year, we plan to publish a detailed policy statement setting out how we will take this agenda forward.

As the Minister whose responsibilities include local and regional transport as well as rail performance, I would like to give you some sense of what our policies for rail mean in a regional context and in particular, Yorkshire.

First of all, in this context it's relevant to mention our consultation on proposals for a high speed rail network. As we outlined in the public consultation, the Government's vision for high speed rail is of a truly national network - a 'Y' shaped high speed rail network that connects London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, with intermediate stops in the East Midlands and Sheffield and links to Heathrow and HS1. This has the potential to generate benefits with a net present value of £44 billion, and will contribute to major regeneration programmes in Britain's inner cities.

The consultation on the Government's proposals for HS2 closed on the 29th of July, and I hope that many of you took the opportunity to respond. We are currently considering the responses to the consultation. The Secretary of State will announce his decision on whether to proceed with HS2 at the end of this year.

But the existing rail network in Yorkshire is also to benefit from continued investment. The Midland Main Line is to gain a package of line speed improvements costing £69m which will cut journey times between Sheffield and London by eight minutes to around two hours. I know there are long-held ambitions to electrify the Midland Main Line. Those will be considered as we plan for Control Period 5.

Yorkshire is also a potential testing ground for concepts that are new to UK rail, such as the tram train pilot planned for the route between Sheffield and Rotherham which I have the green light to earlier this year and which the West Yorkshire PTE is considering on some routes into Leeds.

Yorkshire's local transport authorities and their partners are also thinking about how rail services are delivered and exploring new possibilities. From the centre, there are things that those in the region can do that will help us all.

Perhaps the most important thing is to be clear about how priorities for transport meet the challenges of economic growth, carbon reduction and reducing the cost of the railway. Clarity of purpose and the regional interests speaking with a single voice also count for much.

We are already talking to the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive and to PTEG about possibilities for devolution of rail interests - something that chimes well with the McNulty proposals. However, any proposal will need to achieve the objectives of providing better services for passengers as well as reducing the cost of the railway. And any governance structure would need to have the support of participating local authorities and local enterprise partnerships for it to work.

I hope this brief overview has left you with a good idea of not only the challenges, but also the real opportunities for rail. We are at a pivotal moment for the rail industry. I believe that, with your help and that of the many professionals who are central to the industry's success, there is no reason to suppose we cannot overcome the cost issue and continue to see the sort of expansion that has characterised recent years.

Thank you for watching and I hope the rest of your day is productive and enjoyable.

## Transcript

Narrator: Manchester's Metrolink trams are an iconic part of the city's transport network. For more than a decade, they've provided a quick and convenient service for the travelling public. And the network is set to expand following the Government's decision to reapprove over £120 million of funding for the Ashton and East Didsbury extensions. Norman Baker, Minister for Local and Regional Transport, experienced the network for himself when he came to formally open the newly-expanded Queen's Road depot. The depot will play a crucial role in stabling and maintaining the Metrolink fleet, which is expanding from 32 to 80 trams.

Norman Baker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport: I'm very pleased that one of the first decisions of the new Government has been to confirm the money for the extension to the Manchester Metrolink, and of course £10 million of Department for Transport money went towards this particular depot. So this is a sign of confidence in light rail, and it's a sign of commitment from the Government to the north-west. There's no doubt that an extension to Metrolink here in Manchester would help the local economy, it will help cut carbon emissions and be well received all round.

Narrator: Councillor Ian Macdonald is delighted that approval for the extensions has gone ahead.

Cllr Ian Macdonald, Chair, Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority: The extensions will spread out the network in a way; they're going to different places, new places, and tying it all together in a much more coherent way. And if people can be persuaded to get out of their cars and get on the tram, then that's very much better for everybody.

## Transcript

Good morning and thank you for inviting me to speak today. Unfortunately, due to the constraints of Parliamentary business, I cannot be with you in person. Nevertheless, with a little over four weeks to go before the Government's consultation on a strategy for high speed rail draws to a close, I was anxious to contribute to the debate.

The Government believes that a national high speed rail network from London to Birmingham, with onward legs to Leeds and Manchester, will transform Britain's competitiveness. With massively improved journey times giving better connections between key cities, it could reshape Britain's economic geography.

Indeed, the economic benefits are many. For example, a London to West Midlands line would help create around 40,000 jobs near four stations. That includes thousands of jobs from the regeneration of Birmingham's Eastside area. But this isn't the only way business could benefit.

Research commissioned by Northern Way suggests that a lack of connectivity between major northern and Midlands conurbations has left them as isolated islands instead of single functional economic areas. Improved connections could help those cities work more effectively as a coherent whole. More jobs could result from the increased productivity that comes from merging labour markets and customer bases.

There are also distinct advantages in connecting the Midlands and the North with Heathrow. Improved access to international markets would almost certainly enhance their attractiveness to international investors.

So better connections, new jobs and regeneration, but high speed rail is also vital for another reason. Britain's Victorian railway system, once the envy of the world, is becoming overstretched.

Long distance journeys have risen by five per cent year-on-year for well over a decade. By 2043 we estimate the total number of long distance rail trips to almost double. Today people find it difficult to get seat at peak times. Tomorrow, it will become more and more difficult to just get on a train, let alone have a seat.

The West Coast Mainline - the UK's busiest long distance rail route - is under particular strain even after the recent upgrade, which cost almost £9 billion, Network Rail says the southern end of the line will be effectively full by 2024 and it isn't just passenger trains occupying the track. Significantly, around half of all UK rail freight uses this line at some stage in its journey. This is an important consideration given the freight market is forecast to grow by up to 11 percent per year between now and 2030 and the need to secure modal shift of freight from road to rail for carbon reasons.

So transferring long distance journeys to high speed rail would free up existing lines to run more commuter, regional and freight services. Places like Coventry could even end up with more local rail services while freight could benefit from a 50 percent increase in capacity.

There are also potential environmental benefits to high speed. In the London to West Midlands phase, our proposals are broadly carbon neutral. However, the rewards really come in stage two, when the network extends from London to Leeds and Manchester.

Reducing journey times between those cities by up to an hour would enable rail to compete even more strongly with air and road. As many as 6 million air trips and 9 million road trips a year could shift onto rail with the Y network. And the overall carbon benefits from high speed are set to grow as we continue to make progress on decarbonising our electricity supply.

Having spoken about the positive benefits of high speed there are of course, impacts too. The Government is fully aware of the fears people have about the impact high speed rail could have on their homes and communities. That is why mitigation is a key element within our plans.

The importance of fully balancing the wider benefits of high speed rail with the impacts on local landscapes and communities is paramount. Last year the Secretary of State walked part of the line of route and, as a result, over half of it has now been refined. We've also been listening to the views of the communities that believe they might be affected and will reduce the local impact of high speed rail wherever possible.

To that end, more than a mile and a half of 'green tunnels' have been added to maintain local access as well as minimise noise and visual impact. Large sections of the route have been lowered into deeper cuttings or tunnels. Consequently, the number of properties where high noise levels would be expected, has fallen from 350 to around 10.

Importantly, if our proposals go ahead there will be more opportunities to influence the final design at the Environmental Impact Assessment or hybrid Bill stages. That thought brings me to the final part of my message today. Like you the Government believes it is important to listen to local people.

Before the consultation, HS2 Ltd spoke to 12 separate local authorities to understand the best way of engaging local people and we're now in the midst of one of the biggest consultations ever undertaken. We've written to the occupiers of 172,000 properties, held 41 days of roadshows and heard what almost 30,000 people have had to say.

We've listened and we've learned. Should we decide to go ahead, we'll keep on listening. We would run further roadshows on the Leeds and Manchester legs of the route, and also look to learn from our experiences this time round.

As I said earlier, the Government believes high speed could have transformational effect on communities across country. It would boost capacity on our networks, promote business, boost employment and has the potential to benefit the environment as well. In total, it would bring around £44 billion of economic benefits.

Yet we won't do anything until we've heard all of your views and if you haven't already done so, I would urge you to take part in the consultation. It runs until the end of July and getting involved couldn't be easier, simply log on to our high speed rail website for more details.

Once again, my apologies for not being with you in person, but Jonathan Mitchell from our High Speed Rail team at the Department is with you today and he will be participating in the question and answer session at the end of this morning's session.

Hello, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you this evening.

While it would be good to meet you all in person, a virtual appearance allows me to demonstrate what I like to call the fifth mode of transport. As well as rail, air, sea and roads, we also have a further option - alternatives to travel.

So while it might appear as though I am about to launch into, ""Good evening Azerbaijan - Here are the votes of the UK jury"", this is actually me demonstrating my commitment to an important aspect of my Ministerial brief!

You are gathered this evening in the impressive setting of the National Railway Museum, which preserves the best of our rail heritage.

It's always tempting, surrounded by the physical reminders of past rail innovation and talent, to reminisce about a golden age of railways in this country. Defining just when that golden age began and ended is of course half the fun.

But I have a different proposition for you. The golden age of Britain's railways is right now. After years of decline, the Government is pressing ahead with an ambitious set of rail projects that is bigger in scale than anything attempted here for over a hundred years.

Because the case for rail investment is overwhelming. We've seen massive growth in passenger numbers over the last 15 years. Even the economic traumas of the last four years have scarcely put a break on the ever rising popularity of rail travel both passenger and freight.

So, notwithstanding the overriding need to press ahead with tackling the deficit that has been reduced by 25 billion over the last two years, the Government is determined not to repeat the mistake made in so many previous downturns. That of putting on ice the rail investment that can actually enable the economy to grow.

Obviously there have been some very difficult decisions on issues such as VAT and welfare reform, but we've been able to commit £18 billion to rail in this spending review period.

So as well as our plans for transformational high speed rail, we're delivering the Thameslink programme; electrification of key routes in the north of England and on the Great Western line; massive redevelopment of stations like Birmingham New Street and Reading; and the first elements of the Northern Hub project.

That's in addition to around 2,700 new carriages, including the Intercity Express Programme.

And significant improvements to the light rail networks in Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham and Newcastle, plus my announcement earlier this month of the Tram Train pilot between Sheffield and Rotherham. Not forgetting the long awaited upgrade of the London Underground.

What's more, nearly a quarter of a century after it was first mooted, Crossrail construction is now well underway.

Crossrail is the biggest construction project in Europe and tunnelling under central London began earlier this month. Crossrail provides a vitally needed uplift to the capital's public transport system and a crucial new link to our nation's busiest and most important airport.

As well as improving life for passengers, all of this adds up to a period of historic opportunity for the rail industry and those who supply it.

But investment alone cannot prepare our railway for the future.

We learnt from the last government that simply spending more and more on public services is no guarantee of success.

Investment must be accompanied by change and reform, with a clear focus on improving the passenger experience and reducing costs.

It is only through reform that we can respond to understandable passenger concerns on fares.

If the rail industry is to earn the 'right to grow' highlighted in Sir Roy McNulty's report on value for money, it is essential that costs come down.

There's already some progress.

Network Rail is due to deliver £1.2 billion of efficiency savings by 2014 with at least a further £600 million expected by 2019.

But more needs to be done.

By 2019, we want the industry to close the full £3.5 billion efficiency gap identified in the McNulty report.

It's clear that none of us can deliver the change we need in isolation.

All too often in the past, governments have either imposed their own plans for reform on the railway, or simply set targets for the industry to achieve without giving them the means to do so.

In contrast, we have sought to build a consensus for change using a collaborative approach. Because we believe that working effectively together is essential if we are to achieve the modern, affordable, efficiently-run rail network that our country needs.

I am persuaded that the rail industry can have it all.

Tackling costs while continuing to grow.

Deliver high profile projects while moving passengers and freight across the network in unprecedented numbers, every day.

Cutting carbon and creating growth. So tonight look around and remember with a fondness a golden past but also celebrate the golden present as well.

When Jimmy Saville said it, it wasn't true. But it is now. This is the age of the train.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy the rest of the evening.

The Metro has become an integral part of the city's transport system, and this proposed scheme, through the city centre, will run to a new terminus outside the main entrance to Birmingham New Street Station. The aim is to not only provide a better link to the national rail network and help to reduce congestion, but also help towards regeneration and economic development.

As they develop the scheme, the Department for Transport will work closely with Centro, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, as they develop this scheme to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.

Hello and thank you for taking the time to attend today's conference on Smart Working and the Public Sector. I'm sorry I can't be with you in person, but thanks to video technology I'm delighted to make a virtual appearance, which of course also helps me to promote an important part of my ministerial brief - namely alternatives to travel.

This is, of course, why you're here today, to deal with the important issue of reducing demand to travel and finding smarter ways to work.

The challenge for all of us is clear. Transport is integral to supporting economic recovery, advancing social mobility and tackling climate change. Around a quarter of the UK's CO2 emissions come from transport, of which business related travel represents about a third. The public sector approach to procurement and work-related travel has a big part to play in demonstrating that better transport planning results in financial and environmental savings.

Now, although the greenest travel option is not to travel, it isn't my mission isn't to stop people travelling, but rather to ask everyone whether their journeys are really necessary.

This is now enshrined in Cabinet Office guidance for civil service travel. Cutting the demand for travel, or, at least spreading it, has obvious financial benefits - for the employer, the employee and indeed for the public purse. Is it really sensible to spend scarce public resource on transport infrastructure to meet capacity demand for just three or four hours each day? It also fits with the Government's vision to be the greenest Government ever and our own commitment to reduce our domestic business flights by 20% over the lifetime of the Parliament, in support of our carbon reduction target.

In the DfT we're using the Olympics as a catalyst for staff to think about how they can work and travel differently. And we're working with the rest of Government to encourage them to do the same. To reduce pressure on London's transport network during this period, DfT staff will be encouraged to do things differently, for example by working remotely or using video conferencing. As a result we are aiming to reduce our travel footprint during this period by some 50%.

I am aware that there is still much that we in central Government can learn about implementing new ways of working, we can learn from those companines and organisations at the cutting edge already taking a more innovative approach. This is why, back in April, I launched a call for evidence to find out more about what companies and organisations are already doing on alternatives to travel. We want to know more about what works - and what doesn't - what the barriers are and what Government can do to help. There are still a few more days for you to get responses in and I would encourage you all to contribute.

As part of the call for evidence, I have met with representatives from several public sector organisations with experience in this area.

They have provided me with a range of examples of smarter working in the public sector. Examples such as Winchester City Council whose use of IT enables 75% of its staff to work at least partly from home. This has resulted in significant cost savings and improved resilience, meaning that the council was able to operate effectively during the snow last winter with only 10% of its staff in the office.

Other good examples include the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance who are using Video conferencing to improve access to physics courses across 8 universities.

This agenda isn't just about promoting initiatives such as video conferencing and flexible working. It's also about fully considering the financial and environmental impacts of our travel demands and thinking about how we spend money, how we can save it and how we can achieve value for money.

For example, the Merseyside Fire and Rescue service now sends out firebikes ahead of their engines to confirm the status of the incident. And a team within the Avon and Wiltshire NHS Trust used their travel expenses budget to purchase electric bikes as a more cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative to claiming mileage.

Alternatives to travel is not just about using technology, but also about changing organisational culture - supporting and encouraging employees to embrace new technologies and different ways of working. And of course, a more flexible approach can bring significant benefits for businesses as well as their employees. As you will probably be aware, the Department for work and pensions has recently launched a consultation on flexible working and parental leave. I would encourage you all to respond.

I recognise that change isn't always easy. This is why assistance, advice and information aimed at encouraging and enabling smarter travel choices is being provided at a number of different levels. For personal travel choices, the Department for Transport's pioneering travel information and journey planning service, Transport Direct, provides lots of useful information. Not only can it plan routes and give likely journey times, it also calculates CO2 emissions and provides cost comparisons for door-to-door journeys by public transport or car to any destination in Great Britain.

In addition it provides a link to car-sharing companies and supports sustainable transport, providing cycle routes in 30 areas of Great Britain along with detailed walking directions and maps. I would like cycle route planning to become as mainstream as planning a car route.

The business community is being targeted through the National Business Travel Network, hosted by Business in the Community and grant funded by the Department for Transport. Its work seeks to influence organisations to support and encourage their employees to travel to, from and for work more sustainably and to reduce overall travel. They also provide a business forum that encourages and supports innovation and dissemination of best practice.

At a local government level, our new Local Transport White Paper, which I launched earlier this year, focuses on encouraging and enabling people to make sustainable travel choices for local trips.

An unprecedented £560m has been earmarked for local authorities through our new Local Sustainable Transport Fund. The first tranche of bids for small projects requiring less than £5million is currently being assessed. They cover a wide range of projects; including travel planning, facilitating walking and cycling, improving public transport and encouraging the sustainable use of private motorised transport.

Building on this approach, this year we are also making a grant £70,000 available to promote Alternatives to Travel in the public sector. My Department is in the process of seeking a suitable organisation to lead on this.

By working together I believe we can positively influence the travel choices people make for their personal and organisational needs and so reduce the impacts of transport.

Thank you for watching, have a good event.",Transcript,norman-baker,,Department for Transport,improving-local-transport,reducing-co2-and-other-emissions-from-transport,making-transport-more-accessible-to-all,,14/06/2011,,

Narrator: In 2009, up to 377mm of rain fell in Cumbria causing severe flooding in many places. The impact on the people of Cumbria was particularly devastating, as Tony Markley from Cumbria County Council explains.

Tony Markley: The Workington was cut off completely. People were completely taken away from their homes. Absolute devastation. Never seen it before. Three bridges went down here, the site where PC Barker lost his life, which was tragic, but the torrent of water that came down from the lake was just unbelievable.

N: When he visited the area, Norman Baker, Minister for Regional and Local Transport was very impressed by the rapid restoration of Cumbria's transport infrastructure with temporary bridges.

Norman Baker: I'm here with some good news for the people of Cumbria. The Government is providing £5.5million to enable essential work to be carried out to roads and bridges, following the terrible floods in this area. I'm determined to help Cumbria and help the regeneration of jobs up here and that's why £5.4million today is money well spent.

TM: It's great to see that DfT is continuing its support for Cumbria after the devastation that was held with the 2009 floods.

NB: This is a kick start for the local economy and the determination of the Government that if we can help to create jobs we will do so.

Narrator: Karley Smith, a third officer with Sealion Shipping, is this year's winner of the Officer Trainee of the Year award. The British merchant fleet is known the world over for maintaining the highest standards in shipping, and is managed by the United Kingdom Ship Register which is operated within the [Maritime & Coastguard Agency](http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/mcga-mgn), and, as MCA chief executive Sir Alan Massey explains, the training of young officers is very important.

Sir Alan Massey, Chief Executive, Maritime & Coastguard Agency: We've been running this competition for a few years now and we do it because although we're a safety agency we also run the British flag, so any British-flagged vessel comes under our auspices, and we're very interested in having a vibrant shipping industry that's populated with bright young people who come through, and provide the sort of career structure that exists, that makes British officers, you know, amongst the best in the world.  And so we're desperately proud of people like Karley because they do represent so much that's good about British youth and so much that's good about our shipping industry.

N: Karley studied at Blackpool and the Fylde College, sponsored by James Fisher and Sons plc, and trained with Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited.  So what inspired her to pursue a career in the Merchant Navy?

Karley Smith, Third Officer with Sealion Shipping: I wanted something that was varied, and I also wanted to study a degree course, and the year I applied they'd started running a foundation degree in nautical science, and it was all a brand new course, and I decided to give it a shot, see what it was going to offer, because there's no student debt attached to a qualification in the Merchant Navy when you do a cadetship, as a training company sponsors you through and pays for your training, your accommodation, and also gives you a wage.

N: Cadetships are a combination of academic study and practical work experience.

KS: It's split into phases so you do some phases at college and some phases at sea. You basically you learn some subjects and then put it into practice on a ship, come back to the college, learn more subjects, put that into practice on a ship, and then come back to the college in the end, do your exams, and then qualify as an officer, providing all goes well. I would recommend it because, as I said, it's so different. There's a lot of careers available - you don't necessarily have to stay at sea, there's a lot of shore positions available as soon as you have seagoing experience - and I think it's a good career to be in.

SAM: So there's banking, insurance, finance, ship-broking, all of those sort of supporting industries. London remains the centre of international shipping and long may it continue, and we do need people with the skills of Karley.

N: Minister for Shipping Mike Penning is keen to emphasise the importance of a strong and growing merchant shipping fleet.

Mike Penning, Minister for Shipping: I think it's hugely important: 96% of all imports come into this country and our exports that go out, come in by sea, so we are a world leader in shipping and we need to continue to do so, and this Government will support them in that.  And the reputation and the skills of our fleet, 1,600 ships plus now, and that's something we need to not only protect but grow, because if we're going to get out of this economic situation that we're in, then we need growth. We're continuing to support the training of young cadets coming through into the Merchant Navy, that's very, very important. Everybody needs their skills and their professionalism and their dedication recognised, and Karley won the award nationally, so that's why I brought her here to the Department of Transport, to the Shipping Minister's office. I mean, the Red Ensign is renowned around the world, you know. I'm not only responsible for the Red Ensign but also the British protectorate flag fleets. They are world renowned as great officers and good ships and that's something that I intend to continue.

KS: On most ships I've been on I've been the only female. It doesn't put me off in any way but I would like to see more females coming to sea, there's no reason why they shouldn't and there's no reason why they shouldn't want to do a career like this. They're certainly capable, so why not?

Narrator: Shipping Minister Mike Penning made a fact-finding visit to the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich. With a workforce of almost 3,000 and operating 24 hours a day, Felixstowe is the largest container port of the UK and one of the largest in Europe. Among the 4,000 ships passing through its terminals each year are some of the very largest container ships afloat today. Mike Penning went aboard the Ebba Maersk, which is capable of carrying over 15,000 20-foot containers.

Mike Penning, Minister for Shipping: A fantastic port, brand new facilities; been on one of the largest ships in the world, the ship we're standing on now, there's only eight of these in the whole world - thousands and thousands of containers coming in and off the ship. Manufacturing products coming in and out of this country shows the rest of the world that Britain is a place to do business with.

N: Forty per cent of the UK's high value container trade passes through Felixstowe and the minister emphasised how important Britain's ports are to the economy.

MP: They are massively important. If it's not manufactured or grown in the UK, 96 per cent of it, so nearly everything comes through ports like where we are here today, and on ships like we have here today. Massively, massively important for the economy of the country.

N: The minister also saw the work being undertaken to create the major new deepwater container handling facility at Felixstowe South.  He was then sped across the Stour-Orwell Estuary on a brand new pilot's launch to Harwich International Port. Harwich is not only a busy passenger and freight port, it's being used to service the development of the Thanet offshore wind farm which has brought new jobs and a welcome boost to the local economy.

Narrator: The Port of London is the second largest port by tonnage in the UK and it plays an important role within the economy of London and the south east. The Port of London Authority is the harbour and pilotage authority responsible for the safety of navigation on the tidal Thames, from Teddington Lock in the west to the Outer Thames Estuary in the east - a total of 95 miles. When Minister for Shipping Mike Penning made a fact-finding visit to the PLA's Port Control Centre at Gravesend, he was met at the Tilbury landing stage by a Harbour Master launch, one of several vessels that patrol the river 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Once in the control centre, the Minister saw first-hand how the PLA's vessel traffic services ensure safe, efficient and carefully co-ordinated vessel movements.

Mike Penning, Minister for Shipping: As the Minister for Shipping, I need to know and have the confidence that everything's being looked after, for instance on the Thames - and that, I've been shown today, is overwhelmingly true. They are fantastic and I'm very, very proud of them. We must make sure it's safe; also for people to have fun and pleasure on the river, and to make sure that we are an economically vibrant area along the Thames.

N: The Minister then boarded a purpose-built craft that can provide a prompt response to oil spills between Tower Bridge and Canvey Island.  Funded in part by the terminals that handle oil and oil products, it's managed by the authority and on standby 24 hours a day.

Narrator: Minister for Shipping Mike Penning undertook a fact-finding visit to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's Solent Rescue and Co-ordination Centre. Britain's Coastguard Service is kept very busy, as Chief Coastguard Rod Johnson explains.

Rod Johnson, Chief Coastguard: Her Majesty's Coastguard has an operating area which encompasses all 10,500 miles of the coast of the UK and about a million square miles of ocean - we go from nearly to the Arctic Circle out to mid-Atlantic and then down into much warmer waters. We deal with about 20,000 incidents a year and we're based at 19 sites that look pretty much like this one.  We deal with absolutely everything from sinking ships, fires and oil spills to lost children and dogs that get out of their depth - we deal with everything.

Mike Penning, Minister for Shipping: Well it's massively important and for people that live on the coast they do think of them with the other three emergency services. Their role, whether it be cliff rescues or sea rescues, or actually moving inland as well these days, is vitally important. That' what I was telling the people here today - how much we appreciate the service they do to the community.

RJ: This station' open 24 hours a day. We're in touch with a mariner; if they alert us to a distress then we will plot the position of that, devise a plan and allocate search units to it - they could be lifeboats from the RNLI, our own helicopter or our own brigade of Coastguard Rescue Officers. So the helicopter you've seen today is an Augusta Westland 139. It's equipped to deal with the kind of rapid fire incidents that we get down here.  It's very quick - 165 knots in still air - it can take up to eight people, has a dedicated crew of four and it's fitted with the last word in sensors and avionics. So it's a very capable, very modern machine.

MP: And this was a fantastic helicopter. I mean, the stability in the air, you can tell how safe it was. Now all helicopters, they tell me, are safe but when you fly in them you know the difference, and actually this was a fantastic helicopter and a great crew.

RJ: We are very highly regarded on the world stage. We operate at a very high standard. I'm constantly being asked to facilitate training opportunities from other countries. Our procedures have been adopted lock, stock and barrel by other countries. So we are a world leader at this.

MP: Their dedication is fantastic.  We should be very proud of them.

Narrator: Transport Minister Mike Penning is committed to improving the levels of service experienced by users of the Dartford crossing.

Mike Penning: The traffic and queues behind me on one of the countries most important junctions, pieces of infrastructure on our roads, tells you why I am here. Massive tailbacks, miles and miles of parked cars, parking, queuing, to pay £1.50. We've got to get the technology together to move it on, so we can have a better flow of traffic through here.

The design capacity for booths, where people are paying, they cannot cope with people taking money or going through machines trying to pay as you go through, that's just physically impossible to do. We need to make sure we get the flow of traffic throug.

N: A package of measures to help reduce the congestion at the crossing is now being considered by the Department of Transport and the Highways Agency. This includes free flow tolling technology that would enable barriers to be removed and so increase the speed at which traffic passes through.

MP: We don't need to reinvent the wheel, other countries have tried it..we've got the technology out of there, what we need to do is bring it forwards, stop saying how it can't be done and actually doing it, and that's what these people deserve.

Not question of if, but how this can be done to improve road infrastructure for the British motorist.

Reporter: The Government is aiming to positively change its travel by 50% during the Olympics to help manage demand on the capital's transport system. The Department for Transport is at the forefront of this initiative. Operation Step Change is designed to see how well we're prepared for the Games later this year. But it's not just staff who've been trying out new patterns of travelling to work. We caught up with minister Mike Penning outside the Palace of Westminster at 8.30 in the morning.

Mike Penning, Minister for Transport: Good morning.

R: Good morning. What brings you here at this time in the morning?

MP: Well, Operation Step Change means we need to look at our hours, get out of some of the traditional routines; so leaving home at 6.15 this morning into the Commons, and now walking across to the department.

R: How important is it for Government to lead when it comes to changing people's travel habits during the Olympics?

MP: Well, the capacity is going to be an issue, and so we need to make sure that we lead, we're showing how we can do it, how our civil servants can do it, and then we're not asking the public to do something that we're not doing.

R: We joined Secretary of State Justine Greening who was walking to Number 10 for a Cabinet meeting.

What brings you walking this morning?

Justine Greening, Secretary of State for Transport: Well, across the whole department we're trying to re-route, re-mode, re-time and just generally reduce our travel, so I'm re-moding at the moment.

R: Good, good.

JG: :and having a good old walk up to Cabinet, which does me a lot of good.

R: How important is it for Government departments to, sort of, set by example our need to change patterns of travel during the Olympics?

JG: I think it does matter, and we know it can make a real difference. And actually I think it can show people that really they might have picked one way of getting in to work, one time of going in to work, but actually there are options, and maybe if they take a little bit of time to think about it, they might actually have a more pleasant journey - I've certainly had a more pleasant trip up to Cabinet than I normally do.

R: Also attending Cabinet was Francis Maude, who had cycled to work.

Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office: I'm particularly keen this week, during Step Change, to get the bike out again, pump up the tyres and get going. Actually, it's great; you feel great afterwards - a bit puffed but it gets the circulation going. I think it's great. It's: actually it's about: it's a good thing to do anyway. We will need to do it for the Olympics and to explore in this week what are the different ways of doing it. But actually I'm really keen that over time, we in the civil service get better at people working a bit more from home sometimes, because that can ease congestion, can be better for people's lives; people can be much more productive if they are working a bit more of the time from home. So I think it's great that we've got the need, as well as the opportunity, to explore doing things a bit differently in future.

R: It's not just about travel, but the way we work and making use of the technology available. And that's why later on, Justine Greening and Francis Maude met face to face thanks to video conferencing.

Norman Baker, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport [excerpt from video speech]: Hello, and thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you today.

R: For Norman Baker, the minister responsible for alternatives to travel, re-moding isn't something confined to Operation Step Change; it's a daily pattern of working, and this includes pre-recording speeches on video.

NB: Well, I'm very keen to use this opportunity to record speeches remotely. First of all, it lets me get to audiences that wouldn't otherwise have a message from the department or from the minister. Secondly, of course, it's much better value than travelling maybe hundreds of miles to make a ten-minute speech. By doing this here in ten minutes, I can save ministerial time, I can save public money by not using transport, and we can cut carbon by not having an unnecessary journey. So it's all to the good; and this is the way, I think, we should be going: maximising our time, minimising our impact on the environment. But I think it is very important that all of us get in the groove of looking at matters in a different way, realising the value of remote working, of working in different, flexible hours, and approaching life from a different way. And I think those approaches have many gains to be got for the Government, many gains to be got for the environment and many gains to be got for the economy.",Transcript,justine-greening,"Westminster, London",Department for Transport,reducing-co2-and-other-emissions-from-transport,improving-local-transport,,,09/02/2012,,

## Transcript

Voiceover: The Government is committed to the development of ultra-low emission vehicles and, to encourage businesses to invest in plug-in vans, the Secretary of State launched the new Plug-In Van Grant, at an event held at County Hall in London.

Justine Greening: Well, we're announcing the plugged-in vans grant. That's saying that you can get up to 20% or up to £8,000 of grant towards buying a electric van or a hybrid van, and that should really help start to drive that switch from polluting diesel vans to more cleaner, greener hybrid and electric vans.

It's really important because we know that one of the key drivers of emissions in the UK, of course, is road transport, and particularly cars and vans, so if we can start to get that switch on to more ultra-low emission vehicles then that's really going to help us meet our targets.

Pete Waterman: The cost of diesel now is huge. So if you're going to save money - and, you know, being: you know, all this 'worried about the pound in my pocket', particularly as you get older; as you know, money becomes, you know, important to you - I think that, you know, is a viable option.

Justine Greening: Of course, for businesses it can make business sense too, because anybody who has filled up their van or their car with petrol or diesel recently knows just how expensive it is, so actually we're going to not just help the environment - this is about helping business too.

Paul Everitt: Ultra-low carbon vehicles are very much the future of the industry. We expect to see a transition to this type of technology over the coming years, and it's very important not just to meet our environmental challenges and targets, but also our industrial ambitions.

Dan Taylor: We've got a really big fleet - we've got the third largest fleet in the UK with around 12,000 vans - so for us it's really important that we look at all the options to make our fleet as green as possible and obviously as cost-efficient as possible. And with today's announcement around the grant, absolutely, it's beginning to stack up in terms of the numbers.

We've got a mission over the next 10 years to reduce our carbon footprint, and transport's going to be a massive part of that, so we've really got to decarbonise our transport. That's going to add up financially and economically, but also from the environmental perspective, we don't have a lot of choice to make this work. So we're proud to be leading the way, and as I say, we've got 150 vehicles to be on the road by the end of next year.

Justine Greening: What it shows is that business is starting to look seriously about how it can green its fleet. We know that's incredibly important; it's one of the reasons why the Plugged-in Places investment has really focused on the workplace - that's where people have their car and it can charge up whilst they're there. So business is really, really important, whether you're working at business or whether you're running a fleet, and that's one of the reasons why we're delighted that British Gas is, in a sense, leading the way.

Richard Deslandes: Each individual electric vehicle has its place, whether it's a 3.5 tonner or whether it's the inner city runaround like our own. I think they all have their place and we're all going to benefit from this: these initiatives.

Paul Everitt: We've got a number of products here that are produced in the UK; a number of the others also have technology that is being developed and manufactured here in the UK. So if we want to compete globally on the types of vehicles that we are going to be producing in the future, it's essential that we create a supply chain for those technologies here in the UK. And so the grant is part of that strategy. It persuades people that the UK's a good place to develop this technology, to demonstrate it, but in the long term hopefully manufacture it, and export it to other places around the world.

Richard Deslandes: I think that the electric van incentive is actually an essential part of developing electric strategy in a city, public utility companies, and so on and so forth, need this kind of boost.

Paul Everitt: For us this is a very important step. We hope to see a significant take-up of the grant over the course of the next well, not just this year but over the course of the next three to five years. And as we get that, and we build volume in the marketplace, then we will see the technology both improve but also reduce in cost.

Dan Taylor: I think, the grant that's announced today, together with some of the additional benefits, things like the congestion charging, et cetera, in London, really begin to help make the case stack up. So we're fully behind it.

Richard Deslandes: What is interesting is that continental Europe looks with certainly slightly green eyes at the UK, where there is, I think, a serious level of joined-up thinking; whether it comes from OLEV, or whether it comes from the EV Group at the SMMT, whether it comes from plugged-in places, whether it comes from the Mayor's initiatives, I think there's some serious joined-up thinking in the UK which the rest of the Europe would do very well to emulate.
