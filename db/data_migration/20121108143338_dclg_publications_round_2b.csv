It addresses some of the popular myths surrounding street parties and sets the record straight on what is actually needed (including on road closures, charges, playing music and insurance) as well as providing links to external organisations who offer support and advice to those looking to organise their own street parties.

The guidance includes a model street party form showing the sort of information local authorities will need to know about the event, but you can also access your own local authority's guidance and form via Directgov.

Local authorities are being encouraged to support local residents in bringing down any barriers that stop local areas from holding small private street parties.
