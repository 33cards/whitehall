  * Bus passenger journeys in England increased by around 15 per cent between 2004/05 and 2008/09, a period in which the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme was introduced. Growth was greater in London, with a smaller increase in the metropolitan areas outside London over this period.
  * Since 2008/09, passenger journeys have remained broadly flat, with continued growth in London offsetting a gradual decline in passenger numbers outside London.
  * Though figures for individual quarters should be interpreted with caution, the April to June 2012 figures show a fall in seasonally adjusted journeys of 2 per cent for England compared with the previous quarter, with falls in London, metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.

## Background information

  * Quarterly estimates are based on a panel of the 18 largest non-metropolitan operators, Passenger Transport Executives (for metropolitan areas) and Transport for London (TfL). The panel covers over 90 per cent of the journeys made in Great Britain. Data from the quarterly panel is scaled to annual figures from the Department's main annual survey of 700 PSV operators, and figures are then seasonally adjusted. More information is in the Guidance Notes (see link in Related Information below).
  * The quarterly figures are less precise than the annual statistics which aim to report on all journeys, including those covered by smaller operators.
  * Quarterly figures are subject to revision due to the nature of the seasonal adjustment, and scaling to annual figures. However, these will typically be minor and not affect overall patterns shown
  * **Publishing schedule:** Quarterly

## Door to door Journey Planner

![Image: door to door icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/doortodoor)

The core feature of the Transport Direct Portal is the Door-to-door journey planner. A world first, this plans journeys from door to door using all feasible means of public transport anywhere in Great Britain; at the same time it can plan the journey by car, allowing the user to compare car and public transport journey options (Figure 5).

**Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys**

![Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/fig5a.jpg)

![Figure 5: Comparing Public Transport and Car Journeys](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/fig5b.jpg)

Once the journeys have been planned:

  * The costs of the journey options can be provided as can the CO2 emissions;
  * Tickets can be purchased from online retailers (through an automated hand-off) or telephone numbers provided for telephone-based retailers;
  * The route, or individual sections of it, can be displayed on a map;
  * Calling points for a service can be displayed;
  * All information can be printed in order to provide an informative itinerary to take on the journey.

When **connecting people to places**, it is important that users can find their journey origin and destination from appropriate gazetteers or directly from the map. Transport Direct has created a rich set of gazetteers, based on postcodes, addresses, transport locations, places and even local attractions.

  * [Single mode Journey Planners](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/JourneyPlannerInput.aspx)

![Image: single mode journey planners icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/singlejourney)

In many cases, the traveller may only want to find out about part of a journey or travelling options using specific modes. Consequently, Transport Direct provides a range of modal journey planners:

  * Find a train;
  * Find a flight;
  * Find a car route;
  * Find a coach;
  * Find a bus;
  * Find a cycle route.

## Live travel information

![Image: live travel news icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/livetravelnews)

Underpinning Transport Direct is comprehensive provision of live travel information, sourced from authoritative sources and recognised intermediaries.

The live travel news is updated every 15 minutes and can be filtered by:

  * Region / all of Great Britain;
  * Public transport / road / all types of transport;
  * Major / recent / all delays;
  * Incidents / road & rail engineering works / all types of travel news;
  * All road or public transport incidents can also be displayed on a map for geographic referencing.

Transport Direct also provides links to up-to-the-minute arrival and departure information for rail, bus services (where provided) and flights from the definitive sources such as National Rail, Transport for London, bus service information providers and airport operators.

## Car Parking and Park-and-Ride information

![Image: park and ride icon](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/carparking)

  * [**Car Parking and Park-and-Ride information on Transport Direct**](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/LiveTravel/DepartureBoards.aspx?NotFindAMode=true)

Planning a car journey from door to door is straightforward when there is readily available on-road or off-road car parking. However, this is not always the case. Much more useful would be to plan to the nearest car park (within walking distance of the destination) or to a park-and-ride service and complete the journey by public transport.

Transport Direct has car park information for over 10,000 car parks, covering major towns and cities across Great Britain, and the range is being constantly expanded.

Using the ""find nearest car park"" service, the user can now find the nearest car park to their destination and also get information on costs and opening times. Car Parks are also shown on Transport Direct's maps, enabling journeys to be planned to and from these locations.

Transport Direct also has park-and-ride information for many cities, with details on cost and opening hours. The ""plan to park and ride"" service plans car journeys to and from the best park-and-ride location for the direction of travel to that city.

## Calculating Carbon Emissions

![Image: carbon calculator screen shot](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110206082507/http://www.dft.gov.uk/144130/246087/carboncalculator)

  * [Calculating Carbon Emissions on Transport Direct](http://www.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/FindCarParkInput.aspx)

Transport Direct launched a car ""carbon calculator"" at the end of 2006, which is believed to be another world first. This feature enables the user to calculate the amount of CO2 emitted for a specific journey planned on Transport Direct, taking account of predicted levels of congestion on the roads and so enabling greater accuracy in the calculation of the emitted CO2.

In April 2007, Transport Direct launched an equivalent public transport carbon calculator. This enables users to find out how much CO2 is emitted from their specific public transport journey and compares this with car and other modes of transport.

It should be noted that comparing car CO2 with public transport CO2 is not comparing like for like, where the predicted CO2 emission for a:

  * Car journey is based on a specified number of occupants;
  * Public transport journey is based on an estimate of the number of passengers.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/high-speed-rail-addendum-2,High speed rail: Investing in Britain’s future consultation summary report addendum 2,A summary of seven hundred and twenty two (722) responses submitted online that were not fully analysed.,"## Summary

On 10 January 2012, the Government announced its decision to develop a new national high speed rail network following the completion of a major public consultation.

On 29 May, the consultation responses were published online. We have discovered, since then, that a small number of responses submitted online (722 of around 55,000 submitted in total) were not analysed fully by Dialogue by Design (DbyD) due to technical errors. For these responses, the answers to one or more of the seven consultation questions were omitted from DbyD's analysis. In total, approximately 0.4% of answers provided to individual consultation questions were affected.

This addendum report is a supplementary analysis by DbyD of the seven hundred and twenty two (722) affected consultation responses submitted online. The report concludes that the affected responses 'do not provide any information that was not already included in the previous Consultation Summary Report or would have made a difference to the substantive content or balance of that report'.

The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport issued a statement about this to Parliament on 18 September 2012 explaining that the cause has been identified as technical errors in transferring data captured from online consultation responses to the consultation analysis database held by DbyD.

All those who submitted the responses affected have been contacted with details of their particular cases to notify them and apologise.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-property-compensation-london-west-midlands,High Speed Two:  Property and Compensation for London - West Midlands video,Video giving information about the High Speed Two property and compensation for London - West Midlands residents.,"## Transcript

HS2 will be a national high-speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds with London and Heathrow. This video sets out the property and compensation proposals for the first stage of the network between London and the West Midlands.

HS2 will bring transformational benefits to the UK: major investment; new jobs; regeneration in cities; improved connectivity, faster journeys and freeing up capacity on existing rail lines, which are becoming increasingly congested.

But such a major project will also have environmental impacts and affect local property markets. The government has already worked hard to minimise the impact of HS2 on the landscape, protecting the countryside and local communities as far as possible by adding more tunnels and making changes to the proposed route between London and Birmingham.

Current law provides appropriate compensation for the vast majority of infrastructure projects.
HS2 will be an exceptional construction project - the biggest seen in the UK since Victorian times. Because of the exceptional nature of HS2 we believe it is right to go above and beyond what is set out in law.

So what is being proposed?

The six key elements of the government's proposals to help those affected by HS2 are as follows:

### Proposal 1: a streamlined advanced purchase

This simplifies the compensation process for property owners in HS2's safeguarded area; this is land that needs to be protected from any other conflicting developments.

### Proposal 2: a voluntary purchase scheme

This is for rural areas where the line is not in deep bored tunnels. Property owners within 120 metres of either side of the line, but outside the safeguarded area, could ask the government to buy their property for its unblighted market value, that is what it would have been worth if there had been no plans for HS2.

### Proposal 3: a sale and rent-back scheme

This would give greater flexibility for the homeowners whose properties need to be demolished. They could sell their properties to the Government, but remain living in them as tenants until the properties are required.

### Proposal 4: a long term hardship scheme

This would provide cover for properties beyond the voluntary purchase zone. It would help those who have a strong personal need to move but, because of HS2, cannot sell their home other than at a significant loss.

### Proposal 5: properties above tunnels

To provide confidence in properties above tunnels the Government will offer before and after surveys and settlement deeds and guarantee forever the rectification costs of any settlement or subsidence issues caused to properties by tunnelling.

### Proposal 6: Social rented housing

The government will work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to develop a strategy to replace any social rented housing lost as a result of HS2.

The Government's proposals are designed to ensure that property owners and occupiers receive as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.

The government would like your views on these proposals. For more information please visit [http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/).

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/intelligent-links,Transport Direct itelligent links,Information about Transport Direct's intelligent links.,"You can use intelligent links on your website to give directions to any number of destinations of your choosing. Intelligent links open Transport Direct's journey planning input page with your destination pre-set, like this: [Get directions](http://www.transportdirect.info/transportdirect/en/journeyplanning/jplandingpage.aspx?&id=bgsite&d=402136,286474&dn=Little%20Nibble%20Cafe)

  * [Lower Red Lion, St Albans (click Transport Direct logo in 'How to get there' section)](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub3577.html)

Creating an intelligent link is easy. If you have several destinations and want to create a link for each one, download this [Excel link generator](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/intelligent-links/intelligentlink.xls), which automates the process.

For just one link, use the following template link and follow the two steps described below: http://www.transportdirect.info/web2/journeyplanning/jpLandingPage.aspx?&id=bg2012&d= 526594,179632&dn=Royal+Albert+Hall

  * Change 526594,179632 to the X,Y co-ordinates of your destination (you can convert a postcode into co-ordinates with websites such as [Streetmap](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/))
  * Change Royal+Albert+Hall to the name of your destination. You can also change the text ""Get directions"" to anything you like, if you wish.

In HTML, the link would look something like this:

<a href=""http://www.transportdirect.info/web2/journeyplanning/jpLandingPage.aspx?&id=bg2012&d=526594,179632&dn=Royal+Albert+Hall"" target=_blank&rt;Get directions</a> (The target=_blank command will make Transport Direct open in a new browser window, so that your visitor doesn't 'lose' the page they were looking at).

The [Transport Direct Portal](http://www.transportdirect.info) provides a one-stop-shop for users to make intelligent travel choices based on its rich set of travel and transport information and services. Part of connecting people to places (Transport Direct's strapline) is to provide information on those places. This gives context to the journey by providing, for example, a map showing the location of a bus stop or a list of the nearest car parks to the destination. Location information and travel news both help the user to make intelligent travel choices and, as such, make better use of the transport infrastructure.

Transport Direct achieves an average of:

  * 378,000 user sessions per week
  * 2,000,000 pages per week
  * 12,500 mobile pages per week
  * 5,300 mobile user sessions per week
  * 10,100 Digital TV Web pages per week
  * 830 Digital TV User sessions per week

A set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were set out in Transport Direct's original business plan in order to assess the effectiveness of Transport Direct, including:

  * Initial achievement of one million unique visitor sessions in the first year of operation to confirm visibility and usage. This was achieved in June 2005, six months after launch.
  * A goal of ten million unique visitor sessions by 2006 to establish Transport Direct as a major source of travel and transport information. This was achieved on 1st December 2006.

Shared use routes are designed to accommodate the movement of pedestrians and cyclists. Shared use schemes require careful consideration and this Local Transport Note provides advice on their planning, design and provision. It suggests a scheme development process to help in deciding if shared use is appropriate for any given situation and stresses the importance of high quality inclusive design that addresses the needs of all users. It places particular emphasis on involving users, residents, and other stakeholders in the design process.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/making-smarter-choices-work,Making smarter choices work,"Explaining what smart choice measures are, what they can achieve and how they can be used effectively to reduce the impacts of congestion.","Making smarter choices work' is a promotional guide to explain what Smart Choice measures are, what they can achieve and how they can be used effectively to reduce the impacts of congestion.

We call these measures 'smarter choices' and they are becoming an increasingly important area for the Department for Transport. Smarter choices include local programmes to encourage school, workplace and individualised travel planning; improving public transport information and marketing services; setting up web sites for car share schemes and supporting car clubs; and encouraging teleworking and teleconferencing.

This guide has been written for local authorities ? both members and officers ? and explains what we know about smarter choice measures, based on the latest research. It explains how local authorities can use them to improve traffic flows and make life more pleasant for local people. The research on which this document is based was carried out during 2003-04 and looked at the impact that these measures can have on traffic. The final report, 'Smarter Choices ? Changing the Way We Travel'was published in July this year in parallel with the Department's White Paper 'The Future of Transport'. It provides firm evidence of the impact of smarter choices on traffic, particularly where local authorities have promoted them vigorously.

The challenge now for local authorities is to recognise the potential benefits of smarter choice measures so that they make them an integral part of their transport strategies. Not only can they reduce congestion, but they give people genuine travel choices. They also contribute cost-effectively to other Government priorities, such as improving accessibility and social inclusion, encouraging regeneration, reducing pollution and carbon emissions and helping to increase levels of physical activity.

Smarter choices are techniques for influencing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable options such as encouraging school, workplace and individualised travel planning. They also seek to improve public transport and marketing services such as travel awareness campaigns, setting up websites for car share schemes, supporting car clubs and encouraging teleworking.

## Travel plans

A travel plan is a package of measures produced by schools or employers to encourage parents or staff to use alternatives to single-occupancy car-use. Such a plan for example, could include: car sharing schemes; a commitment to improve cycling facilities; a dedicated bus service or restricted car parking allocations. It might also promote flexible-working practices such as remote access and video conferencing.

Travel plans can offer real benefits not only to organisations, pupils and/or employees, but also the community that surrounds it. They may help relieve local parking or congestion problems or improve public transport connections across the area. They may also relieve stress by reducing delays, or providing the opportunity for staff to cut their travel commitments by working from home on occasion.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/msrs-scheme,Guide to Mode Shift Revenue Support (MSRS) scheme,This guide outlines the criteria and processes in place for applying for support from the Mode Shift Revenue Support (MSRS) scheme.,"## About this guide

This guide outlines the criteria and processes in place for applying for support from the Mode Shift Revenue Support scheme, also known as MSRS. Although information is correct at the time of publication, it is advisable that potential applicants contact the appropriate administrative body for the most up to date information before submitting a formal application for grant.

It should be noted that there is no automatic entitlement to grant support and any offer of grant which may be made remains entirely at the discretion of the appropriate administrative body.

## What is MSRS?

MSRS assists companies with the operating costs associated with running rail or inland water freight transport instead of road, where rail or inland waterway transport is more expensive. It is designed to facilitate and support modal shift, generating environmental and wider social benefits from reduced lorry journeys on Britain's roads. The scheme operates in two parts:

  * MSRS (Intermodal) for the purchase of intermodal container movements by rail; and
  * MSRS (Bulk and Waterways) for the purchase of other freight traffic movements by rail and all movements by inland waterway.

MSRS is a direct replacement for both the Rail Environmental benefit Procurement Scheme (REPS) and the Waterborne Freight Grant for inland waterways.

Further details on MSRS (Intermodal) can be found in section 2, MSRS (Bulk and Waterways) in section 3 and how to apply for both schemes in section 4.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/noise-exposure-contours,Noise exposure contours,Noise exposure reports and contours for London airports (Heathrow- Gatwick and Stansted) in 2009.,"## Summary

The Environmental Research and Consultancy Department (ERCD) of the Civil Aviation Authority estimates the noise exposures around the London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) on behalf of the Department for Transport. The magnitude and extent of the aircraft noise around these airports are depicted on maps by contours of constant aircraft noise index (Leq) values. The contours are generated by a computer model validated with noise measurements, which calculates the emissions and propagation of noise from arriving and departing air traffic.

## Detail

ERCD produce annual reports on noise exposure contours at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and previous copies of these - back to 1997- are available on this website. These are detailed reports and essential reading for those wishing to understand both how noise exposure contours are produced and how they should be interpreted.

The annual reports include small scale diagrams of noise exposure contours which provide an overall impression of their proximity to major towns.

For those wishing to see more detailed representation of noise exposure contours on the ground, ERCD also produces contours overlaid on larger scale Ordnance Survey paper maps ( 1:50,000 ) or, more recently, in AutoCad DXF format (previously supplied on CD-ROM), the latter primarily used by specialist users such as town planners, consultants etc. Both of these have traditionally been available for purchase from the Department as described in the annual reports.

## Change to presentation of 2005 contours onwards

Annual reports for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are available on the website as before.

With effect from 2005, additional representation of noise exposure contours on Ordnance Survey maps has been made available on this website in two formats.

## PDF

**For the non specialist user** in particular, a PDF version of each of the large scale Ordnance Survey maps is available for viewing and downloading. Please note, however, that these are large documents and may take some time to download.

## AutoCad DXF

**For the specialist user** requiring greater detail, AutoCad DXF files are available on the website for download. (These allow the user to plot the contours on any scale of map).

Please note that in order to gain the best reproduction of contours on a larger scale Ordnance Survey map, it is necessary to have software that is capable of reading DXF files.

Please also note that in view of the large size of the files, they have been compressed using WinZip and will need to be 'unzipped' after being downloaded.

## Printed Maps

Contours overlaid on large scale Ordnance Survey paper maps (1:50,000) continue to be available, at a charge, as described in the annual reports. Although the information/scale presented is exactly same as in the PDF version (see above), the printed maps are larger.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/plug-in-car-grant,Plug-in Car Grant,Grant funding to support private and business buyers looking to purchase a qualifying ultra-low emission vehicle.,"Since January 2011, motorists purchasing a qualifying ultra-low emission car have been able to receive a grant of 25 per cent towards the cost of the vehicle, up to a maximum of £5,000. The 2010 Spending Review confirmed that Government has made provision to support the Plug-in Car Grant for the life of this Parliament. Both private consumers and businesses can benefit from the Plug-in Car Grant when purchasing a qualifying ultra-low emission car and registering it in the UK. The grant is only available on first registrations, with registration defined as falling under the [Vehicle Excise and Registration Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/all?title=vehicle%20excise%20and%20registration%20act) 1994. In addition, the grant can only be administered for a specific vehicle once.

The Government is adopting a technology neutral approach to reducing emissions from transport. This means that all cars that meet the criteria set out below are potentially eligible for the Grant. This includes, but is not limited to, electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-fuelled cars. However, consumers will find that hydrogen vehicles are, as yet, less available on the open market than electric and plug-in hybrid options.

The Plug-in Car Grant has been designed to help make the whole-life costs of a qualifying car more comparable with petrol or diesel equivalents. Over time, as manufacturers begin to make these cars in greater volumes, the costs of production should begin to fall. This will help to make an ultra-low carbon car a realistic option for anyone looking to buy a car.

The Grant is not designed to support research and development projects: any funding for this would be delivered by the Technology Strategy Board.

The cars eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant are:

As of 30 September 2012, 2,311 claims have been made through the Plug-in Car Grant scheme.

## 1. Car eligibility

To be eligible for the Grant, applicants need to demonstrate that their completed vehicle (chassis and bodywork) has type approval or Individual Vehicle Approval and meets the Grant criteria. These criteria have been set to ensure that vehicles meet an agreed level of performance and safety.

## 2. Multi-stage builds

To qualify for the Plug-In Car Grant any multi-stage built M1 vehicle will need to have been approved as a completed vehicle (e.g. comprising both chassis and bodywork): the accepted evidence listed above must cover the vehicle in its finished condition. An approval for a vehicle that has not been completed will not be accepted. This is to ensure vehicles driven off the forecourt when bought by the public meet the Plug-In Car Grant criteria.

Manufacturers will need to consult the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) to obtain completed vehicle approval

## 4. Frequently asked questions

i. I am thinking about buying a qualifying car - how do I apply for the Grant?
If you are looking to use the Plug-in Car Grant to purchase an eligible car, the good news is that there are no application forms to fill in. The dealership or vendor you are buying your car from will complete all the paperwork on your behalf as you buy the car; and the amount of your Grant will be automatically deducted from the price of your car at the point of purchase.

Before you purchase your car, the dealer will ask you a few questions about your decision to purchase an ultra-low emission vehicle. This data will help inform policy decisions about ultra-low emission cars and supporting infrastructure.

ii. How do I know which vehicles are eligible for the Grant?
The list above shows which vehicles are eligible and this will be updated when more cars enter the scheme. These vehicles meet all the criteria.

iii. I am a vehicle manufacturer looking to see whether a model is eligible for subsidy under the terms of the scheme. How do I apply for Plug-in Car Grant eligibility?
Vehicle manufacturers who want to apply for their vehicle model to be eligible for subsidy under the scheme will need to make a formal application. To do this, you will require an application pack and associated guidance. You can request this from [olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk). The guidance document will give you more detail about how to provide evidence that you meet each criterion, including examples of acceptable evidence.

iv. I am a vehicle importer looking to import and sell eligible vehicles in the UK. How do I apply for Plug-in Car Grant eligibility?
Importers also need to demonstrate the vehicles they will import and sell meet the Grant criteria. To do this, you will require an application pack and associated guidance. You can request this from [olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:olev.enquiries@olev.gsi.gov.uk). For example, you will need to submit information on the measures you have taken to mitigate electrical safety risks and the warranty that you will provide with the vehicles that you intend to sell.

v. What about vehicles that have been converted?
The Grant is for new cars and vans at first registration in the UK. Pre-registration conversions are eligible to be submitted for the scheme however, post-registration conversions are not.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/rail-industry-research-strategy-implementation-plan,Rail industry research strategy implementation plan,This implementation plan sets out each of the actions that have cascaded from the 2007 rail industry research strategy (RIRS).,"## Executive summary

The Rail Industry Research Strategy (RIRS) was published in December 2007. It established a set of strategic priorities for rail research aimed at supporting the delivery of the rail industry's long-term vision for the railway as expressed in the Rail Technical Strategy and Rail White Paper. The RIRS also considered how rail-related research is managed, delivered and funded. A set of 'Enabling Actions' was proposed for development to support the implementation of the strategy.

This Implementation Plan sets out each of these Enabling Actions, focusing on short-term activities and plans for 2008/09. The Enabling Actions tackle three main areas:

  * Strategic research - to encourage a step-change in the delivery of strategic research, focused on meeting the long-term challenges of the railway as set out in the Rail Technical Strategy. This is a priority of the RIRS. The relevant Enabling Actions are:
    * Establishing a client group for strategic research
    * Developing a framework for strategic research
    * A new strategic research programme
    * Developing route maps to the railway of the future
  * Collaboration - to ensure that best use is made of existing funding by leveraging in additional resources from the private sector, from Europe and from other non-rail public sector sources. The Enabling Actions comprise:
    * Developing an additional co-funding mechanism for RSSB research to encourage partnership with the private sector
    * Collaborative working with Research Councils and other research funders
    * Engaging effectively in European research
  * Delivery mechanisms - to identify, promote and adopt best practice in the delivery of research. The Enabling Actions are:
    * Improving the transition from research to technology development
    * Knowledge management to capture and make use of the results of research
    * Technology transfer from other industries or other countries
    * Estimating benefits at proposal stage
    * Evaluating the impacts of completed rail research

Each of these Enabling Actions has an identified owner, agreed long-term aims and short-term objectives.

Finally, the Implementation Plan also sets out how resource requirements for rail research can be evaluated. In the short-term, priority actions are aimed at achieving better value for money from the resources currently available and providing incremental increases where this can be justified. In the medium term, an approach which seeks to establish the level of research funding needed in its totality is more appropriate. These initiatives will be progressed in parallel with the 12 Enabling Actions.

## Background information

Rail passenger kilometres totals are published quarterly by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). The rail industry's central ticketing system, LENNON, is the basis for passenger kilometres data. LENNON holds information on the vast majority of national rail tickets purchased in Great Britain and is used to allocate the revenue from ticket sales between train operating companies.

ORR also receives quarterly non-LENNON kilometres data from train operators. Non-LENNON data are information not recorded within the LENNON system such as operator specific tickets and Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) multi-modal tickets.

The statistics are converted from kilometres to miles by DfT for the purposes of this publication.

The data supplied in the table and the charts refer to financial rather than calendar years.

  * **Publishing schedule:** Quarterly
  * **Last updated:** 13 September 2012

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/security-of-dangerous-goods-by-road-and-rail,Security requirements for moving dangerous goods by road and rail,Requirements and guidance for businesses involved in the carriage of dangerous goods.,"## Introduction

Businesses involved in the carriage of dangerous goods by road and rail for national and international journeys are required to take security measures to safeguard against acts of terrorism in accordance with chapter 1.10 of the [European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/adr_e.html) and of the [Appendix C of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail](http://www.otif.org/en/publications/rid-2011.html), Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (RID).

## The requirements

Regulation 5 of the [Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1348/contents/made) (and as amended) apply the security provisions of ADR and RID for national journeys. Regulations 7 and 8 also contain additional security requirements for Great Britain. These Regulations are subject to agreed derogations as set out in the [Carriage of Dangerous Goods: Approved Derogations and Transitional Provisions](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/cdg-approved-derogations-and-transitional-provisions/).

The security requirements are split between two levels. A general level is applicable to all dangerous goods and requires that they shall only be offered to people, companies or organisations that have been appropriately identified, temporary storage sites shall be properly secured, drivers shall carry a means of photographic identification and security training awareness shall be provided. A higher level applies for high consequence dangerous goods and requires that a security plan is adopted, implemented and complied with. High consequence dangerous goods are defined as those which have the potential for misuse in a terrorist incident and which may, as a result, produce serious consequences such as mass casualties or mass destruction.

The requirements do not apply to the carriage of civil nuclear material as defined by the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (NISR). The transport of such material and non nuclear radioactive material is regulated by the [Office for Nuclear Regulation](http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/transport/index.htm) in accordance with NISR.

### Road and rail guidance documents

The Department for Transport (DfT) published guidance when the security requirements originally came into force in July 2005 to help you determine which measures you should apply in order to comply with the security requirements. This guidance is currently being reviewed and updated and will appear here in the near future. If in the mean time you have any enquiries regarding the security requirements please contact the Department using the contact details below.

A summary of the research that DfT has undertaken from past to present on the modelling and appraisal of travel time variability (reliability). This is mostly for highway modelling, but has some elements of rail reliability also. This provides clarity on the position we're at regarding research. This is a complex area for appraisal, particularly given the importance of reliability, that we need to better understand in order to potentially integrate into our modelling tools and appraisal system.

The Traffic Commissioners (""TCs"") are appointed by the Secretary of State. They are statutorily independent and their main function is to administer the goods and public service vehicle operator licensing systems. There is a statutory requirement for each TC to submit an annual report to the Secretary of State on their activities during the year. Although the Government is under no legal obligation to publish them, in the interest of transparency it has always done so, alongside an overview by the Senior Traffic Commissioner and detailed statistical information (on number of applications processed etc).

The Trans European Network - Transport (TEN-T) Programme exists to support the development of the single market by providing funding for transport infrastructure projects on a set of defined networks. The network covers all modes:

  * major road (motorways and some trunk roads) and rail routes
  * significant airports
  * ports
  * inter-modal terminals
  * traffic management systems covering the air, road, rail and inland waterways

The [TEN-T Guidelines](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/ten-t-policy/legal-basis/guidelines_en.htm) contain the maps which define the network. The policy for the programme is set by the European Commission's [Directorate General for Mobility and Transport](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/index_en.htm) (DG MOVE). The Programme is managed by the [Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency](http://tentea.ec.europa.eu/) (TEN-T EA).

## Financial support from the TEN-T programme

Financial support from the TEN-T programme is available to both studies and works-based projects. It acts as a stimulus for infrastructure projects, it is not a subsidy.
The current budget runs from 2007 to 2013 and amounts to €8 billion. Funding is allocated through two mechanisms:

  * Multi-Annual Work Programme for complex priority projects that may require regular support (80% of the total budget)
  * Annual Work Programme for one off projects (20% of the total budget)

Nearly €7 billion of the budget was committed to priority projects through the Multi-Annual Work Programme at the start of the programme in 2007.

## Applying for TEN-T support

Calls for funding under the different mechanisms are usually done on an annual basis with each call having a particular set of criteria that projects must meet in order to be eligible for funding. Information on calls for funding can be found on the [TEN-T EA web site](http://tentea.ec.europa.eu/en/apply_for_funding/follow_the_funding_process/calls_for_proposals_2010.htm). Projects are subject to external evaluation to ensure that they meet the criteria for the call and are scored in several areas (including maturity, relevance to TEN-T objectives, impact of the project on the network and the environment and the quality of the project).

The Department for Transport's Trans-European Network team coordinate the bidding process for UK applications. All proposed bids for support must be in line with UK transport policy and have policy clearance from the relevant DfT modal policy division or Devolved Administration.

In order be considered for funding applicants must be able to demonstrate that their project is:

  * Mature and well developed with costs and timetables established and management and planning in place;
  * Adds value to the development of the European TEN-T network.

The level of funding is variable depending on the type of projects. Studies can receive up to 50% of eligible costs, cross border projects 30%, priority projects 20% and projects that are not on the priority network can get up to 10%.

## Successful Awards

Since the creation of the programme in 1996 the department has helped a large number of projects to obtain funding.

## TEN-T Policy Review

The European Commission has initiated a review of the TEN-T policy. The TEN-T Green Paper, launched in February 2009, was the first stage in this process. The Commission published their draft for a [new TEN-T Regulation](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/revision-t_en.htm) in October 2011 to be taken forward under the Co-decision process by the European Council and European Parliament (EP). The Council agreed a General Approach on the draft Regulation at the March 2012 Transport Council. The EP is scheduled to vote on the draft Regulation at their Plenary in January 2013.
A new finance Regulation for TEN-T, the [Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/connecting_en.htm), was also published by the European Commission in October 2011. This will also be taken through the Co-decision process. This will cover all the TENs workstreams - Transport, Energy and Telecoms. A Partial General Approach (PGA) was agreed at the June 2012 Transport Council and the EP is scheduled to vote on this draft Regulation at their Plenary in January 2013.",guidance,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-sure-uk-airports-and-airlines-are-safe-secure-and-competitive-while-reducing-their-impacts-on-the-environment-and-communities,,department-for-transport,18-Oct-2012,2012-10-18,,,,220,"[{""link"": ""http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/ten-t-programme/ten-t-awards.pdf"", ""title"": ""Full list of awards (PDF \u2013 103 KB)""}]",4623
new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-cyclist,THINK! cyclist,THINK! cyclist is a new campaign to help reduce the number of pedal cyclists killed and seriously injured on the roads.,"THINK! cyclist is a new communications campaign to help reduce the number of pedal cyclists who are killed and seriously injured on the roads by informing cyclists and motorists of the steps they can take to avoid collisions.

[DfT's road casualty statistics](http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/reported-road-casualties-gb-main-results-2011) show that in 2011:

  * The number of pedal cyclists killed fell by 4 per cent from 111 in 2010 to 107 in 2011.
  * The total number of casualties reported to the police as seriously injured in a road accident increased by 16 per cent to 3,085. Total reported casualties among pedal cyclists also rose, by 12 per cent, compared to 2010. Pedal cyclist traffic levels are estimated to have risen by 2.2 per cent over the same period.
  * 92 per cent of reported cyclists killed or seriously injured (KSI) occurred in accidents involving another vehicle (usually a car).
  * The most common contributory factor to accidents involving cyclists and drivers recorded by police officers at the accident scene is that one or both participants 'looked but failed to see'.

The strategic focus for the THINK! cyclist campaign is to encourage drivers and cyclists to look out for each other by giving road safety advice. The campaign has two main premises:

  * Cyclists and drivers share many similarities, including the fact that large numbers fall into both groups with 80 per cent of cyclists holding a driving licence and 20 per cent of drivers cycling at least once a month.
  * Visibility is essential to good road safety.

## Campaign messages

The overall campaign message is 'Let's look out for each other'.

The supporting messages of the campaign are:

When you're driving

  1. Look out for cyclists, especially when turning - make eye contact if possible so they know you've seen them
  2. Use your indicators - signal your intentions so that cyclists can react
  3. Give cyclists space - at least half a car's width. If there isn't sufficient space to pass, hold back. Remember that cyclists may need to manoeuvre suddenly if the road is poor, it's windy or if a car door is opened
  4. Always check for cyclists when you open your car door
  5. Avoid driving over advanced stop lines - these allow cyclists to get to the front and increase their visibility
  6. Follow the Highway Code including 'stop' and 'give way' signs and traffic lights

When you're cycling

  1. Ride positively, decisively and well clear of the kerb - look and signal to show drivers what you plan to do and make eye contact where possible so you know drivers have seen you
  2. Avoid riding up the inside of large vehicles, like lorries or buses, where you might not be seen
  3. Always use lights after dark or when visibility is poor
  4. Wearing light coloured or reflective clothing during the day and reflective clothing and/or accessories in the dark increases your visibility
  5. Follow the Highway Code including observing 'stop' and 'give way' signs and traffic lights
  6. THINK! recommends wearing a correctly fitted cycle helmet, which is securely fastened and conforms to current regulations

## Campaign activity

This first THINK! cyclist activity is a month-long PR campaign to communicate cycling safety advice to drivers and cyclists through coverage in local, national and online media.

The campaign seeks to attract media coverage from national and regional news media as a means to promote awareness of the campaign messages.

The campaign is the first stage in building long term relationships between THINK! cyclist and organisations including those involved with motoring, cycling and local safety. The objective is to work in partnership to deliver cycling safety messages to drivers and cyclists, through trusted organisations.

A 'stakeholder toolkit' is available for stakeholders to download. This includes key messages and creative assets to encourage organisations to use THINK! cyclist messages in their own cycle safety campaigns.

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/traffic-signals-low-demand-periods,Operation of traffic signals during low demand periods,Options for signalling in periods of low demand.,"## Summary

Traffic signal design is a science that has been developed through decades to a point where the maximum efficiency can be squeezed out of the most congested of junctions. Conflicting needs of all road users are measured, evaluated and optimised such that the ever-increasing and varying demands continue to be managed with ingenuity and perfection.

But roads aren't always busy. In many cases the very justification for signal control is based on a problem that may only exist for a couple of hours each weekday. Even the most congested networks have their quiet moment, yet, in a deserted city at 3 in the morning, signals still cycle for non-existent traffic. Any driver who ventures into this scenario may sit in frustration at a red light while the 'intelligent' control system optimises the signals for phantom conflicting demands.

In other countries various techniques are applied to 'demote' signalised junctions to priority mode of operation, for example the flashing amber on main road/flashing red on minor road employed in some States of the USA, or signals that simply turn off overnight as in parts of Europe.

The Department for Transport commissioned a desktop study to investigate options for signal controlled installations that could

  * reduce unnecessary delays to traffic, hence minimising overall vehicle delays and emissions;
  * reduce the energy consumption of signal installations; and
  * maintain or enhance levels of safety, especially for vulnerable road users.

The study reviewed current practice in the UK and overseas, developed an assessment technique to identify the types of installation that may be suitable for an alternative low-demand strategy during periods of low demand and in liaison with 12 Local Authorities devised 25 potential control strategy options to meet the objectives. These options were then modelled on a small hypothetical VISSIM network, enabling assessment on factors relating to economy, environment, safety, legislation and design, and classified according to their potential for implementation - short, medium or long term - depending upon factors such as required changes to legislation, technology or driver comprehension.

The findings were notable - the options offering most benefit during low demand periods were also the most difficult to implement. However there are opportunities for embracing developing technologies and making minor changes to installation parameters that could reduce installation and maintenance costs and improve the efficiency of LD methods of operation that retain signal control and its intrinsic safety compared with priority operation. The outcome of the research commissioned by the Department for Transport on options for signalling in periods of low demand are presented in this report.

For Transport Direct white labelling is about providing our services through a third party. Transport Direct is working with organisations to bring easily accessible and reliable transport information directly to people using the internet for a wide variety of reasons.

Transport Direct's ""White Label"" schemes allow external organisations to present Transport Direct's door-to door planner on their own website, in their own corporate branding. This results in a value-added and seamless 'customer journey' for external organisation whilst enabling Transport Direct to reach people who may not have been aware of the benefits of planning their travel with Transport Direct. White labelling sites include the BBC, Visit Britain and Directgov.

There are some restrictions for some third parties who require White labelling due to the data agreements that we have in place.

We can also offer third parties a cycle planner white label.

## Web services

Transport Direct offers the back office services that are called and used by you. We expose some web services through APIs and send you back XML data for you to display on your own user interface.

The advantage of this is that the user interface and branding is entirely yours. You determine the look and feel of how the information is presented and you can fit in the travel information with the rest of your business processes ensuring the user remains on your site.

For such infrastructure you may need to create a new user interface for the presentation of this information and there maybe a requirement to pay on an ongoing basis per transaction depending on usage.

This solution may be particularly useful to non PC based channels such as the travel content for mobile devices or for interactive TV.

## Joining up Government services - Project Lauren

From August 2006 the Department for Work and Pensions has utilised the Transport Direct back-office processing to generate a tailored journey plan that accompanies the appointment letters for the medical assessments for Incapacity Benefit arranged each year. About 1 million of these letters together with a personalised journey plan are sent out annually. These show how the recipient can travel from their home to the assessment centre. It is expected that this will help to reduce the 20% 'no show' rate for these assessments.

## Transcript

I'm sorry I can't be with you today, but I would like to thank the Trees and Design Action Group for giving me this opportunity to talk to you about the importance of trees in the urban environment.

Two important documents are being launched today - Trees in the Townscape, and a report on the findings from the UK i-Tree Eco pilot project. This event also marks the launch of Neighbourhoods Green's Tree Management Toolkit - a web-based source of advice which promotes well managed green space in housing estates.

We tend to take trees for granted and that's maybe why we need organisations such as the Trees and Design Action Group. We need to be reminded on how tree planting can enhance urban environments and that the protection of existing trees is just as important. It's worth noting that the advantages of trees are in proportion to their size - large mature trees bring more benefits than smaller ones do.

The Department for Transport has long recognised the value of trees and other planting in urban environments. In 2007, the Manual for Streets was published, this focused on the design of residential streets. In 2010, the Chartered Institution of Highways & Transportation published a key piece of complementary guidance - Manual for Streets 2 - Wider Application of the Principles. It extended the original Manual for Streets principles to fill the gap between residential streets and trunk roads.

Both documents represented a radical change in approach to street design, and both recognise the value that trees impart to our daily lives. They emphasise that trees bring a wide range of benefits to individuals and to society as a whole.

First and foremost, trees contribute to character and distinctiveness, they create visual interest, more importantly perhaps, they help improve the air quality, and they help to soften the street scene. In essence, they are an excellent place-making tool in urban design.

But, their potential contribution goes beyond that. Trees provide habitats for wildlife and they have a role to play in climate change. They can provide shade and reduce the local environmental temperature. They can also slow down the rate at which rainfall enters the drainage system. The recent floods have highlighted the importance of good surface water management, and trees can play their part here.

As a driver, I am in no doubt that a lovely avenue of trees makes a journey more pleasant, whether in a town setting or in the countryside. The French certainly understand this. I recommend the old main road from Dieppe to Paris, still with its lines of trees but delightfully much freer of traffic. And I am proud that, before I was a minister, I stopped the Highways Agency from cutting down a wonderful run of mature trees along the central reservation of the A27 in my constituency of Lewes. They were concerned that they could be dangerous for any motorist veering off the carriageway. I am happy to say they agreed to my suggestion for crash barriers instead, and so the trees continue to give pleasure to thousands of motorists day in, day out.

On top of all this, trees make financial sense. The economic, environmental and social benefits arising from street trees vastly outweigh the cost of providing and maintaining them. The i-Tree report being launched today is testimony to this.

But how can we turn all of this into reality?

The target audience for Trees in the Townscape is decision makers, especially local councillors who are setting out policy. So a good starting point is to take heed of the 12 key principles that ""Trees in the Townscape"" puts forward. They form a sound basis for any local authority policy on street trees.

Putting these principles into action does rely on a considerable amount of collaborative working between various disciplines and interested parties, in much the same way as Manual for Streets 1 and 2 strongly advocate.

Hopefully, designers will already be familiar with what the Manuals say about trees, but it doesn't hurt to remind them that planting should be integrated into street designs wherever possible. And they should remember that the early involvement of stakeholders often pays dividends - for example, relatively minor scheme adjustments such as slightly realigning a carriageway to avoid a mature tree, could cause all sorts of problems if that same adjustment comes as an afterthought late in the design process.

But collaboration needs to take place at all levels. In March, I launched the opening of the Greater Bristol Bus Network scheme. With support from the Government, Bristol City Council worked with Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Councils to create a reliable bus network for the 52 million bus journeys made in the Greater Bristol area each year. The results are impressive but I particularly appreciated the attention given to street trees. £1.2 million was earmarked for additional landscaping and this resulted in the planting of 500 new trees along 10 key bus routes in the city.

As I mentioned earlier, the Department for Transport has long recognised the value of trees and other planting in urban environments. When you look at the myriad benefits street trees bring about, it becomes obvious that the advantages cut across the interests of many different parts of Government. My hope is that close inter-departmental cooperation on this issue in the future means that we will see more trees in our towns and cities.

Thank you for listening and please accept my wishes for a successful launch event for these three important sources of advice.

Thank you.",guidance,improving-local-transport,,background-to-transport-direct,department-for-transport,27-Jun-2012,2012-06-27,,,,92,[],6301

new,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/unadopted-roads,Unadopted (private) roads,Draft planning conditions to help prepare roads for adoption by local highway authorities.,"## Summary

'Unadopted' roads are those roads not maintained by a highway authority as defined by Highways Act 1980. The description of such roads covers a wide range of circumstances.

For most unadopted residential roads the duty to maintain it falls to the frontagers, ie the owners of the property fronting that road, which may include those where the side, or length, of their property fronts the unadopted road. Those buying property on an unadopted street should be made aware of the situation regarding their property and their related liability for the road. Under Highways Act 1980, local highway authorities may adopt streets that they are not currently responsible for maintaining, but this is purely a matter for local decision.

In respect of roads on planned new residential developments a Working Group of representatives from central and local government has developed this set of draft planning conditions. These draft conditions have been created to assist in preparing such roads for adoption by local highway authorities with the aim of protecting the interests of new residents. Local highway and planning authorities may wish to consider where / if the use of these draft planning conditions are appropriate. Where the conditions are used, feedback about authorities' experiences of working with them would be welcome. A response form has be included within Addendum A at the end of the draft document.

modified,http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/carbon-calculator,Carbon calculator,Biofuels carbon calculator.,"> The carbon calculator is a standalone programme that contains default values for the carbon emissions associated with various types of biofuels. It allows fuel suppliers to calculate the carbon saved on a batch of fuels, as an alternative to looking up values in the C&S guidance tables. It should reduce the potential for errors.

> The calculator uses the RTFO lifecycle analysis methodology for Years 1 and 2 (2008/09 and 2009/10). From Year 3 (2010/11) the lifecycle analysis methodology laid out in the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is applied. The latest version aligns the LCA methodology further with that of the RED (from 15 Dec 2011 or Year 4.5 in the tool).
>
> ## Carbon calculator features
>
>   * Calculate the carbon intensity of your biofuel on a consignment basis as required by the administrator.
>   * Includes all the biofuels, feedstocks and biofuel production processes listed in RED Annex V and includes every default and input value within the calculations.
>   * Includes emissions from cultivation by NUTS2 region and biofuel feedstock.
>   * Generate monthly reports as a CSV file that can be uploaded to ROS to comply with C&S reporting requirements.
>   * Load a project file from, for example, a biofuel producer into the system and retain any information they provide such as data references, batch numbers etc.
>   * Can be run ""offline"" so that all of the users consignments will be stored on their own PC. Not all information (e.g. nitrogen inputs) has to be passed on to the next supplier in the supply chain (but can be if needed).
