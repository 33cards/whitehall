Key points

  * The overall rate of non-compliant vehicles in Great Britain traffic was estimated to be 2.9 per cent in 2008. This is a fall from the 2007 figure of 3.1 per cent.
  * Of the different vehicle tax classes, non-compliance rates in Great Britain traffic were estimated to be highest amongst motorcycles (8.5 per cent in 2007 and 4.7 per cent in 2008).
  * The overall rate of non-compliant vehicles in stock in Great Britain was estimated to be 2.8 per cent in 2008, equivalent to approximately 677,000 vehicles. This represents a drop from the estimated 3.2 per cent in 2007, which is equivalent to approximately 857 thousand vehicles.
  * The overall rate of vehicles in Great Britain traffic which were both licensed and MOT compliant was 96.1 per cent in 2007. This increased to 96.7 per cent in 2008.

## The main results from the seatbelt survey for England are:

  * The proportion of car drivers observed wearing seat belts has not changed since the 2008 survey, remaining at 95 per cent in 2009.
  * The proportion of car front seat passengers observed wearing seat belts or child restraints has decreased slightly from 96 per cent in 2008 to 95 per cent in 2009.
  * The proportion of car rear seat passengers observed wearing seat belts or child restraints has risen to 89 per cent in 2009 from 88 per cent in 2008.

## The main results from the mobile phone use survey are:

  * Since the last survey in September 2008 the proportion of drivers observed using hand-held mobile phones whilst driving increased (from 1.1 per cent to 1.4 per cent for car drivers and from 2.2 per cent to 2.6 per cent for van and lorry drivers). 
  * An increase in the number of drivers who appear to be using hands free mobile phones (from 0.5 per cent to 1.4 per cent for car drivers and from 1.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent for van and lorry drivers) was observed in the same period.

## Technical information

  * The Department for Transport has commissioned regular surveys of seatbelt wearing in England since 1988. Surveys take place at 32 sites in two areas centred on Nottingham and Crowthorne. They are undertaken during daylight hours, and involve survey staff located at light controlled junctions making observations about seatbelt and child restraint use by vehicle occupants. In 2009, an additional survey was conducted at 21 sites in Scotland, using the same methodology.
  * Surveys to monitor mobile phone use by drivers have been carried out since 2002. Each year the survey is carried out at 30 sites in the South East of England. Surveys take place throughout daylight hours and involve observers recording mobile phone use by drivers in free-flowing traffic, aided by a mobile phone detector.
  * For both surveys, sites are chosen to cover a selection of road types, speed limits and rural/urban locations, and results are weighted to represent the traffic distribution at national level. These surveys are based on selected areas of the country and therefore the results will not necessarily be nationally representative. However, the survey sites used are consistent over time.

This publication presents statistics on personal travel in Great Britain during 2010. It contains the latest results and trends on how, why, when and where people travel as well as factors which affect personal travel such as car availability, driving licence holding and access to key services.

## Update

On 6 October 2011 a set of tables showing NTS results by region, country and area type were published. These tables all have the table name format of nts99xx.

It is necessary to combine survey year data together when producing NTS results for geographic areas below that of Great Britain due to small sample sizes.

## Key points

  * There has been a steady falling trend in trip rates since 1995/97. Average distance travelled per person per year remained relatively stable until 2007, but has declined slightly over the last three years.
  * In 2010, there was an average of 960 trips per person per year - the lowest level since the mid-1970s. There were 1,061 stages, 6,726 miles travelled, and an average trip length of 7.0 miles. 
  * Between 1995/97 and 2010, overall trips rates fell by 12%. Trips by private modes of transport fell by 14% while public transport modes increased by 8%. Walking trips saw the largest decrease.
  * Most of the decline in overall trips rates between 1995/97 and 2010 can be accounted for by a fall in shopping and visiting friends.
  * In 2010, 80% of males and 66% of females held a full car driving licence. While the proportion of males holding a licence remained fairly stable since the early 1990's, the proportion of females with a licence continued to increase.
  * Trips by car (as a driver or passenger) accounted for 64% of all trips made and 78% of distance travelled in 2010. 
  * On average, females make more trips than males, but males travel much further each year.
  * Concessionary travel pass take-up in 2010 was 78% of those eligible.
  * Average annual car mileage was estimated to be 8,430 miles in 2010.

## Key points

  * 4.3 billion litres of biofuel have been supplied under the RTFO in the first 36 months.

**In the twelve months of the 2010/11 obligation period:**

  * 1,440 million litres of biofuel have been supplied, which is approximately 3.1% of total road transport fuel. The annual target is 3.5%.
  * More biodiesel (59%) has been supplied than bioethanol (41%). A small volume of biogas has also been declared to the administrator.
  * The largest single feedstock for biofuel was used cooking oil (428m litres, 30% of total biofuel supplied). The most widely reported source of biodiesel was soy from Argentina (180m litres, 21% of biodiesel supplied). The most widely reported source of bioethanol was sugarcane from Brazil (119m litres, 20% of bioethanol supplied).
  * The majority of feedstock has been imported; 22% of the biofuel was reported as coming from UK feedstocks.
  * Greenhouse gas savings of 58% were achieved against a target of 50%.
  * 55% of biofuels were produced according to the criteria of a recognised environmental standard, against a target of 80%. For fuels coming from UK feedstocks this figure was 85%.
  * The feedstock is known for 97% of fuel supplied. Both the feedstock and country of origin are known for 97%.

## Key points

  * Between 2009 and 2010, the amount of goods moved by GB-registered vehicles in the UK increased by 11 per cent to 139 billion tonne kilometres.
  * Over the same period, the amount of goods lifted increased by 10 per cent to 1,489 million tonnes and vehicle kilometres increased by 4 per cent to 18.8 billion vehicle kilometres (11.7 billion vehicle miles).
  * Excluding 'groupage' the main categories of commodity exported by UK vehicles in 2010 were Foodstuffs (24 per cent of all tonnes lifted) and Chemicals, Machinery & Engines and Leather & Textiles (all 11 per cent).
  * Since the 1990s, there has been a change in the type of vehicle accounting for HGV activity. The percentage share of freight moved by rigid vehicles declined from 31 per cent in 1989 to 25 per cent in 1999, and to 22 per cent in 2010.
  * In 2010, the amount of goods lifted by UK-registered goods vehicles travelling to or from the UK was 10.6 million tonnes, a 10 per cent increase from 9.6 million tonnes in 2009.
  * Excluding 'groupage' (the consolidation of different goods into a single load), the main categories of commodity exported by UK vehicles in 2010 were Foodstuffs (24 per cent of all tonnes lifted) and Chemicals, Machinery & Engines and Leather & Textiles (all 11 per cent).

## Key points

  * Overall domestic transport greenhouse gas emissions were unchanged between 1990 and 2009. There was an 8 per cent increase between 1990 and 2007, followed by an 8 per cent decrease between 2007 and 2009.
  * Greenhouse gas emissions from UK international shipping/aviation, based on fuel consumed from UK supplies, increased by 75 per cent between 1990 and 2009.
  * Domestic transport and international transport make up 20 per cent and 7 per cent of total UK greenhouse gas emissions, respectively.
  * As a proportion of total UK greenhouse gas emissions, emissions from transport have increased from 18 per cent in 1990 to 27 per cent in 2009.
  * Renewable energy in the form of biofuels blended into petrol and road diesel, made up 3.0 per cent of road transport energy consumption in 2010, up from 0.2 per cent in 2005.

## Key points

  * In 2009, the level of domestic freight was at broadly the same level as in 1991, at around 215 billion tonnes kilometres **(Chart 1)**.
  * Since the late-1980s, more than 60 per cent of goods have been moved by road, although the amount of goods moved by road decreased by 13 per cent between 2008 and 2009 to 137 billion tonnes kilometres and rose to 151 billion tonne kilometres in 2010.
  * Goods moved by rail account for around 9 per cent of all goods moved. In recent years, rail freight has also accounted for around 5 per cent of goods lifted, compared with 9 per cent in 1980/81.
  * In 2010, 2.47 million goods vehicles travelled from Great Britain to mainland Europe, 4 per cent higher than the 2009 total and 76 per cent higher than in 1992.
  * This figure was made up of 1.79 million powered vehicles, up 2 per cent from 2009 and up 133 per cent from 1992, and 673 thousand unaccompanied trailers, up 10 per cent from 2009 and up 7 per cent from 1992.

## Key points

  * UK sea ports handled 512 million tonnes of freight traffic in 2010, an increase of 2 per cent on 2009, but 12 per cent lower than in the peak year of 2005.
  * Traffic on UK domestic waters accounted for 6 per cent (110 million tonnes) of all goods lifted in the UK, and 22 per cent (49 billion tonne-km) of all goods moved (2009 figures).
  * In 2010, there were 23.5 million international sea passenger journeys to and from the UK, up just under half a million on 2009. Dover was the busiest passenger seaport, handling 60 per cent of international sea passengers.

## Key points

  * In 2010, there were a total of 208,648 reported road casualties of all severities, 39 per cent lower than in 1990.
  * A total of 1,850 people were killed, 65 per cent lower than in 1990, 22,660 were seriously injured (down 63 per cent) and 184,138 were slightly injured (down 33 per cent). Between 1990 and 2010 traffic grew by 20 per cent.
  * There were 206,850 casualties (slight injuries, serious injuries and fatalities), 5 per cent less than the year ending June 2010.
  * Excluding suicides, in 2010/11 there were 40 fatalities on the National Rail network, a 43 per cent fall from 2009/10 when there were 70. This reduction is mainly due to a large fall in the number of trespassers killed, 27 of whom were killed in 2010/11 compared to 50 the year before. There were also 8 passenger fatalities, 1 member of the workforce and 4 members of the public (excluding trespassers).
  * Excluding attempted suicides, there were 395 major injuries in 2010/11 compared to 396 the previous year. This number has fallen by 21 per cent since 2001/02. Overall casualties rose by 2 per cent from 12,585 in 2009/10 to 12,841 in 2010/11, although this follows six consecutive years of falls. Passenger kilometres rose by 6 per cent from 2009/10 to 2010/11, and have risen by 38 per cent since 2001/02.

## Key points

  * In 2010, the overall motor vehicle traffic volume in Great Britain was 1.6 per cent lower than in 2009, at 308.1 billion vehicle miles.
  * Motor vehicle traffic has fallen for three consecutive years for the first time since records began in 1949. However, traffic levels in 2010 were 6.2 per cent higher than in 2000.
  * In 2010, motorways and 'A' roads accounted for 0.9 per cent and 11.8 per cent respectively of total road length in Great Britain. In contrast, 19.8 per cent of all motor vehicle traffic was on motorways and 44.3 per cent on 'A' roads.
  * Forty nine per cent of cars on motorways were travelling at a speed that exceeded the 70 mph limit.
  * The average speed achieved on local authority managed 'A' roads during the morning peak in 2010/11 was 25.1 mph.
  * In 2010/11, nearly Â£5.8 billion was raised through vehicle excise duty (VED), and about Â£27.3 billion was raised through fuel tax.

This publication presents estimates of the proportion of traffic and number of vehicles that evaded vehicle excise duty (VED/road tax) in 2011 in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The estimates of VED evasion are derived by directly observing registration marks from traffic at various sites around the country and comparing these with records held by the government licensing agencies.

## Key points

  * About 0.7 per cent of traffic on both British roads and roads in Northern Ireland was driving without a valid tax disc in 2011.
  * The lowest rate of evasion was seen in the bus (0.1 per cent) and goods vehicles (0.4 per cent) tax classes. The highest rate was seen in the motorcycle tax class (2.1 per cent). The private and light goods vehicle tax class (PLG), which accounts for about 89 per cent of all licensed vehicles, had an evasion rate of 0.7 per cent.
  * The overall rate of unlicensed vehicles 'in stock' in Great Britain in 2011 was estimated to be 0.7 per cent. This equates to roughly 249 thousand vehicles. This is down from the 307 thousand vehicles estimated for 2010.
  * It is estimated that VED evasion could have cost around Â£40 million in lost revenue in Great Britain in 2011/12. This is down from Â£46 million in 2010/11.
  * Some of this revenue will have been recovered through DVLA enforcement activity or through vehicle keepers back-licensing their vehicles.

## Key points

  * The number of licensed vehicles in Great Britain has increased from about 4 million in 1950 to over 34 million in 2010.
  * The number of licensed vehicles has grown by about 3.7 per cent a year on average from 1950 to 2010. However, it grew by 0.7 per cent in 2008, 0.1 per cent in 2009 and 0.5 per cent in 2010. Aside from 1990 to 1991, the growth since 2008 has been the lowest growth period on record.
  * Over 28.2 million MOT tests were carried out in 2010/11. The vast majority of these (26.6 million) were of cars and other small passenger vehicles (up to 12 seats). The overall pass rate was remained steady at around 70 per cent since 2000/01.
  * The proportion of households with access to car or van has risen from 14 per cent in 1951 to 75 per cent in 2010. Since 2002 there have been more households with access to two or more cars/vans than without any access at all.
  * The average annual mileage of four-wheeled cars has decreased from 9,700 miles in 1995/97 to 8,430 in 2010.
  * The number of car practical driving tests taken rose to by 3.6 per cent from 1.59 million in 2009/10 to 1.65 million in 2010/11. Roughly 51 to 54 per cent of the tests each year were taken by males.

## Key points

  * Over the long term there has been an increase in the distance travelled by all modes driven mainly by an increase in the distance travelled by road, and in particular by cars, vans and taxis, although there was a fall in 2010.
  * In addition, the proportion of travel by cars, vans and taxis rose from just over a quarter from 1952 to a peak of nearly ninety per cent in the early 1990s and has remained almost at those levels since then.
  * Total public spending on transport in the United Kingdom, including capital spending by public corporations, in 2010/11 was Â£22.9 billion.
  * Of this about one third was on railways, including tubes, and about a quarter on local roads. This rises to 41 per cent when expenditure on both national and local roads is included.
  * The overall cost of motoring (including purchase, petrol, oil, tax and insurance) has only risen slowly, although there was a larger increase in 2010, and more slowly than the increase in the cost of living as measured by the all items Retail Prices Index (RPI). However when the purchase of vehicle is removed, motoring running costs have risen faster than the RPI.

## Key points

  * Since privatisation (1994/95), the number of franchised journeys made by national rail has increased by 84 per cent, from 0.7 billion to 1.4 billion in 2010/11 (42 per cent since 2000/01).
  * There were 1.1 billion passenger journeys on the London Underground and 13 million journeys on the Glasgow Subway in 2010/11.
  * Light rail and tram passenger journeys in England increased by 5.5 per cent between 2009/10 and 2010/11. In 2010/11 there were 196.5 million passenger journeys. This represents the highest number of passenger journeys to date.
  * There were 4.6 billion bus passenger journeys in England in 2010/11. This is a 0.1 per cent increase from the 2009/10 level. Journeys in London increased by 1.4 per cent over this period and now account for nearly half (49 per cent) of all bus passenger journeys in England.

## Key points

  * There were nearly 211 million **terminal passengers** (arrivals and departures) at UK airports in 2010, a fall of 3 per cent since 2009 and 12 per cent since the peak in 2007.
  * There were 2 million **air transport movements** (take-offs and landings) in 2010, 6 per cent fewer than in 2009. 
  * **Freight** handled at UK airports increased by 14 per cent to 2.3 million tonnes, following a sharp fall in 2009.
  * **Heathrow** is the UK's busiest airport, handling 22 per cent of air transport movements, 31 per cent of terminal passengers and 63 per cent of freight tonnes in 2010.
  * In 2010, the five **London airports** accounted for 60 per cent of all terminal passengers at UK airports, down from 65 per cent in 2000.
  * The majority (71 per cent) of **international passenger movements** at UK airports in 2010 were to/from European origins/destinations. The most common country of origin/destination was Spain (including the Canary Islands), which accounted for 17 per cent.
  * In 2010, visiting friends and relatives (VFR) was the most common **purpose of travel** at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton. The proportion of passengers who are visiting friends/relatives has increased over the last decade at all 5 of the main UK airports.
  * There were 49 **casualties** caused by accidents in UK airspace in 2010 and 167 **aircraft proximity incidents**.

## Key points

The report covers the following issues:

  * Over the decade to 2010, goods lifted on UK waters fell by 23 per cent and goods moved fell by 37 per cent, but there were fluctuations up until 2005 for both goods moved and lifted. Since 2009, goods lifted and goods moved have fallen by 3 and 13 per cent respectively and have declined since 2008 by 14 and 15 per cent respectively.
  * In 2010, 71 per cent of goods moved on UK domestic waters was traffic around the coast; 26 per cent was one-port traffic (to or from offshore installations, or dredged materials) and 3 per cent was inland waters traffic (including both non-seagoing traffic and seagoing traffic crossing into inland waters).
  * Since 2000, coastwise traffic has fallen by 18 per cent in terms of goods moved. In 2010, coastwise traffic fell by 14 per cent compared with 2009.
  * One-port traffic has fallen by 64 per cent in the decade since 2000 in terms of goods moved. Traffic for 2010 was 15 per cent lower than in 2009.
  * In the decade since 2000, inland waters traffic has fallen by 18 per cent. However, at 1.4 billion tonne-kilometres, inland waters traffic is 7 per cent higher than in 2009.
  * Crude petroleum and petroleum products were the main type of cargo moved in 2010, accounting for 67 per cent of all waterborne freight moved.
  * The River Thames was the busiest of the major inland waterways, with 0.55 billion tonne-kilometres of goods moved (40 per cent of inland waters total) in 2010. This was followed by the River Forth and the River Humber (both at 0.17 billion tonne-kilometres).

## Overview

This publication presents information on motor vehicles in Great Britain that were licensed on the 31 December 2011 (the end of quarter 4/end of the year), or were registered for the first time during 2011. The statistics are derived from data held by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which administers vehicle registration and licensing records in Great Britain.

## Key findings include:

  * At the end of 2011 there were 34.2 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads in Great Britain, of which 28.5 million were cars.
  * Between 2010 and 2011 the total vehicle stock number increased by 0.3 per cent. Since the recession of 2008-09 the annual growth in licensed vehicles has only averaged 0.4 per cent, lower than the 2.4 per cent averaged between 1996 and 2007.
  * Just over 2.38 million vehicles were registered for the first time in Great Britain in 2011. This represents a 36 thousand vehicle, or 1.5 per cent, decrease from the previous year. However, the 2010 first registration figures received a boost from the previous government's Vehicle Scrappage Scheme.
  * The number of newly registered cars powered by diesel has continued to rise. For the first time the proportion of cars registered for the first time that run on diesel has tipped over the 50 per cent mark.
  * Average emissions from all the licensed cars first registered from 2001 onwards was down by 1.5 per cent from 2010 to an average of 163 g/km. The average CO2 emissions from cars newly registered in the year fell by over 4 per cent from 2010 to an average figure of 138 g/km. Since 2001 the average emissions of new cars has fallen by over 21 per cent.
  * At the end of 2011, the most common car in Great Britain was the Ford Focus (1.4 million) followed by the Ford Fiesta (1.3 million).

## Summary

The overall trend in the number of licensed vehicles and first registrations is influenced by the general economic climate in Great Britain. Although there has a been a small increase in the number of licensed vehicles from 34.1 million at the end of 2010 to 34.2 million at the end of 2011, the annual growth of 0.3 per cent is still low in the historical context. A significant part of this slow increase has been due to strong falls in the number of licensed heavy goods vehicles and buses & coaches over recent years. Licensing trends in these vehicles reflect economic fluctuations more strongly than any other vehicle type and the economic downturn since 2008 will have been a significant influence on the fall in the number of license vehicles in these categories.

In addition, there has been a shift from smaller to larger HGVs over recent years, which means that more goods can be carried on each trip and probably results in fewer vehicles being needed for deliveries.

New vehicle registrations appear to be on a general downward trend from a peak in the early-2000s. The economic downturn is likely to have affected the figures from 2008 onwards, but the downward trend was already apparent before the recession began. The number of first registrations fell by 1.5 per cent between 2010 and 2011, with just over 2.38 million vehicles registered for the first time in 2011. Of these, 1.9 million were cars; this was 88 thousand fewer than in 2010. However, it should be noted that the previous government's Vehicle Scrappage Scheme which ran from May 2009 to the end of March 2010 will have boosted the number of first registrations completed in 2010. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills estimate that once the effects of the incentive scheme have been adjusted for, the underlying trend in new car sales actually rose by around 1 per cent between 2010 and 2011.

Overall, aside from 2009 during which the economy was in recession, 2011 had the lowest total number of first registrations since 1995.

The proportion of new cars that are company-owned climbed steadily from around 47 per cent in 2001 to 60 per cent in 2008. During 2009 it fell sharply to 50 per cent, and this was the main cause of the fall in the number of first registrations during the recession. However, the company-owned share of cars registered for the first time grew in both 2010 and 2011 and has now returned to its pre-recession level of around 60 per cent.

The 4.4 per cent fall in new car registrations in 2011 has been entirely due to a reduction in demand in the private market with fewer than 800 thousand private first registrations happening for the first time since records started in 2001.

There is evidence that motorists are continuing to move towards cars with lower running costs. The proportion of diesel, small engine and low CO2-emitting cars are increasing, especially in the new vehicle market. Such cars tend to sit in lower-cost Vehicle Excise Duty bands and have greater fuel efficiency than petrol, larger engine or higher CO2-emitting cars. In addition, hybrid electric and pure electric cars are becoming more common, albeit from a very low base, especially since the [plug-in car grant](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/sustainable/olev/plug-in-car-grant) was introduced for ultra-low emission cars in January 2011.

By the end of 2011, the most common car in Great Britain was the Ford Focus, with 1.4 million licensed vehicles, followed by the Ford Fiesta, with 1.3 million licensed vehicles. These were closely followed by the Vauxhall Astra and Vauxhall Corsa (both around 1.1 million). Between them, Ford and Vauxhall account for 27 per cent off all licensed cars. The top five marques (Ford, Vauxhall, Volkswagen, Peugeot and Renault) together account for 50 per cent of licensed cars.

Ford has had the model of car with the most new registrations every year since 2001, with the sole exception of 2007. The Ford Fiesta had the highest number of first registration during 2011 with 98 thousand vehicles; this is the fourth year in a row that the Fiesta has held this position. The Vauxhall Corsa was in top position in 2007 and the Ford Focus was top from 2001 to 2006.

## Key points

### In the eight months of the 2011/12 obligation period:

  * 5.4 billion litres of biofuel have been supplied under the RTFO in the first 44 months.
  * In the eight months of the 2011/12 obligation period, 983 million litres of biofuel have been supplied, which is approximately 3.2% of total road transport fuel against an annual obligation percentage (""specified amount"") of 4.0%
  * More biodiesel (56%) has been supplied than bioethanol (44%). A small volume of biogas has also been declared to the administrator.
  * The largest proportion of biofuel came from the feedstock, used cooking oil (489m litres, 50% of total biofuel supplied). The most widely reported feedstock from a single country of origin for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the Netherlands (153m litres, 28% of biodiesel supplied). The most widely reported feedstock and country of bioethanol was non-European Community corn from the United States of America (336m litres, 77% of bioethanol supplied).
  * Over the period, 53% of biofuels met an environmental standard.
  * The majority of feedstock has been imported; 12% of the biofuel was reported as coming from UK feedstocks.
  * 93% of the fuel reported as coming from UK feedstocks met environmental sustainability standards.

This publication presents information on the condition of local authority roads, motorways and trunk roads in England. These data include revisions to the 2009/10 road conditions index and highways conditions index series (Tables RDC0101 to RDC0107) to correct previous processing errors and to incorporate data previously unavailable the last time the bulletin was released.

**Update 22 June 2012: Data for 2010/11 in Table RDC0120 relating to the London Borough of Haringey have been revised** following corrections supplied by the borough council. This table relates to the percentage of classified roads where maintenance should be considered, and the revision affects both ""Principal"" and ""Non-principal"" roads.

**Update 31 July 2012: An error has been indentified in the published Road Condition Index statistics for classified local authority roads in England.** An initial investigation shows that this error affects data for the period 2006-07 to 2010-11 inclusive.

We apologise for this error and any inconvenience caused by it.

The following affected documents were removed from the DfT website on 31 July 2012 to allow the error to be investigated further and corrected:

  * Road Conditions in England statistical releases
  * Road Conditions statistical tables RDC0101 to RDC0107

The problem was identified while statisticians were investigating differences between the DfT's Road Conditions Index and figures reported by local authorities (single data list items 130-01 and 130-02 - table RDC0120). This table is not affected by the error and continues to be available.

The Department for Transport will re-issue a set of revised data for the Road Conditions Index covering 2006-07 to 2010-11 in due course and will notify users of the planned date(s) for the release of the revised figures once available.

All other statistics on road condition and road maintenance are unaffected by this error. These consist of:

  * surface condition of unclassified roads (tables [RDC0130](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/rdc0130.xls) and [RDC0131](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/rdc0131.xls))

## Key points

  * Over 90 per cent of passengers at each of the four airports surveyed in 2011 said they were very or fairly satisfied with their experiences at security screening.
  * The aspects of security screening with which passengers were least satisfied were:  
- queuing (mentioned by 7%)  
- removal of shoes (6%)  
- restriction of liquids (5%).  
The majority of passengers (68%) said there was no aspect with which they were least satisfied.
  * The average time spent passengers said they spent queuing for security screening ranged from 5.1 minutes at Manchester to 8.3 minutes at Stansted.
  * Overall, 13% of passengers at these four airports said they did not have to queue, over half (56%) said they queued for 5 minutes or less and 10% said they queued for over 10 minutes.
  * The majority of passengers (89%) agreed that any inconvenience caused by the security screening was acceptable.
  * Among the three airports which have been surveyed in each year since 2008 (Heathrow, Manchester and Stansted), levels of satisfaction have improved at Heathrow over this period, but stayed more or less the same at Stansted and at Manchester, which has had consistently high levels of satisfaction. At Gatwick, which was surveyed in 2009 and 2011, levels of satisfaction have improved over this period.

This statistical release presents road traffic estimates for Great Britain in 2011. These estimates have been revised to correct for a small error found in the estimates published on 28June 2012. The original estimates omitted data for a small number of sections of the road network in Scotland. Further details of the correction can be found in the document below:

## Summary

Since the 1950s the long term trend in the volume of road traffic has been one of growth, peaking at 314.1 billion vehicle miles in 2007. Following the peak in road traffic in 2007, motor vehicle traffic then fell for three consecutive years; the first consecutive annual falls since traffic records began. In contrast, between 2010 and 2011 traffic volumes were broadly stable.

## Key points

  * In 2011 the overall motor vehicle traffic volume in Great Britain was 303.8 billion vehicle miles compared to 303.2 billion vehicle miles in 2010. This is broadly stable after three consecutive years of falls.
  * Car traffic increased slightly by 0.4 per cent in the last year to 240.7 billion vehicle miles.
  * In 2011, light goods vehicle (LGV) traffic grew for the second consecutive year by 0.8 per cent to 41.4 billion vehicle miles. LGV traffic peaked in 2007, with recent increases not being large enough to cancel out the falls experienced in 2008 and 2009.
  * Increases in car and LGV traffic between 2010 and 2011 were offset by decreases in heavy goods vehicle (HGV) and bus and coach traffic.
  * HGV traffic has decreased by 2.7 per cent since 2010 to 15.9 billion vehicle miles. HGV traffic has fallen by 8.6 per cent since 2001.
  * Bus and coach traffic has decreased by 7.6 per cent since 2010 to 2.9 billion vehicle miles. Bus traffic has fallen by 9.1 per cent since 2001.

This publication presents information on the number and pass rates of driving and riding tests conducted in Great Britain to 31st March 2012 (covering the whole of the 2011/12 financial year).

The statistics are derived from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which administers the driving test and training schemes in Great Britain.

A supplementary bulletin will be released in July. This will contain more detailed tables providing breakdowns of test passes by age of candidate and number of test attempts.

## Key points

  * A total of 427,491 tests were conducted across all practical test categories (excluding ADI tests) between January and March 2012 (Q4 2011/12). This represents an overall decrease of 9.9 per cent in comparison with the same quarter in 2010/11.
  * In total, around 1.74 million practical driving / riding tests (excluding ADI tests) were conducted during 2011/12, down by 1.3 per cent from the 1.77 million tests conducted during 2010/11. However, the 2011/12 total was higher than the 2009/10 total of 1.68 million.
  * The practical car test pass rate has increased slightly from 44 per cent in 2007/08 to almost 47 per cent in 2011/12.
  * It is likely that the prevailing economic situation has led to fewer people undertaking commercial vehicle tests. The number of large goods vehicle tests fell from 70,766 in 2007/08 to 46,549 in 2011/12. The corresponding figures for passenger carrying vehicles were 10,331 in 2007/08 and 8,456 in 2011/12.
  * At the end of 2011/12, there were 46,569 approved driving instructors on the Register. Of these, over 99 per cent scored a grade four or better at their last check test.

## Key points

  * The annual number of people killed in road accidents reported to the police has increased, by 3 per cent, from 1,850 in 2010 to 1,901 in 2011. This is the first increase since 2003.
  * The number of people reported killed or seriously injured has also increased by 2 per cent to 25,023 from 24,510 in 2010 - the first annual increase since 1994.
  * The total number of casualties (slight injuries, serious injuries and fatalities) in road accidents reported to the police in Great Britain in 2011 continued to fall, by 2 per cent, from 208,648 in 2010 to 203,950 in 2011.
  * Total reported child casualties (ages 0-15) have continued to fall, by 0.5 per cent in 2011 to 19,474. The number of children killed or seriously injured also fell, decreasing by 4 per cent to 2,412 in 2011, from 2,502 in 2010.
  * Vehicle traffic levels are broadly stable after falling for 3 years. The overall casualty rate for accidents reported to the police per billion vehicle miles continued to fall to 666 per billion vehicle miles, compared to 681 casualties per billion vehicle miles in 2010 but the killed or seriously injured rate increased to 82 per billion vehicle miles.

## Key points

  * Compared to 2001, the percentage of vehicles exceeding the 30 mph speed limit on built-up roads has fallen for every vehicle type. Between 2010 and 2011, the percentage of cars and motorcycles exceeding the 30 mph speed limit increased to 47 and 50 per cent respectively.
  * On motorways, 49 per cent of cars exceeded the 70 mph speed limit in 2011, unchanged from 2010. Thirteen per cent of cars in 2011 were recorded as travelling at 80 mph or faster, continuing the downward trend seen in recent years.
  * Over 83 per cent of articulated heavy goods vehicles exceeded the 50 mph speed limit on dual carriageway and 71 per cent exceeded the 40 mph limit on single carriageway non-built-up roads.
  * In 2011, motorcycles had the highest average free flow speeds across all road types except motorways. In addition 20 per cent of motorcycles were travelling 10 mph or more above the speed limit on motorways and 21 per cent on dual carriageways, the highest proportion of any vehicle for these road types.

## Key points

  * The total road length in Great Britain in 2011 was estimated to be 245.0 thousand miles, an increase of 2.1 thousand miles (0.9 per cent) over 10 years.
  * Minor roads made up 87 per cent of total road length, with motorways and 'A' roads accounting for 1 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.
  * Despite accounting for only 13 per cent of road length in 2011, major roads (motorways and 'A' roads) accounted for 65 per cent of road traffic.
  * The trunk road network (centrally managed motorways and 'A' roads) accounted for 7.5 thousand miles, a decrease of 1.7 thousand miles since 2001. This decrease reflects the government's de-trunking program (the transfer of centrally managed roads to local authorities).

## Key points

  * On a typical weekday in autumn 2011, 532 thousand passengers arrived into central London by rail during the morning peak. This compared to 443 thousand passengers departing central London during the afternoon peak.
  * Outside London, Birmingham had the highest number of passengers travelling during the peaks, with 36 thousand arrivals in the morning peak and 40 thousand departures in the afternoon peak.
  * Overall crowding across both peaks, as measured by the percentage of passengers in excess of capacity (PiXC), was 3.2 per cent in 2011 on London & South East rail services. This was an increase from 3.0 per cent in 2010. Crowding in the morning peak stayed level at 4.0 per cent of passengers in excess of capacity, but afternoon peak PiXC increased from 1.9 per cent in 2010 to 2.3 per cent in 2011.
  * First Great Western had the highest level of PiXC of any London & South East operator with 10.5 per cent across both peaks, although this was a fall from 16.6 per cent in 2010.
  * Birmingham had the highest crowding outside London in the morning peak in 2011 with 3.1 per cent of passengers in excess of capacity. Manchester had the highest crowding in the afternoon peak with 2.5 per cent of passengers in excess of capacity.

This publication provides further detailed breakdowns of the number of car and motorcycle tests conducted in Great Britain in 2011/12. These tables are to compliment the ones released in June 2012. They provide breakdowns by age, gender and number of pass attempts.

The test and instructor statistics are derived from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which administers the driving test and training schemes in Great Britain.

A complete back series to 2007/08 (for car tests) and 2009/10 (for motorcycle tests) will be released in the 2012/13 quarter 1 publication, due out in August. The tables will then be updated annually in the future.

## Key points

  * Roughly 47 per cent of practical car tests in 2011/12 were taken by people aged 20 or under. Candidates aged 17 dominate even within this group as they accounted for 20 per cent of all tests in 2011/12. As the age band increases, the band accounts for progressively smaller proportions of all tests. Only 12 per cent of tests during the year were undertaken by candidates aged 36 or over.
  * As well as accounting for the highest proportion of test candidates, 17-year olds also had the highest pass rate at 56 per cent in 2011/12.

Source: [DRT0203](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/drt0203.xls)

  * At almost every age, male candidates had a higher pass rate than female candidates. The difference tends to be greater for older age groups. Male candidates aged 17 had a 2.9 percentage point higher pass rate than female candidates of the same age.
  * Of all the test passes achieved in 2011/12, 45 per cent occurred on the candidate's first attempt.
  * Module 1 motorcycle test passes show a similar age pattern to that of cars, with the highest pass rate being 17-year old males and the pass rate generally decreasing with age. Males aged 17 had a 79 per cent pass rate in Module 1 tests in 2011/12; this is considerably higher than the corresponding 58 per cent pass rate for 17-year old females.
  * Module 2 motorcycle pass rates appear less related to age than Module 1 pass rates. In 2011/12, 17-year olds had a pass rate of 63 per cent. The pass rate was slightly lower for 18-year olds before rising to 65 to 66 per cent for 19- and 20-year olds and remaining between 68 to 71 per cent for candidates in the 20s, 30s and 40s.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/accessibility-statistics-2011,Accessibility statistics: 2011,This statistical release presents information on accessibility statistics for England for 2011.,"## Summary

This statistical release presents information on accessibility statistics for England for 2011.

The accessibility statistics provide a local-level measure of the availability of transport to key services (covering food stores, education, health care, town centres and employment centres) for the populations who use them. They are widely used in accessibility planning by local authorities.

Changes in travel times and accessibility can be caused by three factors:

  * the number and location of service destinations;

  * the quality of the service destinations datasets;

  * and road / travel factors (such as public transport timetables, road layout and congestion).

In most the cases changes in the first two factors (i.e. relating to the number and location of destinations and data quality) will have a greater affect on average travel times than changes in timetables.

This release provides a summary of the statistics at national and regional level. The full set of results, including figures at Local Authority and Lower Super Output Area level, are available in separate files.

## Key points

  * The average minimum travel time to the seven key services (excluding town centres) was 14 minutes by public transport/walking, 9 minutes by cycling and 6 minutes by car. These times were 0.55 minutes longer than in 2010 for public transport/walking and around 0.2 minutes longer than in 2010 for both cycling and by car.

* Average of key services excluding town centres

Source: [ACS0101](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/acs0101.xls)

  * As in previous years, hospitals had the longest average minimum travel times of the seven key services in 2011 with average minimum travel times of 30 minutes by public transport/walking, 21 minutes by cycling and 9 minutes by driving. Primary schools and foods stores were the most accessible services.

  * Users in urban areas could access key services by public transport/walking, on average, in 12 minutes compared with 22 minutes in rural areas.

  * The proportion of users able to access key services by public transport/walking in a 'reasonable' time was highest for employment centres (81%). The lowest was for hospitals (29%).

  * Overall access to key services by public transport/walking within a 'reasonable' time was greatest in London and lowest in the East of England.

## Update 16 August 2012:

The figures in table LRT0103, LRT0104, LRT0107 and LRT0108 were updated following corrections to the passenger kilometres figure supplied for Manchester Metrolink.

## Key points

  * In 2011/12, there were 204 million passenger journeys on light rail and tram systems in England, the highest annual figure recorded and continuing the upward trend of recent years.

  * The overall increase in journeys has been driven by strong growth in London (Docklands Light Railway and Croydon Tramlink) of nearly 60 per cent since 2004/05, with growth of 8 per cent between 2010/11 and 2011/12.
  * Patronage outside London has been broadly stable since 2004/05. Between 2010/11 and 2011/12, there was overall reduction in journeys of 1 per cent, with growth on the expanding Manchester Metrolink offset by falls in other areas.
  * In 2011/12, there were 14.5 million vehicle miles run on light rail and tram systems in England, an increase of 4 per cent from the previous year, with growth of 8 per cent overall since 2004/05.

## Key points

  * Provisional data for 2012 shows that average speeds during the weekday morning peak on locally managed 'A' roads in England were slower in April (4.4 per cent), stable in May (up 0.2 per cent) and slightly slower in June (0.6 per cent) compared to the same months in 2011. 
  * The decreases in April and June were likely to have been influenced by the substantial amount of rainfall experienced in those months. April 2012 was the wettest April in England and June 2012 the second wettest June since records began in 1910. 
  * Annual average 'weekday morning peak' speeds showed an upward trend between the years ending December 2010 and February 2012. Other than a decrease in average speeds in the year ending April 2012, average speeds have been fairly static since.",statistics-national-statistics,9-Aug-2012,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,,,road-congestion-and-reliability-statistics,Vehicles,Road transport,,,,department-for-transport,http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/congestion-on-local-authority-managed-a-roads-april-to-june-2012/august12-congestion-local-a-release.pdf,"Congestion on local authority managed 'A' roads: April to June 2012 (PDF, 49 KB)",http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/congestion-on-local-authority-managed-a-roads-april-to-june-2012/LA-april-to-june-2012-csv.zip,"Congestion on local authority managed 'A' roads: April to June 2012 and all XLS tables(ZIP, 92 KB)",http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/congestion-on-local-authority-managed-a-roads-april-to-june-2012/LA-april-to-june-2012-xls.zip,"Congestion on local authority managed 'A' roads: April to June 2012 and all CSV tables (ZIP, 66 KB)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,020 7944 6579,congestion.stats@dft.gsi.gov.uk,Quarterly,Local authorities,England
