http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/businessratestechnical,Business Rates Retention: Technical Consultation,department-for-communities-and-local-government,Business rates retention: technical details,"This technical consultation builds on the proposals in the government response to consultation published in December 2011, and on the statements of intent published on 17 May 2012.

It seeks views on a range of detailed technical issues concerning practical implementation of those proposals, particularly focusing on how the Government proposes to calculate local authority start-up funding allocations, baseline funding levels as well as other parameters which are required for the setup and operation of the business rates retention scheme. As such, it will be of particular interest to local authority finance departments responsible for implementing and running the new scheme.

Section 2 focuses on establishing baseline funding levels for each local authority, as well as the methodology for allocating Revenue Support Grant which will be paid.

The December 2011 consultation response stated that, in the interests of maintaining as much stability as possible, these would be calculated on the basis of the 2012/13 formula grant process with updated data sets and some limited technical updates. This section details proposals for making those calculations and includes exemplifications of the proposed options. It also covers transfers and adjustments to the local government spending controls total and includes proposed methodologies for incorporating those separate grant funding streams being included in the business rates retention scheme from April 2013.

Section 3 outlines other parameters which need to be determined when setting up the business rates retention system - particularly in relation to establishing individual local authority business rate baselines.

Section 4 details proposals on how the system will operate once it has been set up. It is arranged chronologically, to give local authorities the best idea of how the scheme will operate year-by-year. The calculation of levy and safety net payments is set out in this section. The safety net will fall within the 7.5%-10% range and funded by a 1:1 levy as already announced.

Section 5 covers the proposed approach to closing the 2012-13 national non domestic rating account.

The Department has published a number of documents to supplement the technical consultation on business rates retention. These documents set out the proposed approach for the London share of business rates and an alternative option for funding the New Homes Bonus. In addition, the Department has published supplementary information on proportionate shares as well as population data. These documents can be found below. Responses to additional consultation questions should be sent as part of the responses to the technical consultation.",17-Jul-2012,24-Sep-2012,9781409835738,Andrew Lock,,mailto:brrtechnicalconsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk,giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/21825021.pdf,Business Rates Retention Scheme: Technical Consultation,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/doc/2217848.doc,Combined Effect of the Methodology Changes exemplification,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/21825221.xls,Concessionary Travel exemplification,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/21825271.xls,Log of Weighted Bars exemplification,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/21825501.xls,Resource Equalisation exemplification,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/21825551.xls,Rural Services exemplification - after floor damping,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/21825671.xls,Rural Services exemplification - before floor damping,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2193077.pdf,Splitting 2012-13 Formula Grant between the service tiers: Covering note and Annex A,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2193082.xls,Annex B: 1990-91 Assumed Debt and New Debt for 1990-91 to 2012-13 exemplification,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2193091.xls,Annex C: 2012-13 Settlement - Relative Needs Formula by Sub-block exemplification,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2193108.xls,Annex D: Breakdown of Formula Grant exemplification,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2193112.xls,Annex E: Formula Grant Model,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2193116.pdf,Population Data: Covering note,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2193119.xls,Population Data exemplification,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2203293.pdf,New Homes Bonus - Alternative Option,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2203298.pdf,Proposed Share of Business Rates in London,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2204961.pdf,Proportionate Shares: Covering note,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2204965.xls,Proportionate Shares,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/xls/2208979.xls,Proportionate Shares Calculations,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/localgovernment/pdf/2182628.pdf,Business Rates Retention: Technical Consultation - Equality Statement,,,,,,

Responses to a December 2008 consultation: _Definition of zero carbon homes and non-domestic buildings_ recognised the case for regulation. However, in the light of current economic conditions, it is also important to consider the costs and potential consequences of such regulation on economic recovery for the construction sector and balance these with the benefits of early certainty around a route-map for future regulatory steps.

This consultation therefore sets out policy principles and further modelling work, and seeks views on these and their implications for viability for individual developments and sectors. The proposal to apply the zero carbon standard to new public sector buildings (including some Crown Estate buildings, which are exempt from Building Regulations) is discussed separately.",24-Nov-2009,26-Feb-2010,9781409820376,,,,improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment,,,,20-Dec-2010,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/1804259.pdf,Zero carbon for new non-domestic buildings consultation: summary of responses,"This report provides a summary of responses to the consultation document, _Zero carbon for new non-domestic buildings._ The consultation related to proposals for working towards the ambition that all new non-domestic buildings should be zero carbon from 2019, with the public sector leading the way from 2018.

An overview of responses to all questions shows that:

  * there was strong support for the majority of the proposals on zero carbon non-domestic buildings, with 75% or more respondents agreeing with six of the nine questions to which they could answer 'Yes'
  * around half of respondents were in favour of balancing on-site and off-site measures, with similar proportions supporting off-site rich and on-site rich measures - a significant proportion of developers/builders favoured the off-site rich scenario
  * there was little support for the proposal to set a flat rate requirement above 100% regulated emissions to account for unregulated emissions and there was a mixed reaction to the package of measures and proposals for next steps
  * overall, there were no marked sectoral differences in views and any differences were question-dependent - however, support for some of the proposals was less strong among the energy sector
  * the overall numbers responding to each of the 13 questions ranged between 83 and 98, with all questions attracting a response rate of 75% or more",9781409825999,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/newnondomesticconsult?view=Order+form&supplierId=1403822,Order this publication,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/1391110.pdf,Zero carbon for New Non-Domestic Buildings: Consultation on policy options,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/doc/1416885.doc,Zero Carbon for New Non-domestic Buildings: Consultation on Policy Options,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/doc/1391113.doc,Response form: Zero carbon for New Non-Domestic Buildings Consultation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
